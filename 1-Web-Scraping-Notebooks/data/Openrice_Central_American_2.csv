Central,American,I wanted the weekend brunch with free flow but the craving for a good pizza took over me. Finis is one of the best places for pizza. The Bronx hits the spot. Fried calamari was great and tiramisu was a bit jelly like and not too sweet. Looking forward to my next visit. 000000,Fini's,nan,200,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-finis/614574?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
Central,American,"Shake shack - a world famous burger joint  that has taken social media by storm has finally landed in Hong Kong. No more fantasising from checking out Instagram photos Hongkongers but it also means that people are going crazy about this place. I went to this restaurant much later than usual (a whole year after opening) hoping to minimise my queuing time and this proved me wrong. The restaurant was super packed and I waited in the queue for 15 mins to place order, plus another 10 minutes before I could devour my burgers. Knowing that it might be the last time to visit, we ordered everything we wanted in one go. Shack burger (double) - cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato, shacksauceAlways loved brioche buns for the fluffiness and buttery sweet flavour that go well with any ingredients. The beef patty was thick, juicy and slightly seasoned, with melted cheese clinging to it. The vegetables were fresh and crisp too but the shacksauce didnt really stand out. Not bad but not something unforgettable. Shroom burger - Deep fried portobello mushroom filled with muenster and cheddar cheese, topped with lettuce, tomato, shacksauceThis one was a must-try! The crispy and slightly chewy portobello mushroom with oozing cheese was the most satisfying ever! The vegetables balanced out the fattiness and saltiness of the cheese and all of these made a burger in heaven! Hamburger with lettuce, tomato and onionsTheir hamburger was rather ordinary without the shacksauce and cheese. Not that its not yummy but probably more for people who like it simple. Cheese friesI prefer crunchy and thick cut fries so Shake Shacks version easily ticked my boxes, only if the fries were slightly more seasoned. The cheese sauce was alright but didnt lift the flavours too much. Finish this quickly or else the fries will get soggy. Coffee shakeWoah this is the shake I am talking about! Thick, creamy and full of coffee aroma from the first sip! Get this if you are a coffee lover. Milk tea shake A flavour only offered in Hong Kong stores so I had high expectations. Sadly, the milk tea flavour resembles that of English milk tea instead of the Hong Kong version. It was a little too sweet for my liking too. Iced teaI thought this would be some kind of sweetened lemon or peach iced tea but it was literally an iced tea. It was still refreshing but could be bland when eaten with burgers and fries. If Im visiting for a second time, Im going for their fifty/fifty (a mix of lemonade and iced tea).0000",Shake Shack,3.3,100,15,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-shake-shack/568104?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw
Central,American,"I brought my parents to lawrys in order to celebreate my dads birthday. I chose the Sunday brunch. I like the environment as it is quite quiet, so you are able to enjoy the family time or chat with friends while enjoying the steak and wine. We ordered steak with medium-rare and it was really good. You are able to see the chef cut the beef in front of you. Besides, we ordered an oyster platter. I will definitely go there again for their beef.0000",Lawrys The Prime Rib,4.6,500,nan,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-lawrys-the-prime-rib/629069?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
Central,American,"Sorry but it didn't live up to expectations and also the reputation it has in other countries. Food was not impressive - got a New York Sirloin and a Dry-Aged Beef Sandwich. The steak had no seasoning and the baguette used for the sandwich was rock hard. Couldn't chew it or rip it off. We took out the stuffing and left the bread.Service - the staff were just chit chatting amongst themselves and singing along to all the songs in the background. There was only 1 other table at the time and they sat on the opposite side. Made the restaurant seem more empty than it needed to be. Not up to par with the Wolfgang image.The Dessert of the Day was Creme Brle, unfortunately the consistency was too thick and gloopy, and the caramelised top was too hard - making the shards difficult to chew.For the price we paid, we could have easily gone to a Michelin Star restaurant.But the french fries were good, my highlight of the meal.",Wolfgang's Steakhouse Hong Kong,1.2,500,nan,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-wolfgangs-steakhouse-hong-kong/528192?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
Central,American,"Was here with 10 coworkers for a farewell lunch. The restaurant was half empty, however they still managed to take 50 mins from order to serving food. We ordered at 13:20 and the main dishes were served at 14:10. The food was disgusting. There is a tiny fly crawling on a salad. The chicken breast tasted more blend than boiled chicken I eat after workout. My friend and I both ordered a medium rare burger, however hers was almost raw and mind was fine. Another friend ordered a medium steak but it looks well-done. My friend demand to cancel the raw burger, because it was already passed our lunch hour and we cannot afford another 50 mins for another burger. And the chefs were really pissed. Like REALLY PISSED. They dead stared at us with arms crossed non stop after we cancel the raw burger. We were being polite and did not blame them for taking a decade to bring food to the table but the chefs figured they should be the one who's angry. They have charged the fee of 4 steaks instead of 3, which was wrong, and they were reluctant to cancel the bill of raw burger which my friend did't even eat. She has to get a sandwich from Seven-Eleven as a farewell lunch. This is the worst experience I've ever had in any restaurant.Supplementary InformationHSBC restaurant week",Craftsteak,1.3,200,50,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-craftsteak/16648?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
Central,American,"We, a group of 10 people, went to Craftsteakfor lunch during the restaurant week promotion. The meal includes starter, maincourse and dessert. For the starter, choices of octopus salad or tuna withavocado ceviche which served in a small portion and both tasted okay. After thestarter, we waited for entire 40 mins for the main course to be served whichwas TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. Knowing that we all went there during limited lunchtime and the restaurant was not even full.Finally, the food came. For the steak, requiredmedium and turned out to be well done. For the chicken breast, very dry andtasteless (not enough seasoning). For the burger, it was okay, a bit dry. Also,obviously they missed one order which was the burger and it was eventuallyserved after 50 mins we placed the order. AND IT WAS RAW! We request it to becancel and the waiter took it away and talked to the chef. The chef then keptstaring at us with an angry face.This is absolutely ridiculous. We came here asthe customer and we pay for the food. Not only the food served late (after 50mins) and it was raw! And we being treated in a very rude way?

Central,American,"I had never known there was such a restaurant famous for its wings until I was brought here by my friend. It was full during lunch on a week day so advanced reservation was better to secure your seats. Interior decoration was ok but seating was not so comfortable because I had to sit on the edge of one sofa.Menu0MenuI was a bit worried at first because the whole menu was full of wings and I was never a fans of wings and wanted to avoid deep-fried food and chicken skin.Menu0MenuLunch Menu0Lunch MenuLuckily I managed to see this Wrap Combo with a soup of the day, Chipotle Avo Wrap, a side, and a drink at a cost of $88 + 10% which was really quite a good bargain.Salad of the Day0Salad of the DayThe soup of the day had become salad of the day instead, which was ok. It was a marginal pass because it was obviously too oily.Sweet Potato Fries0Sweet Potato FriesYou can choose regular fries/salad, lotus root or sweet potato fries. I decided to go for sweet potato fries which were pretty good. There was not much salt seasoning which I really liked. They were rich in sweet potato and weren't too oily. The bad thing was that they were served with no sauce but it could be served on request. I asked for ketchup otherwise it would have been too dry eating them on their own. Overall quality of the fries was pretty good although i would have preferred thicker fries.Wingman Chipotle Avo Wrap0Wingman Chipotle Avo WrapWingman Chipotle Avo Wrap0Wingman Chipotle Avo WrapWe had to wait for a long long time to have our wrap but it was not disappointing. The Chipotle Avo Wrap contained Chipotle pulled Wings, Avocado, Roasted Sweet Peppers, Cherry Tomatoes and Lettuce with Sriracha Mayo. It was pretty GOOD! It was so freshly made that the wrap itself was so thin and slightly crispy. There were loads of ingredients with a lot of pulled wings and veggies. The Sriracha Mayo was very tasty and it was slightly spicy which made it very appetising. I would say there could have been more Avocado though. That said, it was a pretty good wrap and the portion was reasonably big.A drink was included in the set which could be soft drink, iced lemon tea with $10 top up for hot drink at your choice. I ordered coke zero which had nothing special to talk about.Two of my friends ordered their wings. They smelt pretty good when served to us but it was really a bit worrying that it might not be filling enough just having 10 wings. Really had to say that it was super inconvenient to eat the wings with forks. It would have been much better if they could provide gloves for eating the wings. I noticed some other eaters got gloves, maybe on request again?At the end of our meal, a discount of 15% was offered to us as a token of their apology for their late service today. Had to say that the service of the female (seemingly only) server while that of another guy was not so friendly because he always wore a black face.Not a bad place to come back but I think I would still go for the wrap rather than the wings.",Wingman,4.1,84,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-wingman/626030?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

Staff were really friendly and kind, and explained the different flavours.I tried the following:Buffalo wingsSingapore ZingCoffee dry rubHoisin honey and sesameBBQ dry rubLotus root fries All the flavours are delicious, especially the Buffalo (you could really taste the creamy butter and the tanginess of the vinegar/hot sauce).The Coffee dry rub tasted very unique with a distinctive roasted note and the rub provided an extra level of texture on top of the crispy wings. Lastly the Hoisin honey and sesame tasted the meatiest, as the Hoisin sauce really elevated the umami level in the wing. If you like wings, I highly recommend this place.

Dry.... most of the wings are dry and small.Fries and fried lotus were not bad.Verdict: Maybe my preference is the juicy big fried wings with or without sauce.

I had the greedy option  Shack Stack to try both the beef burger patty as well as the deep-fried Portobello. 0I was wow-ed by the idea of cutting the mushroom in half and filling it with melting cheese, but the practical issue of holding a bun with overflowing cheese sauce in your hand is not that handy!

Central,American,"There has always been a long queue at Shake Shack since its opening last year. In fact, I have been waiting eagerly for its opening for months because my friend who travelled to the States told me that it is her favourite burger chain. Yet, the long queue had stopped me from visiting the restaurant. Finally, the craze is almost over and I could try the burger and fries! Even the queue was much shorter, we still needed to line up for around 20 minutes. After eating the burger and fries, I think the wait is totally worth it!Shack Burger (single), SmokeShack (single), Fries, Fifty/Fifty & Milk Tea Shake...$ 2050Shack Burger (single), SmokeShack (single), Fries, Fifty/Fifty & Milk Tea Shake...$ 205We tried two different burgersShack Burger (single) and SmokeShack (single), fries, Fifty/Fifty and Milk Tea Shake. The burgers were as mouth-watering as expected. Shack Burger was a classic cheeseburger with lettuce and tomato. The combination was simple yet delicious enough. Soft buns with juicy beef patty and melting cheese, my tummy was fully satisfied! For SmokeShack, the all-natural smoked Niman Ranch bacon was so crispy! At the same time, the spicy chopped cherry pepper and ShackSauce helped to lighten the fatty taste of the burger, so we enjoyed eating it! The golden brown fries were a perfect match with the burgers. I like the fact that the fries were quite thick, so apart from the crispy outside, you can taste the starch inside. For the drinks, we like Fifty/Fifty which was half lemonade and half organic iced tea. There was a good balance between the sour lemonade and the bitter iced tea. It was a refreshing drink to go with the fattening burgers and fries. However, we were a bit disappointed with the Milk Tea Shake as it was too sweet and the scent of tea was not strong enough.Overall, we were quite satisfied with our cheat meal at Shake Shack, especially for the fattening burgers. With its affordable price, we will definitely visit it again!",Shake Shack,nan,100,20,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-shake-shack/568104?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw
Central,American,"Comments looked pretty good on openrice with quite a number of signature dishes. I had reserved a table for 2 a few days ago via openrice, with quite some expectations.On the day of our visit, it was pretty full. We were sent to 1/F (I didn't know there were 2 floors for this restaurant).The first impression was quite bad, as the waiter (the only waiter) wore a black face all the time. The waiter showed us to a table so close to the wall that we had to move the table out ourselves to get seated. We also asked the waiter something about the menu but he didn't really give any answers. We asked for serving us the fries without salt but it was discouraged as he said it was going to take very long.Anyway, here you go the lunch menu.Lunch Menu2Lunch MenuWe ordered 2 sets with a starter + main + drink + dessert with something different to try.Beef Barley Vegetable Soup 0Beef Barley Vegetable Soup Beef Barley Vegetable SoupWe asked the waiter what this soup was about before our orders and there was no response.

The portion looked so small to be justified by the cost of $208+10% honestly! The sea urchin was fresh and delicious and big! I think I had hardly seen sea urchin as big as this. But that was it. It seemed that the sauce of the carbonara wasn't from sea urchin but just seafood. The pasta itself was ok, al dente but there was too much black pepper. There seemed to be some crispy bacon all over too.

The ciabatta bread was so crispy, maybe one of the best I had ever had! The USDA prime rib was great, cooked pretty good being tender and juicy! With the extra crispy onion and Raclette cheese the whole thing was juicy enough. I suspected that it could have been too dry without these extras. Maybe which was why the soup was there for dipping. The soup was from beef broth and was ok too. The crispy onions were plentiful and tasty. The Raclette Cheese was delicious and not too salty as at 5019 Premium Factory last time. I could taste some mild portion of mustard in the sandwich. If there were more custard, it could have been even better. Definitely one of the best sandwiches I had never had!New York Cheesecake$ 500New York Cheesecake$ 50New York CheesecakeThe meal was for celebration. It was really appreciated they did decorate the plate for us as requested - thanks to the chef. However, the cheesecake was very so-so. The cheese was thick and hard.

But given the top-up cost of $45+10%, it was ok.Apple Crumble with Vanilla Ice Cream $ 500Apple Crumble with Vanilla Ice Cream $ 50Apple Crumble with Vanilla Ice CreamThis one was much better. The apple crumble was super hot with a lot of apples. The crumbles on top were also great. The vanilla ice cream went well with the crumbles. But the waiter just gave us one spoon each which was very hard to finish the desserts yet we dare not ask for a fork anymore....Overall, the signature Prime Rib sandwich was really great! A must-try dish indeed. The apple crumble with vanilla ice cream was pretty good too. I would say most of the cost of the meal went to the food itself rather than the service, environment or seating.

It makes you think ... can this place really give me a good burger? There are many times I wanted to give this place a try but boyfriend said can you really believe a good burger would come from a place with so many gimmicks?I nodded. He's probably right.Then I saw a blog mention that they were giving away a free cheeseburger one weekend. I showed boyfriend. And we headed out for lunch!The promotion was to test out their new and improved cheeseburger. What the old one tasted, I have no idea. But this was the new and improved version. It was for dine in only so we sat down. Glad we arrived early as it started to fill up with people wanting a free burger. Menu is in English only.0We ordered the two cheeseburgers ($98 but it was free for the promotion) and shared a set of onion rings ($38). The cheeseburger was pretty good. It wasn't great as a higher end burger but for a fast food style burger, it was pretty good. It checked off all the boxes. A decent patty that was a bit dry but filled in with the sauce it was slathered with. A crunchy bit of onion and a slice of processed cheese. A good fast food burger. But for the price tag of $98, one shouldn't be happy with a fast food burger. But it wasn't terrible and would tempt me to return again. The onion rings were over fried and way too much coating. I've had better onion rings elsewhere. But the price wasn't fairly reasonable.0I saw they had a Halloween milkshake and since I love to try as many Halloween related items as possible, I ordered this. It costs $78. When I asked the waiter what was in it, he seemed a bit vague. He said there was cake and nerds, eye and tongue. When it arrived, it looked like something a pre-school art project. The eyes and teeth were hard gummy candies. The tongue was a long sour gummy. The milkshake was probably one of the worst I've had. It was just blended cream. It was just watery and not thick at all. I don't think they used ice cream? There were a mouthful of nerd but where was the cake? For $78, this is definitely not worth your time.

Central,American,"For the sense of completion, I went to Pacific Coffee Caf for coffee after lunch.PCC still provides mug for guests instead of paper cup. Not only does this contribute to environment protection, but also conveys a better feeling of relaxation unlike take-away cups.It is a great surprise that PCC makes the effort to make a latte art for their customers even though its high volume peak hour.The coffee of PCC is somehow sweeter than Starbucks ones, maybe because of different brand of milk used. All in all, coffee is like a chemistry between coffee beans, milk and the barista. The coffee portion is very ideal and very good bargain.~Latte - with hearty latte art ^-^0Latte - with hearty latte art ^-^",Pacific Coffee Company,4.3,40,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-pacific-coffee-company/30715?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

It was not so full even on a week day so that walk-in was also fine if you are not in a big group.Lunch menu1Lunch menuThere were quite a lot of choices from their lunch menu.Bread & butter0Bread & butterA bread basket with butter was served shortly after we were seated. The bread seemed to be freshly baked and was kept pretty warm. They had very crispy crust and soft interior which were really great. The only complaint was that there were only 2 pieces of bread of different kinds which was so not generous and a bit hard to share.Tuna Tartare, spicy mayonnaise, 63C egg, focaccia0Tuna Tartare, spicy mayonnaise, 63C egg, focacciaThe presentation was pretty pleasant. I was a bit surprised that avocado and baby spinach were also served, which were both very fresh. The tuna tartare was quite good, slightly spicy which was quite appetizing. The egg yolk of the 63 degrees egg could have been softer though. The focaccia was very crispy and yummy! It was overall quite a good starter.Beef carpaccio, truffle mayonnaise, rocket0Beef carpaccio, truffle mayonnaise, rocketThe beef carpaccio was equally good. The texture of the beef carpaccio was quite nice, not too rough. I particularly liked the truffle mayonnaise and the cheese which added a lot of flavour to the relatively dry beef carpaccio. The rocket was fresh too. Again, it was quite a good starter overall.Bread0BreadWe asked for more bread, although service was quite slow so we had to ask 3 times for the bread basket to come again. I was surprised that a French baguette was served this time. The bread was freshly baked, which probably explained why it took a while for them to come.Mixed Berry Smoothie$ 770Mixed Berry Smoothie$ 77We added $70+10% for a smoothie each.

We asked for medium rare striploin. However, it seemed that it was medium instead of medium rare. The striploin was quite disappointing as it lacked strong beef flavour. Texture-wise, it wasn't so tender either. It was also quite inconsiderate for the sweet corn to be served like this which was so hard to eat. The mushrooms and artichoke puree were ok but couldn't save this dish. At a price of $298+10%, I had expected much better striploin.Mussels with frites, confit shallots, garlic cheese toast, herbed white wine cream (1.5 lbs)...0Mussels with frites, confit shallots, garlic cheese toast, herbed white wine cream (1.5 lbs)...Mussels0MusselsThis one was better as the mussels were pretty fresh and tender. Portion of the mussels seemed to be quite a lot too. The herbed white wine cream was ok. Overall, it still couldn't beat the really superb mussels @ Belgium Frites on Tap. I would love to give this dish a rating higher than 3 but the frites were so bad that they were even worse than those served at McDonald's - they were way too stiff...The garlic cheese toast was quite good.Tiramisu0TiramisuA daily dessert came with the lunch set and it was Tiramisu for the day. The Tiramisu was so tiny but what should you expect from a complimentary dessert? It was very strong in coffee of which I wasn't a big fan of. It was a bit dry and the cream on the side did help a bit.Iced lemon tea & hot lemon water0Iced lemon tea & hot lemon waterCoffee or tea was included in the lunch set. We just ordered the very standard iced lemon tea and hot lemon water which were nothing special.Overall, the bread and starters were surprisingly good but the striploin and the frites were surprisingly disappointing.

Central,American,"On this wintry Sunday morning, a sudden spur of excitement motivated us to revisit Shake Shack for the second time.  While we were on our way to the restaurant, we were making back up plans if the line up was too long.Surprisingly, they have newly integrated a special line up called the ""C-Line."" It is an express line for ordering beverages, such as, beer and milkshakes. In addition, this line also serves as a special line for any ladies who are pregnant. As my wife is pregnant, we get to order right away. Anyhow, based on my observations today. the ordering line is much shorter than before. The line up did not go all the way to the patio.Today I have tried another milkshake from their menu. It is their Hong Kong Special, Milktea Milkshake. It taste great, but I find it a bit too sweet. The burger I had today is, once again, the Smoke Burger, while my wife had the regular Shack Burger. However, they do not taste as good as the ones I hadon the very first time. The burger was oily.  Really oily indeed.  The bread is soaked, the paper wrapping is obviously saturated with oil.

Central,American,"Today, I went to Shake Shack. When I first stepped into the place, there was a kind of roomy but fun feeling in the air, mostly because it was a nice environment and music was playing. To my surprise, there was a long line of people, even leading to outside the restaurant. When I stepped outside, there were chairs and tables with built in umbrellas. It was a really nice roof atmosphere. I noticed a lot of parties of friends and a few couples scattered around. When I stepped in line, I noticed that there was a nice view of the Victoria Harbor. It was beautiful. I now understood why so many people wanted to sit outside. While I was waiting in line, a Shake Shack person came up to us(people in the line) and handed out these laminated paper menus. Looking on the menu, a food item caught my eye: the Shack Burger. I ordered two for takeout and they handed me a remote buzzer so that I would know when it was ready to pick up. Astonishingly, it was done in a matter of minutes, which was impressive because they had a non-stop flow of people ordering and taking. Once I got my burgers, I left(sadly) and went home.Once I bit into the burger, I tasted the beef patty. It was juicy and succulent, and it went well with the cheese. Also, the tomato and lettuce was quite fresh and went well with the Shake Shack Sauce. The bun was quite soft but toasted with butter to perfection. I think for about 2 minutes of eating the entire burger I just went into food heaven.I recommend going to Shake Shack and trying out their Shack Burger, as it is the best burger I have ever tasted. The food is great, as is the atmosphere, and I would recommend going here with some friends as it is a great place to eat and talk.View from outdoor seatsVictoria Harbor0View from outdoor seatsVictoria HarborShack Burger - Shack Burger.

If you are a little luckier, you can get window bar seats - but ladies have to be aware of their dresses.Food:My friends and I shared two rolls - lobster and crab - which the fillings were wrapped with the same type of bread.

Topped above the crispy warm bun was the creamy and juicy crab melt. To me, it was more like a salad mixture without vegetable.

So it is also a good place for hipster colleagues gathering.Verdict:For first timers, just grab a friend with you and share two buns of two favours so that you will know what you like.

Didn't feel like going back to work immediately so I decided to take the morning off and head over to IFC.1I have been itching to check out Shake Shack, the famous burger joint imported from New York City which has just opened in the IFC rooftop garden for 3 days. I got here at around 11AM (which is the opening time of the restaurant) but only to find around 60 people ahead of me. I guess some of us have really early lunch hours.0I was handed a copy of the menu as soon as I reached the top half of the queue. The only Shake Shack I've visited was the one at Dubai Airport so I won't say I knew their food menu inside out.2Turned out they only have 6 types of burgers and NO set.1After waiting for an hour and a half, it was finally my turn!

I really enjoy well branded environments and thought the interior here was quite well done; I felt like I was in a sort of old-school train car diner. There was this cool lunch combo that was displayed on their window that comes with a burger, fries and a drink, so I decided to go with that and get a fish fillet for my takeaway lunch. The staff were really nice and paid me attention as soon as they were available, and despite the number of customers there at the time, my food was ready quite quickly. This may be the best fish fillet burger I have eaten and the cola they serve is I think a house-made version, which I thought was quite amazing. I'm definitely going back to try their other offerings and I'd love to eat-in next time.Supplementary InformationFood travels quite well in their takeaway bag.

Central,American,"My flatmate and I ordered Burger Circus delivery for a particularly lazy Sunday in. The burgers are honestly the best I've had in Hong Kong, perhaps ever. I'm not a burger person usually, but we had the Fish Fillet (LIFE. CHANGING.) and the Maytag Blue, which was awesome too. Fries arrived hot and crispy and the housemade sodas top it off nicely - get the passionfruit! Our eyes may have been bigger than our stomachs but we just had to get the jalapeno poppers, too, and holy cow we were glad we did. I could eat these by the bucketful.Have eaten in many a time too, super cute retro-ey decor and you can create your own shake! Also they did an AMAZING pumpkin pie around Thanksgiving time, and as a true blue American it's not often you find one of these bad boys to rival Grandma's.

Central,American,"Finally tried Burger Circus in SoHo. I have always thought it looked super cute and I am glad I stopped in. It feels like real American diner with the old timey dcor and classic menu. The team was so nice (shout out to Ali!) and wore cool retro uniforms. The space is bright, fun and comfortable. It also has some fun branding with bright pink which made it feel more current and is also great for taking photos. They also played some cool music.I got the fish filet combo with an Arnold Palmer. The fish was crispy and I liked the tartar sauce. The bun was the perfect amount of squishy. The fries were a big portion so I had a hard time finishing them all, but they were perfect. My friend got the Maytag burger and onion rings with a chocolate milkshake. The shake was in an old-school glass and had whipped cream on top with a cherry. We then shared a slice of apple pie because my friend was dying to try it. It felt like we were back in the 1950s.Overall, Burger Circus was good value for the money.I will definitely be going back and recommending to my American friends.Supplementary InformationIt's in a central area, so good for a rest stop while you're out shopping.

Central,American,"Bagels are pretty rare in Hong Kong. Well, good ones anyways. First there was R&R Bagels which gave me hope in the world of bagels in Hong Kong. Now there is another. Bagel Alley.You may miss it when you walk by as it's located near the Midlevel Elevators. The shop is tucked inside an alley. Seriously. An alley. It's not very big but they have limited indoor and outdoor seating.0Menu is in English and Chinese. They have various types of bagel sandwiches.0They also have something called a bagel pizza?0And various drinks. You can get a minor discount with a drink if you order a bagel.0So, I ordered the Pastrami Bomb ($70) and added $20 for a sweet lychee rose tea. The tea was fairly sweet indeed and no sugar was added. It was a whole tea bag and smelled nice as well. But I wasn't here for tea. I wanted a bagel.The Pastrami Bomb included pastrami, mustard, gherkin, tomato, Swiss cheese, rocket lettuce and cream cheese. You can choose any bagel variety that they have available. I chose sun dried tomato. The bagel was pretty good. A nie dense texture. It was also toasted and I loved how they wrapped it in paper and sliced it half for easier handling. The pastrami was great and went well with the sharp gherkin. The cream cheese was smooth and balanced out the strong Swiss. A fairly well built sandwich.0A lot cheaper than R&R Bagel and just as good. The bagels were good and I like their combinations.

However, despite coming here many times, this one left me and my friend (and the other patrons near me) with a bitter taste. A 2 inch long cockroach in the attached picture thought the same about the food and proceeded to crawl up my leg towards my crotch. Luckily a patron sitting on the table next to me warned me. I quickly ran away from my table and used a coaster to swat the 2 inch cockroach away from my groin and onto the floor. I quickly yelled for the waitress to deal with it and told her it was ridiculous! I later on told your staff i did not want to pay for my meal after being violated by our mini-weinstein esque friend. However, staff bluntly told me they cannot control how little critters enter their establishment from outside and as such it was not their fault. Coming from Australia and with the family having owned restaurants in Sydney, it was not the response I was accustomed to nor the response I was certainly testing for! If i were to review service and attitude, it would actually be no stars as that waiter - he got a bit agro towards me for even suggesting I not pay...Anyway, me and my friend still paid for our meal (the cost of the meal is never the issue in circumstances like these) and sure have a story to tell for keepsakes!

I must say the deep fried chicken was so nicely done (although I usually don't really like deep fried chicken). The meat was so smooth while being excitingly and juicy! The pulled pork one was alright.0The Open Sandwich was GREAT for avocado fans like myself. It was presented in a way very similar to the avocado toast available in many brunch places.

Central,American,"My family and I usually prefer dinner buffet to lunch buffet as we tend to eat more for dinner and less for lunch.Yet, attracted by the offer of HKD 338 for a 3-hour buffet, we decided to go for it.We went to the brunch buffet at Mamasitas to celebrate my brothers birthday, who likes to try new stuff.It was a bit disappointing to realize on spot that we could only choose one for the main course.Food options like seafood paella, omelette, tacos could be ordered unlimitedly and they would be cooked fresh to guarantee the quality of the food.Taco0TacoAmongst the three taco offers (Pork Carnitas, Fish Taco and Milpa Taco), I like Pork Carnitas best.Not only because of its meaty content, but the sensations of flavour and textural balance brought by the mingling of sweet and sour green tomatillos, pineapple jam and the tints of crispiness and crunchiness brought by the pork crackling and pork confit.I seldom see pork crackling in restaurants nowadays as people tend to equate it with fat and grease.I was told that recent researches show that pork fat is actually good for human health, I am dubious about that but I was still undeniably pleased by this news.Omelette0OmeletteThe omelette looks just like an ordinary omelette except that it was covered with guacamole sauce.The omelette itself was a bit plain, but since it was freshly made, there was still egg sauce flowing out as I cut it gently with my fork, it tastes wonderfully appetizing when mixed with the guacamole.Rib Eye Steak0Rib Eye SteakChile Rubbed Beef Brisket0Chile Rubbed Beef BrisketAs meat lovers, my brother chose the Rib Eye Steak while I chose Chile Rubbed Beef Brisket for our main courses.Both of them are beef, and when they come to table, we were surprised to see the Chile Rubbed Beef Brisket looking very alike with the steak!The beef brisket looks a bit too red and we asked the staff there to see if thats normal.We were satisfied to know that since the beef was slow-cooked, its color would be redder than usual.Both portions are quite large, and we were a bit worried if we could not finish the food.We tried the Rib Eye Steak first, it was sliced evenly and each piece could be finished within two to three bites.It was grilled well, scorching the surface without destroying the tenderness of the meat, producing an aroma that one would never get fed up of.The steak was juicy enough without the sauce.As the taste has turned duller inside our mouths, we tried to dip the puree and black mole butter.The flavour becomes appetizing instantly and we finish the entire rib eye steak within five minutes.As we started the Chile Rubbed Beef Brisket, we were happy to find it still warm.We started to believe that the food are cooked after we placed our order, unlike some restaurants which have all food items kept warm in the kitchen and serve them only when they feel the customers are ready.The beef brisket was extremely tender and soft, I never had slow-cooked beef brisket before and I couldnt make comparison.But as beef brisket, it could be renowned as the best beef brisket that I have ever tried.It was so smooth yet did not lose any tints of beef aroma and texture.I could feel that I was eating beef brisket and yet at the same time had the sensation of eating perfectly roasted spring chicken.We were extremely full after the main courses and could not fulfill our goal of eating all the food items offered on the buffet table at least once.We only tried the churro balls and decided that we would rather prefer churro sticks.There was nothing to do with the flavour, but churro balls just dont feel as satisfying as sticks.It was an amazing experience and I look forward to visiting it again!",Mamasita's Cantina,nan,338,nan,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-mamasitas-cantina/495872?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

Central,American,Ordered their 16oz Beef Short Ribs and it was really really good (and also very fatty) @ $568. Full of flavours and was good enough to eat it w/o the BBQ sauce. Their slow cook prime beef sandwich (au jus) was pretty good too. Love the horse radish spread on the Ciabatta bread. Gives a good kick...however I do I wished there were more beef inside coz I dun feel full at all eating that @ $148. One of my fave was their Crab Cake appetizer @ $188 (!!!) it was a big portion and you can really taste quality meat in there but wished they could have more tar tar sauce considering the crab cake is pretty big. Their Michael Mondavi wine cost $570 which I think is quite over priced but it was better than ordering their wine per glass which cost $108 - $118.Overall a good dining experience but too costly for causal afternoon lunch.,Westwood Carvery,4.6,900,nan,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-westwood-carvery/47057?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

Central,American,"I didn't have breakfast and was looking forward to an early lunch before my meeting.Got there about 11:30am there were a few ""suits"" sitting at the bar watching NBA and drinking beer, and another couple sitting at a table eating. All seems well as I ordered the classic pastrami with fries and a side order of creamy coleslaw.The wait was short as it was ready for pick up in 5 minutes. As it was a sunny and warm day I thought I would eat outside by the fountain. Everything looked right when I opened the box and was looking forward to my first bite...Well the brisket was too salty and heavily seasoned. Also the brisket was cut wafer thin and it was all pre sliced in a big metal dish which I saw at their preparation area. It wasn't even busy then and they couldn't be bother to slice it fresh on order.Back to the brisket, my mouth could only taste of saltiness as there was no beef flavour at all! I was so tempted to throw the sandwich away but did not have time to buy another lunch before my meeting so I tried to keep going... The fries were hot but it was too tough and had no crunchiness on them whatsoever. I took a couple more and gave up the rest The sandwich I managed to finish but regretted it afterwards as I was so thirsty and drank almost a litre of water.The only decent thing about the meal was the coleslaw, the vegetables were crunchy and the dressing was just right.If that is the quality they consistently served how on earth do they manage to stay in business?

We were quickly presented with a menu whose quality resembles something you would hand out on the streets for marketing purposes. It's like a self serve place where u go up to the counter, order and pay first. My friend and I opted for the half combo of short rib. We were given the option of pretzel bun, a kind of wrap or rice. We opted for the first. The combo also comes with a side and a drink. We got nachos and beetroot fries. For drinks, there was no list on the menu and the lady at the counter listed out the options when asked at a very rapid pace. We went for the iced lemon tea. 0The food was surprisingly very small in portion for the price paid ($108 each).

The salmon was an uninspiring smoked salmon salad with a light marinade. The dried tomatoes that came with it were the best part of the dish. The tuna was a more interesting marinated tuna tartar with poached egg, avocado, spinach and a hint of horseradish or wasbi. It tasted quite good but when the tartar was mixed with the spinach it looked like a mess.Our mains were the wagyu brisket and chicken breast. The brisket was horrible - the thoughest piece of meat that I have been served at a restaurant and definately not brisket. When cut, juices poured out of the beef. It clearly not been rested before serving yet still managed to be lukewarm at best.

Central,American,"There is something about lobster that makes me stop in my tracks. And lobster rolls is pretty much a quick fix for those days when you can't do a little full blown lobster dinner. It seems to be the ""It"" food of the moment. I mean, if you go to Canada, the east coast McD's has McLobster. That's how trendy it's become when McDonald's gets in on the game.Lobster rolls originated in the east coast of USA, most notably New England. They are traditionally served in a hotdog bun that is sliced down the top, all buttered up. Served with a side of fries or potato chips. It's the ultimate street food. Once you have one, you dream of having another.There are a few places in Hong Kong that serve lobster rolls: Master Kama, Pop It, Mama Burger & Lobster ... just to name a few. The latest to enter this world is Lobster Central. A small shop located in ... yes, as the name states, Central.Menu is in English only. There is no 10% service charge. You pay (cash only) at the cashier and wait for your order to be brought to you. They serve not only lobster rolls but also crab rolls and shrimp rolls. Fries are not part of the package but you can order it as a side. They do have a combo set that includes a lobster bisque and half a roll for $150.I, however, wasn't keen on eating HALF a lobster roll. No way! I was here to gorge on the whole thing! No weak halves for me.One lobster roll. Price? $138. Size? Not big. But it was enough for me to at least be not too full to have a little dessert elsewhere later. This was fairly good lobster roll. The bun was buttered. Actually, the whole lobster tasted buttery and glorious. I appreciated that the whole bun was filled with lobster meat and nothing else. No strange addition of salad bits (like Coffee Alley did). It was just biting into lobster meat and a buttered bun. I read past reviews where people found cartilage in theirs. I didn't find that in mine. Perhaps they read reviews and have improved on this by removing the cartliage.1Pretty good lobster roll. Best in town? Well ... will be going through the rest of my list to find out if it is. But for the mean time, not bad at all.

We also got a side of orange juice and iced tea to rehydrate our hungover bodiesFood (Overall 8/10)Cant really go wrong when you put so many good things in one pan, sprinkle it with cheese and grill/saute it. But the skillet was so much more, the steak was beautifully cooked to the point it melted in the mouth, the onions in the skillet were grilled and provided a tangy/sweet relief from the carb overdose. The eggs itself were nicely cooked with the beautifully oozing yolks - I swear the number of times I have been disappointed with overdone poached eggs at reputable places is very high, thankfully this was not one of those places. The skillet was sprinkled with some paprika. On mixing, the yolk and the melted cheese combined nicely with the potatoes to create the perfect hangover cure. I'd rate this a 8/10Service (9/10)The servers were very courteous and did not need to be told to refill our water glasses. The timing of the food itself was also good, and it took only about 10-15 minutes for the skillets to arrive.

I'm not sure whether this is the first time McDonald's has offered a grilled rice burger on its menu, but if we take into account what we'd expect to get for around $30 at a fast food chain, it wasn't all that bad! I liked that the egg was fried with sweet corn and that the rice was speckled with seaweed. If only the chicken patty wasn't all that mushy (barely able to detect meat) and the fried egg not so salty and greasy, this would be a rather fun treat. For those interested in portion size, the burger was relatively small with pretty tiny rice buns. I'd say without sides and drinks, this wouldn't cut it as a proper meal, even for girls.I also tried the new McFlurry in the series with bits of oreo and caramel sauce.

The restaurant is quite small, but it's quite easy to find with its neon pink and green sign.1I knew I wanted to try the portobello mushroom after reading the magazine article, but that's not quite enough for lunch, so I decided to try the Special Salad Combo as well. So, I placed my order at the counter and picked out 3 choices from the salad showcase up front.111After taking my order, the server asked me to take a seat while they prepared my order.

The purple sweet potato was delightful; it had the natural sweetness of the sweet potato and pumpkin, and the apple pieces gave it a light acidity. The kale salad came with a dressing on the side, which was a light vinaigrette.

Since I like spicy food, I have ordered this Korean style portobello. It was not too overly spicy nor sweet. The portobello was baked with a few slices of chicken, topped with some kimchi and cheese on top and broiled it until golden.The portobello was fresh and very juicy. The big mushroom was seasoned lightly. Even with all the toppings on top. The savouriness just balanced out with the earthy taste from one of my favourite types of mushroom.

The place is cozy, quiet and a bit private.I ordered the prime rib sandwich set lunch ($128) with soup (cream of mushroom) & drinks (fresh lemonade). The cream of mushroom was just decent, I could taste the bits of mushroom floating around in this soup, and the texture wasn't the very creamy type.Cream of mushroom0Cream of mushroomThe anticipated prime rib sandwich with crispy onion was up to my expectation, just simply dipped the sandwich into the liquidy gravy, and it added so much flavour to the ribs!

Central,American,"I was in Sheung Wan for some errands and was looking for a quick lunch before heading to work before peak lunch hour comes around. I walked down this side alley area that had a number of restaurants to see what was interesting.Selfit Salad Station serves DIY salads and sandwiches. It's a small shop with limited seating. It seemed to be geared for take away.0They had a lunch menu that changes weekly that consists of pasta and comes with a drink with an optional soup or yogurt upgrade. Sounded healthy and quick enough, I decided to eat here.0Ordered the Italian spicy tomato sauce with prawn pasta for $68. Pastas are made to order so I waited a while for them to make it. It was piping hot when it arrived. The pasta was not very spicy with a decent tomato sauce. Pasta was not overcooked though not al dente. The prawns were actually the best. Fresh and firm. I liked the prawns a lot.0Lunch comes with a drink but for ice drinks, there is an additional $4. I asked for an ice lemon tea. This came in the cutest mug ever.0As I didn't want soup, I ordered a salad. Salads are $48 and you can choose up to three choices from their display. I chose a sweet potato and pumpkin salad and tomato prawn salad with pesto. I actually liked the salad a lot more than the pasta. The potato and pumpkins were nice and creamy, just the way I like potatoes. The combination made for one sweet tasting salad. I found this was tossed with some raisins. Love raisins so this was a good combination for me. The tomato prawn salad with pesto tasted very fresh. There was a generous serving of pesto. I found lovely chunks of feta cheese.0A decent little shop for salads and sandwhiches.

Restaurant is mainly catered for takeaway (there are around 5 chairs that face the wall) and located a bit south of the main Soho area. Once you enter, the menu is pretty simplechoose rice (brown or white) and/or greens, the type of dressing you want on the greens if ordered, and the type of tuna you want (note that not all the types of tuna on the menu are available everyday). I opted for half brown rice and half salad with sesame dressing and for tuna, I chose spicy spicy and thai flavours (it costs a bit more if you choose more than one type of tuna). Total for the bowl was 90 bucks which is a bit expensive but to be honest, it is pretty hard to find healthy food available in Hong Kong. Portions are just right hereand in regards to the taste, the salad dressing was pretty good and the tuna was marinated perfectly, although I was slightly disappointed that the spicy spicy flavour was not spicy at all.

Central,American,"0I love that you can be wandering around a part of town that you thought you knew well, but realised that you didn't. I had this feeling when walking down Stanley Street in Central a couple of weeks ago, where I noticed a new little 'hole-in-the-wall' restaurant that was right up my alley.I'd developed a real taste for lobster rolls when visiting New York a few years back (see post here) and have been lowly tracking down all of the dining spots that have lobster rolls on their menus. You can imagine my surprise and delight when I stumbled across a spot that specialised in lobster rolls!Deciding that I'd check it out for lunch one day, I made a beeline for Lobster Central and discovered that the little hole-in-the-wall spot was a lot bigger than I'd first noticed. There was room for about twenty or so diners to sit down and enjoy the simple joy of a lobster roll.The menu at Lobster Central is pretty short and to the point, which is really what the team are trying to achieve, with a view to stripping down the roll to it's 'most naked form'. What does that mean you might ask? Well, it means that the lobster rolls at Lobster Central are stripped down and dressed minimally - there is a brioche bread roll, lobster and a light coating of a house made lemon butter with a secret spice mix. No fancy salad and a generous amount of lobster.0While the humble lobster roll is the key focus of Lobster Central, there are a couple of other options available should you not (shock horror) like lobster rolls. There's also a crab roll and a shrimp roll available, but really, if you're not into lobster rolls, then you're probably going to avoid a place that's sole purpose for existing is producing the 'quintessential' lobster roll experience. There's also a couple of sides available, such as lobster bisque, slaw and truffle fries, and for the adventurous diners, there are combo deals that include a mix'n match of different rolls.I'd timed my visit to Lobster Central perfectly, arriving about ten minutes prior to a rush that saw a line out the door, so I had a comfy seat right at the front that let me do a little people watching as I waited for my meal to arrive. My choice for the day? Well, it would be no surprise that I'd gone for the lobster roll, the lobster bisque and some of the truffle fries. But what did I think?Let's start off with the good. For lobster roll purists, there's plenty for you to love about Lobster Central, with plenty of delicious lobster meat stuffed into a light brioche roll. The light drizzle of lemon butter was perfect with the sweet flesh of the lobster, and the secret seasoning was interesting. From a sizing perspective, the lobster rolls are reasonably small, so you could easily go for two of them if you were feeling particularly hungry.00The truffle fries were also very good, although thin cut in style, the fries were cooked well and had a golden crunchy outer. I could smell the truffle salt on the fries but the taste was quite subdued and mild, so I'd have preferred a little punchier hit of truffle.0Now, the bad. I'd ordered the lobster bisque and it was far from what I'd consider to be an acceptable bisque, and in fact, about the only thing that was right about it was it's deep red colouring. I found the bisque to be really thin and watered down, with a flavour that was not far off inedible. It came out so hot that I couldn't really try it until after I'd finished my lobster roll and fries. When I could finally have a sip, I almost spat it out. 1The other element that was disappointing was the cartilage that was still in the lobster in my roll, and not just one piece of cartilage or shell, but numerous. It actually detracted from what would have otherwise been the 'perfect' lobster roll - by that I mean most like the great lobster rolls I was devouring all over Manhattan. Removing the shell and cartilage from the lobster is the basic tenant of serving a lobster roll and has to be right - every.single.time!Lobster Central is a funky little spot that's decked out semi industrial and with room for about twenty diners at a time. Most of the seats are bench style, but there are a couple of tables set out for groups of four right at the back, so if you're early enough, you could get along with a couple of mates for lunch. I loved the music being played while I was people watching and munching on my lunch, but the speaker was right next to me at the front of the dining area, so I'd love to see the speaker installed in the walls - otherwise it would be hard to have a conversation with your dining companion.I'll definitely get along to Lobster Central as one of my regular lunch time spots, but I will be avoiding the bisque and probably just getting a couple of the lobster rolls. That is, as long as my next visit is fault free! @FoodMeUpScotty0The lobster rolls are not huge1But they are packed full of the good stuff!0I loved this bottle of pure New Zealand volcanic water!0Semi industrial feel with the exposed brick and tube lighting0Bigger than I initially thought, there was room for twenty in the dining area0Worth checking out - Stanley Street",Lobster Central,3.1,300,nan,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-lobster-central/480752?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
Central,American,"A coworker has asked me to come try for lunch, and came to get seats during busy lunch hour before I arrived.Knowing that it will be too evil to have 1 burger all by ourselves, we shared a double patty which means we both get 1 patty but half the bread. I guess that is ""less"" calories in a way. We also ordered the donut bites.The place was very packed when I arrived. If it's a chinese restaurant I am sure I would bump my hand into the person next to me. I think with the way the seats were arranged, I would prefer getting take out next time (I see a lot of people coming and going for take out).The sight of the double decker was really amazing. Cheese, veggies and the beef patties. No way for me to get them all in a bite. The beef was mediumto medium well whichwas alright and the melted cheeseall over the patty was no wonder aphoto catcher. Like the fact that the bunwas toasted and crispy. The sauce in the burger was not very my thing andI had to wipe some sauce off the burger to finish it. Good quality beef patty but the combination of the ingredientswas notspecialenough to""wow"" me.The donut bites arrived when we were half way done with our burger.

The waiter was nice enough to tell me that there is a lunch combo so I can also choose a soda on the menu.Passionfruit pineapple soda was very refreshing, but with too much ice. The burger and fries took a bit of a wait. I liked the cheddar cheese in the burger which is nicely melted. The beef patty was well done but very moist so it's perfect for a preggo woman like me. The sauce was also very good with a tangy flavour - so it'snot just ketchup.

I arrived around 12:40, and it was starting to get crowded, and there was a long line at the register.1One of the special items at Century Square is the affogato. I had the Christmas special drinks on my mind, so I didn't order the affogato.During the holiday season, the Gingerbread Soy Latte is my go-to SB drink in Hong Kong since they don't offer the eggnog latte in HK. So, I ordered the Gingerbread Soy Latte, and since I brought my own tumbler, I received the $3 tumbler discount.Gingerbread Soy Latte$ 421Gingerbread Soy Latte$ 42The GSL had a stronger gingerbread flavor, which overpowered the coffee flavor. In my opinion, these special Christmas beverages are more like dessert drinks. If you like to taste your coffee, this might not be your cup of tea (coffeee)! I ordered the Smoked Salmon Baguette, since this is not offered at the Happy Valley branch. The barista asked if I wanted it heated, which, to me, is a strange request since this is a cold sandwich, and heating it would wilt the vegetables in the sandwich.Smoked Salmon Baguette$ 441Smoked Salmon Baguette$ 44The sandwich was quite filling.

Central,American,"Four of us made a reservation and checked out the Weekend All You Can Eat brunch. Definitely good value for money if youre seriously into seafood but these people would be hung, drawn and quartered for calling this stuff Low Country Boil with bell peppers, onion, celery; The holy trinity. Its like offering Classic French onion soup and serving it with white bread and American cheese on top. Its an insult to the French and they get insulted enough already.Low country boil is a classic Southern American/Cajun stew that BY LAW must have Old Bay seasoning or at least crab boil seasoning, besides the Holy Trinity of vegies. This had none of that; no seasoning and no veggies. Just bland boiled seafood. Very disappointing if you ever had Low Country Boiled seafood ... or had a mother that loved you enough to put salt in the boiling water.Are these the same guys who had Blue Smoke Bar-B-Que that was on the 3rd floor of Grand Progress Building, right next door to Holy Crab? It would seem so as both have no idea what southern cooking is.Now that the main complaint is out of the way, on the rest of the experience.They advertise a choice of crab, shrimp or lobster. On this day, they also had all you can eat clams. So, being 4 of us, we got 1 of each. Plenty to eat except for the guy who ordered the clams. After 2 pails of clams (they are really quite small but its all you can eat so no problem), they announced they were all out. OK, he switched to lobster. And then on the way out, we passed the tanks of seafood, 2 of which were full of clams. WTF? If you want to offer All You Can Eat, then you should have ample supply or at least not cut me off when you have a ready supply. Its just lazy that they keep half for the dinner rush. Running out, ORDER MORE. Its called stock management.Along with the All You Can Eat seafood, you get 2 other courses. First, a choice of biscuits and sausage gravy, Crab benedict or herb cake benedict. All were we well received but I love the heart clogging biscuits and sausage gravy so I ordered it. It arrived while we were deep in conversation and I was 2 bits into it before I realized they served me crab benedict instead. Sh*t, I was really looking forward to the biscuits.2nd course was a fruit salad or Caesar salad. My Caesar salad had almost no dressing at all and was disappointing. I heard the fruit salad was good. Hard to screw it up; cut fruit, put in bowl. Simple.Oddly enough, the highlight of the day was the holy punch. Very nice, little sweet and refreshing. Great for all that seafood. At $180 a jug, its a bit pricy for fruit juice but a worth it to me.Total cost, $2700 for 4 ($675 each) is OK if you can gobble down mass quantities of quality seafood but I would have paid more to get REAL Low Country Boil, or at least not to have been tricked in by their deceitful advertising.I might go back, especially if they offered REAL Low Country Boil but I know what Im going to get. On second hand, I can a get all you can eat seafood anywhere in town with additional choices.

Central,American,"Although I am not in anyway a connoisseur in poke nor Hawaiian cuisine, Pololi which in Hawaiian means ""hungry"" has opened the doors and has lured me into a world of Hawaiian cuisine which I'm eager to explore...With a small but select menu, a poke bowl costing $90 contains a base of either rice (brown or sushi rice), salad or a mixture of both, as well as 2 choices of proteins. When I arrived, I was very uncertain as to what I should order but I was surprised and flattered by the sincere service and help the employees had to offer as they gladly allowed me to try a few pieces of poke so that I could make my decision. In addition, before handing me and my friend the pieces of tuna, she asked if we had any allergies which was very considerate and rare in most Hong Kong restaurants. Eventually, I decided to go with a half and half base with their limu poke and wasabi mayo poke. The limu poke was slightly weaker in flavour compared to the wasabi mayo poke considering the mixture included shoyu and ginger. However, in compensation the slightly crunchy seaweed enhanced the overall texture of the dish. On the other hand, I loved the wasabi mayo poke with just the right amount of heat to stimulate my appetite and within minutes I had finished the bowl and was craving more.Overall, Pololi was a great experience and writing this review makes me pololi all over again.

Central,American,"Went there on a Sat afternoon and selected the brunch with bottomless seafood ($418 + 10%). The seafood selection included tiger prawns, lobster and spider crab legs all cooked in their homemade broth, the holy trinity. First off, the broth was heavily seasoned with black pepper (it was actually way over seasoned) which indicated that the seafood was probably not overly fresh. The amount of pepper would mask the unfreshness of the seafood. Tried the tiger prawn first and the meat was mushy, another indication of unfreshness. The lobster and crab legs were acceptable but lacked flavour on its own. You needed to dip it in the various sauces that the restaurants provides in order for any flavour. To be fair, for the price you pay and bottomless seafood offer I would not expect fresh seafood but I do expect seafood with good flavour. Holy Crab did not provide this, which was disappointing for a restaurant selling itself on the seafood it provides.

My friend took a half portion of the prime rib sandwich lunch set ($128 for a half portion and $168 for a full portion) and I had a grilled cod with vegetables lunch set ($178).The lunch set comes with a drink (either lemonade or coffee) and a choice of soup or salad.

Add to that some hot, crispy fries and you have the perfect meal that will leave you in food coma for the remainder of your afternoon at the office (which was okay considering that we got news during the first half of our meal that Typhoon no.8 was expected to be hoisted shortly).My grilled cod was a very different dish. The cod seemed to have been deep-fried, because not only was it overly crispy on the outside, but oil was dripping down as I cut through the fish at every point. Too much oil and not enough flavor beyond saltiness, unfortunately. The cod also came with a slice of grilled pineapple, half a red pepper and a few spoonfuls of diced onions and potatoes. Oil had been showered over the veggies. Somehow, though, fat satiates, and not in a bad way, because natural fats improve our mood and with food satisfaction happening much sooner, we eat less overall. If the fish was steamed, I might instead have gone for a cake after the meal, which would have made me feel even worse afterwards.The hot coffee (Americano) was slightly on the sour side, but it was freshly brewed and helped my digestion a little bit.Looking around, almost everyone had the half-portion sandwich. Most people ate with their hands, dipping the sandwich into the runny brown sauce and licking their fingers clean at each turn, evidently too absorbed to care about table etiquette. The dining area is extremely small, with a seating capacity of roughly 15-20 indoors, so expect this to be very casual and a bit noisy. Service was decent for a busy lunch hour.Final bill came down to around $340 with a 10% charge.Half portion prime rib sandwich (Lunch set)0Half portion prime rib sandwich (Lunch set)Grilled cod (Lunch set)0Grilled cod (Lunch set)",Westwood Carvery,3.5,170,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-westwood-carvery/47057?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

Central,American,"I saw my friends posted up in their face book when they visited this restaurant last weekend for brunch. Those pictures of they took and posted up was looking very delicous.So I and my two friends decided to go for it as our friends told us it's only $418+ per person and there is no time limits. Hey! We have time on weekend and thats the place that we are looking for. We all knew that Hong Kong brunch nowadays is getting expensive and still they out time limit to it. Forget it! I won't want to eat so fast. Anyway, let's go back to our experience in Holy Crab.There was quite fullwhen we got there around 12:30pm and lucky we got booking.The managergreeted us at the door and escort us to oFish Tank0Fish TankBrunch Menu0Brunch Menuur table. We got bench seating and it's comfortable and spacious. It's 12:30pm and we are very hungry and we could smell theseafoods in the dining area!     We sat down and the manager explained to us the Bottomless SeafoodBrunch Set. We just told her straight that we come for this menu and she gaveus a big smile and say we make the right choice.    . We gotserve complimentary a shot of Virgin Pina Colada before our1st Course is serve. That really freshen upour day!  . We ordered twomug of Holy Punch and looks great and it has fresh pineapple in it. Ok, here start our brunch. Round 1............I choosed Crabs and Meat Benedict and my friend choosed Southern Swimmer Benedict. There is 3 choices in Round 1. Another one is called Southern Love on a plate. ( It's a homemade sausage patties with scrambled eggs on buttermilk biscuits ) We felt it's safer to ordered Benedict. We were told later that if we like to have another plate of benedict is also fine. We just cannot believe it!    .Then Round 2 is like Something Lite........our friends last time ordered their Caesar Madness. So we were thinking to choose Caesar Madness or Southern Living Fresh Fruit Salad. Finally we both selected Caesar Madness. The Caesar Salad comes in decent size and the dressing is perfect blend with Romaine Lettuce. We both enjoyed it indeed.Then the final Round is ..............Bottomless Seafood Bucket........       .....We now get ready to digest our starter and caesar! We started with Jumbo Tiger Prawns Bucket and we got to finish one bucket by bucket. So that fair enough not to waste food.We came here for this and couldn't believe that next is Boston Lobster Bucket and next is Snow Crab Legs Bucket. We kept ordering after buckets and buckets. Thats why they called it Bottomless Seafood.     .From 12:30pm, we ate till 4:00pm and we just cannot moved at all. Hahahahaha! We need wheelchairto get us out. The staff just kept asking us for refill, this is what I called good service. TheBottomless is until 5:00pm but we really cannot eat anymore. We wish we have4 stomach.      . Anyway, we just pay $418+ and we walked our super full and wemaking plan now to get our friends in group fornext weekend gathering.We told our friends who dined here and Thank you for her recommendation to us.

Central,American,"This was my second time here, both times were great weekday lunch experiences indeed!Because this place is quite hidden (at the end of the lane) so there was not much of a wait to get seats. The waiters were friendly and casual, they greeted customers well and were helpful. Food gets ordered at the cashier and the girl at the cashier knew the menu well enough to make recommendations and suggestions for making combos (to save you $). Nice!They have funky burger ingredients like kimchi, bak choi... So both times I ordered ""vintage"" (which is more ""normal""), added $15 for an extra piece of SPAM ham which was proven to be a good decision! The beef was juicy and tender, the cheese melted just right, saltiness was just right, and it doesn't give you the """" after-taste that most burgers have. The problem with adding SPAM was only that the wrapping paper was a bit too small for the thickness and got messy, but taste-wise everything was great! I also ordered Beet Fries, it comes with mayo with cajun, the first time the fries was perfect, very soft, sweet and juicy in the centre and crispy outside!! The second time the fries was slightly too dry because the cut was too small and it got slightly burnt.The only thing I would complain about is the drinks. A can of regular coke costs $25 (!!) without combo, while a can of Arizona Green Tea costs $40 (!!). So probably you will be better off not drinking there if your favourite burger is not the ""combo burger of the day"" (each day only 2 burger/wrap can be part of a combo).I'll definitely be a regular for weekday lunch here but have to sort out the drinks part to lower my lunch expense...

Central,American,"Dragged my lunch buddy to Boomshack for lunch. I have heard about this place through a friend and decided to give this place a try. We didn't have to wait for tables that day, I guess it was because this place wasfairly new. The restaurant is inspired byfast food trucks inthe US and it serves burgers, tacos and fries, some with an Asian twist. You will see their kitchen behind the food truck decor. If you are nosy like me, you can peep inside to see their chefs busily working inside. This place had a lively ambience, probably due to the music, the decorand the young customers enjoying their meals. The cashier and the server were quite unenthusiastic though.I was just there for the fast food, sothe (lack of) servicedidn't bother me, just like you wouldn't expect service at Mc D. Food truck decor0Food truck decorGraphic menu on the wall0Graphic menu on the wallWe sat at the 'normal' seats near the brick wall, instead of the high chairs at the centre. Our food was brought over by the server within 10 minutes. Their portions might looked pretty small, but it was denitely enough to fill the stomaches of two women with a much larger appetite than an average Hong Kong lady. We both picked something from the Boom Burger menu, rather than tacos. I had the Holy Kimchi (HKD$88) and loved it. The corned beef and kimchi pairing was interesting. The beef was succulent andthekimchi was flavourful (not spicy). Cheddar cheese and their 'baconaise' (bacon + mayo?) provided the grease that held the burger together wonderfully. All their bugers were served in potato buns. I assume it was made with potato powder and flour, with texture similar to a focaccia,and it has more air pockets than the usual flour bun, which means it can hold more sauce and juice from the meat! It was a very nice combination. 0Holy Kimchi$ 880Holy Kimchi$ 88My friend had the King Kong (HKD$ 98) which had a beef patty and a spam patty, along with bok choy, provolone and XO sauce mayo. You can smell the bok choy when you opened the box that held the burger. The burger was bursting with juice, and my friend didn't appreciate it as it made a whole mess and her precious engagement ring was soaked in the grubby grease (that was a hilarious scene when she panicked ...). The XO sauce was barely detectable and there were simply too much meat and too little bun. I guess the King Kong would be something for the macho macho man.

Central,American,"I had this major omega-3 craving on a work day so I went to Poloni with a friend during lunch hour.  The place was not difficult to find, its on the slope of Graham Street in Central, slightly above the wet market. Stop when you see bright coloured surf boards at the door.  We were lucky, we got there before the rush hour.  The friendly guy in the store offered a quick poke tasting session to us as first timers (yay!).  We got to try almost all their ahi poke.  Who doesnt like choices?  I think we tried 5 to 6 kinds of tuna.  The tuna chunks came in decent size  they were substantial enough yet not too big that you had to bite it in half. They had quite a broad spectrum of ahi pokes  from rich, creamy ones to lighter, soya sauce-based ones. The creamy choices: (1) Asian Creamy Ahi. This one had avocado chunks in it. To be honest, I only ordered this one because I wanted avocado. Otherwise, it tasted bland. A little but of salt would definitely help.  (2) Wasabi Mayo Ahi. This had a very faint hint of wasabi. I was expecting a kick from the wasabi but it wasnt there. (3) Spicy Mayo Ahi. As you can guess from the name, it was spicy and it has mayo. That was pretty much it.The lighter options: (4) Ginger Shoyu Ahi. I liked this one. The tuna chunks were coated with ginger bits and marinated in shoyu. The ginger was not too overpowering and the shoyu sauce provided the saltiness to bring the poke together. (5) Hong Kong Style Ahi. This was an interesting one. It tasted like curry fishballs on the streets, but with the texture of raw fish! (6) Thai Style Ahi. This had a distinct taste. There was marinated in lemon grass. I am not sure if I like tuna with lemon grass though. You can have your poke on rice (white or brown) or salad or a mix of both. My friend and I both picked rice as neither of us ate like the typical Hong Kong girl. We can eat a lot. Yet we couldnt finish the poke bowl as they gave you very generous portion here. I kind of got bored of it half way. The rice was warm (its not sushi rice) but it was quite dry with the ahi poke. I wished they use the soya sauce they put in the Spam Masubi rice in the poke bowls as the moist maker. Speaking of which, the Spam Masubi was good! They warmed the Masubis in the food incubator. I am not a fan of spams so I guess it was not particularly memorable to me. A visit to Poloni was a nice experience. The place was lively and cheerful and the novelty of Hawaiian ahi poke could not be found anywhere else in Hong Kong. 0",Pololi,3.6,100,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-pololi/184250?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
Central,American,"I went to Burger Circus after seeing photos of it on a HK restaurant instagram. It was just as good as I had expected! The restaurant was really easy to get to (close to Queens Road Central) so it only took us a few minutes to walk there. It was about 1.15pm but luckily there was no queue so we were seated right away. We had to share a table with a couple but it was fine, as the table was big enough that it wasn't awkward and we could still have a private conversation. The decor of the restaurant was great- they had little diner like booths to sit in, a bar seating ares, and candy in jars lining the bar- it was very well done. Our waiter was very polite and came to us quickly so we didn't have to wait for very long, and was very helpful in advising us on which sodas and burgers were better suited for us. I ordered an Ameican Acrobat burger (5oz beef patty, lettuce, tomato, cheese, and Mayo) with thick cut fries and a Passion fruit Pineapple soda (homemade!) and my friend got the Flame Thrower Burger. They came quite quickly and were delicious. The burger wasn't too greasy but was very juicy and well seasoned. The fried were great as well, and there was ketchup available to use on every table. I loved my soda as well- it was fizzy, fruity, and sweet. My friend said that she enjoyed her burger too.Overall I loved having lunch here. The bill cost $297 for both of us, but was worth it.

The only thing I have to criticise is the patty being a bit under-flavoured. I actually really liked the sides, the chips were crispy and hot and the coleslaw was sour and refreshing, perfect for a heavy meal.1S'mores MilkshakeThis needs no fancy title, just simply a glass of goodness!

It's got a very strong vanilla base with chocolate syrup, and to top it off with the indulging marshmallow fluff, very sweet and fattening #calories #noshame!

Central,American,"What better place for a US style burger joint than Hollywood Road? I'd walked past Burger Circus a heap of times while exploring Soho, but it had always been super busy, with queues down the street. I've never been one for queuing, so I'd just keep walking by. It would take planning to get in to test out these burgers, and judging by the queues, I was anticipating a superior burger (no pressure!).Designed to resemble a train carriage, Burger Circus plays homage to the original American diners which often operated out of abandoned railway cars and were sometimes open twenty four hours a day, seven days a week. Not quite open 24/7, Burger Circus plies its trade in freshly ground burgers, all American Sandwiches and traditional deserts from 12pm until late. So, we'd planned our morning around hitting the joint around 12 to ensure we didn't have to wait.It was a good thing too, we were standing out the front of the Hollywood Road burger joint shortly after 12 and most of the seats were already taken. In fact, our only option was to sit at the bar counter, which actually suited us better, we could get a first had view of Burger Circus in action. Unlike some of the other burger joints around HK, where there is a limited menu, the Burger Circus menu is action packed, with a heap of burgers, sides, sandwiches and a pretty extensive drinks selection. 0SC wasn't feeling to well, so opted out of a burger and ordered straight from the dessert menu. I thought for my first burger, I'd try the Circus Classic, which comprised of a 5oz beef patty with lettuce, tomato and Circus sauce. The simple sounding burger was actually perfect for someone like me, I love the simple classics and this had all the markings of being a beauty. It was presented old school style, in a cardboard box and standing upright. I could see it was paced with lettuce and tomato but the patty didn't seem that thick, so I wondered how it would be cooked medium as requested. My first bite answered all my questions and more. It was a revelation! The fresh ground meat patty was juicy and a perfect medium and the fresh lettuce and tomato seemed a perfect match. The circus sauce was incredibly, slightly sweet, it wasn't overpowering and really enhanced the burger. I liked it, I liked it a lot.2 1Shortly after my burger came out, my salted caramel milkshake was delivered. I'd probably have preferred it before the burger, so the timing was a little out. Timing aside, it was a monster of a drink, thick caramel milkshake in a traditional tall glass, topped with whipped cream - it even had a cherry on top! There was a sprinkling of salt on the cream, which was a little odd but made more sense once I mixed the concoction together. Ahhh, salted caramel goodness.0After quite some wait, we needed to ask for SC's banana split. All was forgiven when the simply amazing looking banana split was presented. Talk about tradition, this could have come out of the 1950's and been transported to the 21st century (no, time travel has still not been invented - I think?). Lots of beautiful ice cream inside a split banana and covered in whipped cream, with cherries on top. It was drool worthy, but instead of drool, SC just got stuck into it and smiled the whole time.1 I really loved my Burger Circus experience, in particular that Circus Classic, which had everything I could want in a burger (that is, it didn't come standard with pickles). The problem was, I wanted another straight after, and then again that same night for dinner. In fact we walked by around 7:30pm to get another, but the queue was too long, so we grabbed pizza instead.Yeah, I'll be back to Burger Circus, namely because it's right on the way home from work, but also because the burgers are spectacular. It's a cool little spot, with emphasis on little - Burger Circus only has about a dozen tables and fills up pretty quickly (although it also turns over pretty quickly). I reckon they could have had a space twice the size and I'm betting it won't be long before a second spot opens up.Actually, I think I might have to wander down tonight for dinner.0001010Supplementary InformationGet there early otherwise you could be waiting for a while",Burger Circus,4.5,150,nan,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-burger-circus/436353?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
Central,American,"We thought the food at Craftsteak was pretty good but we are very disappointed with the service at Craftsteak. I can name a number of incidents regarding their service during our short 1 hour lunch break.1. When we walked in the restaurant, the manager / waiter came straight up to us, without asking if we had a reservation and said that the restaurant is full. We told him we had a reservation and we saw an empty table right next to the door so I asked if we could sit there. He said that someone had booked that table and its unavailable. We insisted that we made a reservation and asked him to check. After checking, the manager came back to us without any response, and instead started cleaning the table and said we should sit there.We understand that there may be errors with reservations and thats fine. However, the manager could have communicated with us without banning us right away. It made us feel we were unreasonable to have wanted a table at the restaurant that we made a reservation in advance.2. When we sat down, we quickly knew what we wanted to eat and told the manager that we were ready to order. He came back and started taking our order, however, as we were sitting right next to the door, he kept welcoming guests or talking to guests at the door before he finished taking our order. Before we even started ordering, the manager told us not to chase any of our orders today, as the kitchen is really busy during lunch. We ordered 3 sets and 2 of the mains were Angus Sirloin Beef, without asking us what our preference was, he assumed that we wanted it cooked to Medium, however, we heard him mumbling and we corrected him that we wanted the steak cooked to Medium Rare. When the food came after 15 minutes, we were handed our plates that were placed in very awkward positions (e.g. I had steak, but the plate was placed vertically instead of horizontally).We understand that during lunch hours it can get very busy at the door, however, with normal respect, I think the manager should have taken our order first before serving anyone else at the door? Also, I think the manager should have explained to us in a friendlier matter that the kitchen is very busy during lunch hours, and it may take a little longer than usual for the food to be serve, rather than ask us not to chase. As a customer, I think we should have the right to ask about our food when it isnt served on time. Moreover, it may sound tedious, but I think customers should have the final choice on how they want the food to be served, an assumption is not acceptable. Finally, I think its basic etiquette that a server should have to place food in the right position for their customers at a western restaurant.3. During the meal, we realized that we werent given napkins nor were we given bread for the whole meal. We chased another Chinese waitress for the bread, but were not responded with good attitude. The waitress acknowledged with the slightest nod and no smile on her face at all. Also, we chased her twice, but neither the napkins nor the bread came in the end.I would have expected that a restaurant under Dining Concepts should have sufficient training on how to act in a restaurant, even during the busiest hours.

Finally, I highly appreciate that Dining Concepts will match our donation of $1 on our final bill, but I think it would be great if the manager could have explained to us the extra $1 on our bill first and not just handing it over (without a smile) and looking impatient.We had high expectations with restaurants under Dining Concepts, and we were glad that the food quality at Craftsteak wasnt bad.

Central,American,"As a man always on the hunt for a great burger I thought I had found mysef a great burger spot just around the corner from my office -- great location, fun/cool decoration, innovative burgers. Unfortunately this was not the case, and I would 100% rather eat at Mcdonalds than eating here again.Why am I hating on this place? This is why:Expensive: Having researched the place on Open Rice I had reason to believe that this was not an overpriced restaurant, as the price shown was 'Below $50'. This was a complete ripoff (false advertising anyone?) as I paid HKD 113 for a burger and a canned drink. This price obviously did not turn me away, as a high quality burger is worth its weight in gold, which brings us to...Size: My Kimchi burger, if you're even allowed to call it that, was tiny -- the burger was smaller than my fist which is far from the massive burgers you see in the pictures. I actually had to get another meal after finishing lunch, which made todays lunch even more disappointing. Well sometimes you have to judge food by quality over quantity, which brings us to...Quality: Even though the size of the burger was a complete letdown I was still excited to finish the burger and try the (seemingly) delicious Kimchi/Burger combination. Unfortunately there was no real kimchi taste, which is a letdown because that was the main reason I tried the damn burger in the first place. Moreover, there was no beef patty on my burger (maybe my mistake in assuming that there would be?) which essentially means that I paid ~100 dollars for a 'Tiny Kimchi Sandwich' -- this name would give customers a better understanding of what they are paying for.At least the staff was friendly. And the interior decoration was cool -- if you're American or some sort of hipster that is.",Boomshack,2.2,113,nan,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-boomshack/434066?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
Central,American,"Well well well, this time, my caucasian coworkers have brought a new high to my burger experience. As someone with no knowledge of this place whatsoever (before I went), my coworker helped me choose by ordering a double happiness (youneed to scan the menu's QR code to seea ""secret"" menu)and the duck fat fries to share.I like the ambience of this place which is casual. The music on the backgroundwere all familiar songs. What a good casual Monday lunch place.It took awhile for the food to come, but man the look of the burger was amazing. The double happiness beef patties were thick (1 inch each) and the cheese was oozing out. The burger buns were different from the normal burgers, with lots of oil (I'm assuming they are buttered).It was a mess to cut the burger but it was worth it. I can't believe I had trouble eating the half portion as I thought it's not that big compared to the ones in North America but wow, I was so full! No wonder my other 2 coworkers were actually sharing the normal burger + fries and can't finish it. The fries were also very crispy and yummy.All in all, very satisfyingburger fix that feels like I am back to America, but I don't think I will go back on my own because the burger is really hard to be finished by just me!Supplementary InformationScan the QR code on the menu for more options!",The Butchers Club Burger,3.5,90,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-the-butchers-club-burger/434418?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

Ithad a door, but you didn't need a door to get in? Haha.. There were a few TVs showing sports, which made it feel like a chill place.

The Pulled Pork Sandwich was similar to the beef sandwich. The meat in this was more tender, but was also a bit dry. It had more sauce than the pork, which made this sandwich a bit better than the beef sandwich.Baby Back Ribs$ 1383Baby Back Ribs$ 1385. The Baby Back Ribs ($138) was the best meat dish out of the 3.

I noticed that the lemons were kinda grilled. I wonder if that was what made the iced tea so special!

Central,American,"1Competition in Hong Kong's restaurant market is quite fierce; just by looking into the soho area, we are not that surprised to see the turn-over speed of new restaurants. At the old Nico's place, now there's the fresh new red brand, Linguini Fini, which is moved from Wellington Street and finishes its renovation. This restaurant keeps high popularity and reputation among locals and expats since its opening by its 100% handmade pasta, modern dining concept lead by their Italian-American chef, and through recent visit, I learnt more ideas about farm-grown except 'just a place to fill up the stomach'.11Instead of changing the whole space layout, I see more soft changes in the restaurant to be matched with the causal and simple modern style. A cheerful and young feeling is brought out by the restaurant's main color-tone which warms up every one. The dining area is designed smartly to express the fun and the environmental-caring concept which is another key concept that the owner and the chef are willing to express. We were seated around the long wooden bench table and on the colorful wasted-oil-drum. There are a little garden with a lot of greens at the backyard, where is also a mini fresh food waste composting station. 1Lunch time is featured in semi-buffet plus selected main course style which is quite fit to the needs of people who are working around Central. 2-3 types of ham and cheese, grilled or fresh-mixed salads seasoned by olive oil and vinegar, etc; don't expect a huge selection of starters, but you will be satisfied by its qualified ingredients and flavor. 2Bronx PizzaThe New York style 18'' pizza is the new item with the renovation. It wowed us a lot not only by its huge size, but the attractive pizza top. Special meatball with the kitchen-producted pepperoni were 'printed' on the egg-yellow cheese & bloody tomato sauce layer; fresh herbs and thin slices of mozzarella balanced the flavor as well as the colorful looking. It's thin pizza but not in a super crispy and crunchy way; the heavy cheese and the heat made the huge triangle slice of pizza moisture and melted. It's an intensive taste; mild by the sauce meanwhile appetite-stimulating by the cheesy aroma and spicy sense.3Fragrant Grass Linguini with Parm Fonduta (back) & Fettucine Funghi (front)I became fettucine-lover since my first try in Rome, and I would like to give a 8/10 mark to Linguini Fini's Fettucine Funghi. I have successfully found the right chewiness and eggy aroma from their pasta; the losing 2 points would be counted to the heavy oily taste as my personal judgement. The milky-green color pasta, Fragrant Grass Linguini with parm Fonduta, was ranked as the top 2nd among the 4 pasta dishes we have tried that day. It's a really creamy texture all around the al-dente pasta, a light 'essential' of herb flavor mixed into the creamy-cheesy sauce completely and we could not have too much but tried our best to have more bites, just because of its deliciousness. 1Radiatore alla VodkaTop 1 coming  The Chef plays a game with traditional Italian pasta by adding spicy nduja laced cream sauce; by using this Italian pork spread (nduja) and leveraging the spices of it, the dish impressed us at our first bite immediately; it made your brain memorize this new special taste once your tongue absorbed those 'bio-chemical signals'. 2Apple Caramel Pie2Chocolate Banana CakeThe adding desserts were obviously in a New York style - big size, big taste! The apple pie was the rawest one I have seen in Hong Kong, with largely chopped apple. I love the thin and hard texture of pie with a strong butter aroma. The cake, was not that good-looking to be honest, but to a sweet-lover/chocolate-lover, it is definitely a 'eye-killer'. It tasted just like its melting look, very chocolate & banana in the very fresh way; the banana layer was so fresh that it was like I was having a bite of banana while drinking cold thick chocolate.Supplementary Information* No service charge* Lunch around $150 per head* Dinner around $350 per head* Weekday Happy Hour (5pm - 7pm): All-You-Can-Eat chicken wings & Free-flow PBR (beer)",Linguini Fini,3.8,150,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-linguini-fini/190645?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw
Central,American,"I have been hearing about this place a lot lately, especially the original one in wan chai.As i live in Soho, I was very exicted to go try it myself and as it is very close to my place.When I arrive there, I ask to be seated somewhere but the staff just told me go find a seat by myself, which i found kind of odd and rude, but it is ok I guess it is the policy there!After finding my table, I was ready to get my food but surprisingly they only have one burger on the menu and a secret menu that you have to find on the website and use the QR code..such a waiste of time, don't u think so? I mean why don't u put it directly on the menu instead of obliging people to go on their smartphone and waiste time?Anyway, I order the very classic burger they have, the service was a bit slow (17min to wait to be accurate) considering that they only have one kind of burger to do. Eventually, I received my burger, it was a bit small compare to their ad but i guess it is marketing! The burger and french freid were good, i wouldn't say it is memorable tho for the price.So to put in a nutshell, I wouldn't recommend this place I think there is definately better burger place in town for much better deal even tho it was ok/good. But to be honest, I expect a little more considering the price of the burger and all the feedback I had from the press.

Central,American,"This has ought to be the abosulte WORST dining experience I have ever had. It was so bad that I had to start an account just to vent the frustration I had with this experience. I do not normally do this since I hardly ever stumble across a restaurant that good or THAT HORRENDOUS that I feel like I need to comment on..but Restoration brought dining to a whole new level.Where to start...So my friend had reserved a table for 8 three weeks ago for a Thanksgiving brunch on Saturday. She told us that this restaurant serves Chicken and Waffles (which is not a usual occurence in HK), and that they have this fancy Thanksgiving turducken menu (i.e. turkey with duck and chicken) for that specific weekend. We were all super excited to try the food and all, so we had our friend put in 4 turkducken orders and 4 chicken and waffle orders for our brunch. The restaurant asked for a 800$ deposit, which is fair I suppose since we did put in orders for this 'special' entree. So during the three weeks, our friend called in three separate times due to the changes in the number of people from 8 to 16 at a point and back to 7 in the end, however, our order of turkducken had only changed from 4 to 3 orders with 4 other orders of chicken and waffles (even though this restaurant is known to primarily serve chicken and waffles, yet we have to pre-order it... so what happens to the walk-in guests?)PS. The Thanksgiving menu is $298HKD and has a main of either turducken or chicken/turkey (and if we add $100, we can have all you can eat chicken OR turkey + all side dishes).Anyway, on the day of our brunch, the hostess came over and said we didn't confirm our orders of turkducken so there will be none served for our table. There will still be turkey or chicken and chicken and waffles that we can choose from. We explained to her how we have called in on three separate occasions and have made the orders quite clear, and we have definitely confirmed our orders. She struck back with poor attitude blaming us for not 'confirming' though email. We were very disappointed, but what can we do (at this point, we just wanted to have our lunch). So we just ordered two turkeys from the thanksgiving menu (which we have previously asked if we could share if we don't get seconds, and they said it was fine with them), and 5 chicken and waffles ( and somehow they had the chicken and waffles reserved for us, but not the turkduckens).The 5 chicken and waffles came and two scones + two soups came from the thanksgiving menu. Let's start with the taste of the chicken and waffles - the waffles were so soggy and it was definitely NOT freshly made. Eggos tasted better than those waffles. The rub on the chicken was quite tasty, but the chicken itself was far from juicy. You literally had to keep drinking water to get that meat down your throat. But okay, we appreciated the effort, since we don't know where else we could get chicken and waffles here in HK.Next to the turkey menu. One small appetizier plate of turkey came with one drumbstick and a few slices of breast meat came. The waitress asked who is having the turkey, and I said we are sharing it. She said no you cannot, since this is an all you can eat menu. So to stop the fuss, my friends had her put the plate in front of me. Then we called her over again and said we are not going to get seconds so can we share? She kept fussing on how it is an all-you-can-eat, so you can't share. We repeated ourselves like 5 times before she finally understood what we meant, and said okay. The side dishes then came, and there were about 6 different side dishes in a soufle-sized ramkein each. So we thought okay, there must be another set of turkey + 6 side dishes coming out soon. That obviously didn't happen, nothing came out even after we were done all the chicken and waffles and the first order of turkey and side dishes. We asked if there is another coming, and they said that was it. Now, let's not forget we are paying 298$ for each, and all they gave us was 6 small side dishes + a few breast meat + ONE drumstick, and we are expectd to pay 600$ for that? I can have a Grand Hyatt Buffett dinner for that price and be one happy camper with food that is 3x better than this. Let's not forget this is only lunch.We asked to speak with the manager, and basically to summarize this, he was nothing but RUDE. He would talk over us and we were telling him our problems. He had NO intention of trying to make us feel better and leave on a happy note. He made it seem like we are just a bunch of cheap idiots who are unwilling to pay for our second turkey order, which DIDN't EVEN COME. In the end, he said let's settle this, I will take one order of that turkey off your bill. We were enraged. First off, he didn't listen to our concerns, he was far from sincere when he apologized, and he thought he was doing us a huge favour taking that one order of non-existent food off our bill. He kept talking and talking and wouldn't listen to us. After we were able to speak for a bit, he struck back ""all i hear is the same thing over and over again"". That was the breaking point. Excuse me for repeating ourselves when you weren't even listening to our concerns. All in all a TERRIBLE dinning experience that I would not recommend ANYONE there for sanity purposes.Supplementary InformationI hope I have provided a detail enough insight into our dining experience for all you amazing diners out there and that I would not even recommend someone I dislike to try.

There were 4-5 options of main dishes to choose from. My friend ordered cheesy chicken fillet , I had the tenderloin steak sandwich with fries.At first I was worried about the portion of the main dishes, as this restaurant seemed more of a cafe for waffles. However the portion was surprisingly LARGE.I am a huge eater (trust me. when I eat, I eat like a man) but the portion was large for me! my friend's chicken fillet was served in a hot sizzling pat with cheese melting on tiny potato cubes and chicken fillets. The scent of chicken was overwhelmingly goooood. I kinda regretted ordering the steak sandwich when it arrived becoz it looked boring in comparison to my friend's sizzling symphony. HOWEVER, I was wronggg! the steak wasn't boring at all!!! it was beautifully seasoned, juicy, with some mushroom, it was a lil salty for me>< but overall it was very good for a cafe standard. the bread was baguette, buttered, fresh out from the toaster.Starting at 1:10 the staff urged us twice to order drinks and dessert as the second batch of lunch diners coming in. having waffle as dessert really made my day! The portion was half a waffle size but i thought it was a decent size as I got so full after savoring the main dish. the waffle was freshly made with a bbt of cream and Nutella sauce on top. It was crunchy on the outside and soft inside. u could taste the freshness of it. No cardboard taste at all like some other waffles.

Central,American,"My bf is a burger lover so I bring him here for a workday lunch...Rather than the burger I am more attracted to the cheesy fries served by this diner place since it has been a long time for me to have some decent chilli cheesy fries in hong kong. Thats why we started with fried onion rings and then a burger set (mushroom burger + chilli cheesy fries + soda).The onion ring is okay, nothing too bad, nothing too spectacular neither. The portion is proportional to its price so I would say its optional if you just want to add some different taste to your burger menu.As for the burger (sorry for not taking pictures) my bf said the beef patty is juicy and the garlic mayo is great...the bread is toasted too...but he wished the beef patty is a bit bigger (its not a fair comment tho as he ALWAYS has the ""American portion"" standard).And here comes the long-waited cheesy fries...good as expected!

Central,American,"It's been a long time waiting but finally there is a restaurnt that serves good ribs and american diner food in Central! I have now been to The Diner twice and both times I have been impressed with the quality of food there. First Impressions:The Diner is decorated in an American 1950's style diner with red booths and classic diner style interiors. The sign at the door says no reservations as they want to be authentic in the Diner style dining experience. We arrived at the restaurant for a late lunch and there was no waiting time as it was off peak. Previously I went there for lunch and still managed to get a seat pretty quickly. They play great music typical of what you might expect to hear in america, a lot of great blues and 50's and 60's rock and roll. I felt like I'm in a ""Grease"" Movie which was cool. Menu:The menu is printed on the paper diposable placemats. They have the perfect selection of American favourites with the majority of the menu devoted to different types of burgers. However, they also serve salads including Caesarand Cobb salads. They have a beef burgerless selection which includes pulled port, chicken and veggie burgers. Plus they serve the classic sandwiches such as Club Sandwich. Don't get fooled by the ""Small Plates"" section, although the words used make it sound like a starter, the dishes are large and is sufficient as a main course. They also have a brunch menu which I can't wait to try. Hoping it will be an authentic american diner breakfast experience. What we ordered:We decided to go the ""Love me tender ribs"" and the ""Sunshine Burger"" and ordered a lemon ice tea and a mojito mocktail. The Ribs were as the decription says, TENDER and the homemade BBQ sauce was just the right combo of tangy and spice. I have to say that we have been looking for a place that serves great BBQ ribs in Hong Kong and have finally found it. These ribs are delicious, moist, tender and melt in your mouth. The portions is generous - you get 6 large meaty ribs for the price (HKD148) which I think is good value. The ribs are serves with a delicious and refreshing apple slaw. The sunshine burger was fresh and tasty. It comes with a fried egg, bacon, cheese and salad and supposedly a cripy onion ring, however my only gripe is that I think they must have forgotten the onion ring or ran out as there was caremalised onions in there instead. Would have been nice for them to have put the crispy onion ring in but the burger still tasted great without it. The dish is served with apple slaw and delicious thin crispy skin on french fries. The drinks were great, the mocktail mojito was yum, lots of lime and mint and perfect amount of sugar. Service:The first time I went, the service was just so so as it was lunch time and they only had one poor waitress serving but the second time was better, although there were not many customers in there at that time so not sure what it would be like when busy again. I hope they will make sure there are enough staff on the floor in the future. But overall, the wait staff were extrememly friendly. Ecouraged probably by the fact that the bill does NOT include a service charge and the wait staff must earn their tips from good service. I really like this as it encourages good service and you know they are actually getting the tips you leave instead of management pocketing it as in most other restaurants in HK. This is clearly stated on the menu. Verdict: We had a great experience and The Diner and will definately be back again. There are lots of other dishes that we would like to try still and it all looks pretty good. I highly recommend this place.Supplementary InformationService Charge Not included so tip you can on service qualityNo reservations available.",The Diner,4.7,170,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-the-diner/176935?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw
Central,American,"One hot Saturday afternoon, we decided to check out 85 South after seeing an ad for it in a magazine. One person in my party had tried it via catering before, so we were all interested in checking it out. The sun drenched, up-hill trek from the mtr to the restaurant left us all a little tired, but inside the air-con was blasting and there was only one other customer inside. We were able to sit immediately.Decor:The decor is ok - very sparse. Concrete floors and walls, with some murals on the walls. There's some large wooden tables and benches to sit on, as well as a small bar area. Each table has a roll of paper towels and a bucket with ketchup and three different types of BBQ sauces. It really reminded me many places I have been to in the US. I only am rating it a three, because to me it seems like there is a lot of untapped potential as the current decorations are very bland and interesting.Taste:The BBQ is cooked in the style of North Carolina. Slow cooked, tender, and full of flavour. There were three different types of sauces available: a more ""typical"" BBQ sauce (the table favourite), a vinegar-BBQ sauce, and a honey mustard BBQ sauce. We all ordered the pulled pork and the ribs - all extremely tender and flavourful. I highly recommend the pulled pork. The meals also came with coleslaw and thick french fries. The coleslaw has a more sweet, vinegar like taste and I would say it was just ok, but dislike coleslaw in general. Everything else was extremely delicious and left everyone feeling full and happy.Service:The menu was posted on a blackboard at the counter where you order. After we ordered, they brought us our food. One of the workers, who I think was the manager, was extremely friendly. However when we were ordering, there was some confusion with the cashier about substituting a part of our order. We wanted to substitute the coleslaw for some baked-beans, but the cashier finally said we could only substitute the french fries for baked beans. We were confused about we could order, the cashier did help to explain it to us clearly and was unwilling to provide some basic customer service. That was a disappointment, because I was told the baked beans were delicious and I really wanted to try them but the full price for a side was too expensive for one person. Value for money:I feel the price for the meal was fair, but the price for the sides and drinks was too much. The drinks costs $20 for just a can (!!!) and $50 for a side order. They were extremely rigid about what sides we could substitute in a meal, which would cost an extra $20. For one person, $50 is just too much to get a side, especially if you're already ordering a meal. There should be more options about which items in the meal you can substitute. And perhaps some small and large side order options for different prices.I highly recommend this restaurant if you want some delicious BBQ.",85 South,4.2,100,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-85-south/152879?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw
Central,American,"I was extremely excited to see this new item on the menu - McVeggie!! Told myself I had to try it within the offer period.unexpectedly tasty1unexpectedly tastyI know most people would turn up their noses at a meat-less burger but hear me out. And give this a try. I was pleasantly surprised.McVeggie burger - $15.5 (iirc) a la carte The burger consists of a deep fried patty (made of green pea, corn kernels, carrot, pureed mushrooms, potato). The chinese name is rather misleading - I thought the patty might be a large portobello steak. But I guess it's difficult to preserve a portobello steak in a cost-effective way and/or season it in a way that the general public would accept.Originally was a bit concerned about how it's deep fried, but when I bit into it, the yummy factor offset the health concern. The patty has a crisp exterior, and a slightly chewy center - just slightly glutinous. It tastes like falafel without the exotic middle eastern spices - perhaps omitted to please the crowd.and cheap and filling.1and cheap and filling.There's more lettuce than usual inside the bun.

Central,American,"When I first started working in Central last year, lunch time was actually one of the most intimidating hours because finding affordable and comfortable places in the area was actually a challenge and I never thought I would be able to make it through. Now, having exceeded the maximum number of months in one place, it's hard to believe it's been over a year working here, and it's even harder to believe there are so many reasonably-priced and delicious restaurants in our pedigree! Little did we know that there's a real hidden gem serving prime rib sandwiches in a Central alley. When T told us that he hasn't been there before, we were like ""STFU!"", and we decided to go there for our happy-almost-end-of-the-week-lunch/Chinese New Year lunch gathering last month.0Located inside Wo On Lane, Westwood Carvery is a small and casual place with only 4 to 5 tables, so early booking is a must. The place is an easy one to miss and you may casually disregard its existence at first glance. Service was friendly and polite. Having reserved a table at 1:15 p.m., Yves, being her charming and punctual self, successfully got us seats at 1 p.m. and wonderfully prepared some cute red envelopes for us!0Westwood Carvery offers several lunch sets ranging from $128 to $200 which are served with either a salad or a soup, and a drink. The famous Prime Rib ""Dip"" Sandwich set was what we came here for. For that, they offer two sizes: the regular size ($128) and the large size ($168). Since it's not officially the end of the week yet, and you know, we wanted to stay fit and healthy, we opted for the regular size one.0(1) Believe it or not, T chose the Green Salad to start with which was surprising considering he's the athlete among us. However, it was certainly a decent and light salad to set your stomach for how much meat you are about to gulp down your throat. The salad dressing tasted fine and distinctive.Green Salad1Green Salad(2) Yves and C ordered the Cream of Spinach Soup which was quite pleasantly presented. The soup was naturally flavourful and creamy, and the tiny bits of bacon further elevated the taste of the soup. It was just nice to have something warm (and green) during these cold, cold days.Cream of Spinach Soup0Cream of Spinach Soup(3) The long-awaited Prime Rib ""Dip"" Sandwich finally arrived with freshly made creamy horseradish on a ciabatta bread and beautifully came with French fries and an Apple. It was definitely worth the hype! The taste of prime rib, the sauce and the bread interacted with one another magnificently, forming some of the most delightful and attractive tastes in our mouths. The beef was tender, moist and after dipping into the flavourful gravy sauce, the meat instantly melt on our tongues, due to being gleefully and perfectly cooked! The fries were sheer deliciousness and the apple was also a refreshing and healthy complement to such a heaty, meaty dish! T certainly liked the sandwich very much as he finished the two of them very quickly! And no, he was not that hungry.Prime Rib ''Dip'' Sandwich set ($128/regular)0Prime Rib ''Dip'' Sandwich set ($128/regular)Prime Rib ''Dip'' Sandwich set ($128/regular)0Prime Rib ''Dip'' Sandwich set ($128/regular)Prime Rib ''Dip'' Sandwich0Prime Rib ''Dip'' SandwichPrime Rib ''Dip'' Sandwich0Prime Rib ''Dip'' SandwichPrime Rib ''Dip'' Sandwich0Prime Rib ''Dip'' SandwichWestwood Carvery is fantastic (except that they keep increasing their price).

Central,American,"Having long been on my wait list, this lazy Friday afternoon was the perfect setting to try this creole influenced restaurant and cure my holiday hangovers (and cold =( ). Even before we started eating you could feel the warmth and soul resonating from the atmosphere - decor consisted of post-Katrina window frames and shelves, stark light bulbs in wire cages, and steel chairs. Rumor was it that some of these items were transferred from the hurricane battered New Orleans to the restaurant in memory of those lost and the damage done. That is some true heart!The music also fit the ambience very well, with the most soulful voices in music warmly playing in the background. I wouldn't be surprised if they had curators carefully pairing their food with music!

It was thicker than expected, with an almost chili-like texture, but a wonderful medley of flavors from the stewed vegatables and spices, and the occassional scallops and prawns swimming in the stew gave it some bite, while the slight intensity of the peppers provided the kick. Despite the okra, which I'm not particularly fond of, this was easily my favorite dish here. Also Ceelo Green's blaring tenor voice in the background somehow perfectly complemented this soup.As innocent as this pasta looks, it packs a punch!0As innocent as this pasta looks, it packs a punch!Next up was the main, a Penne Jambalaya, an unexpectedly spicy dish. In fact, so spicy that my friend couldn't taste the paprika on his side of Fries (+$25) after. It was a twist on the tradionally rice-based jambalaya, just substituting Penne as the key carbohydrate. Flavors were still wonderfully packed with cajun spices, with a good amount of smokiness and spiciness (that I suspect came from the Andouille), and well-seasoned chunks of meat. I prefer the traditional version, but this one was still delicious, especially if you enjoy the extra heat! For a dish like this, they (the mystery curators) paired it with Johnny Cash's cover of Personal Jesus and Hurt in his amazing raspy barritone voice.

The pulled pork was smokey and succulent with strands of fibres that fell apart in your mouth, and was accompanied by a sweet honey-like sauce and sharp pungent purple onions. A nice touch was the slightly charred bun that had a crunch to it. This is a wonderfully satisfying sandwich, and ranks right up there with the roast beef sandwich at Westwood Carvery (still the winner for me though ;p ), just remember to add the Tobasco or Crystal hot sauce to bring it to the next level!

Central,American,"Bought a group buying deal just last Friday and decided to try this place as I have a craving for burgers recently.Walked in at 12:30pm and there was no one there. Even the staff were hiding behind the counters and I have to shout ""hello"" a few times to get their attention. But the staff in front of the cashier who heard me choose to ignore me and the one further away came to me (this is quite a strange arrangement).Showed my coupon and the staff told me they have no fries so it's onion rings intead, and then let me to choose a drink. And then I sat myself at one of the stools. More customers came in later which is comforting. I waited for about 15-20 mins for the mealcuz the food was made from order I guess.Burger: The bun was lightly toasted and the sesame on top slightly burned. Looks alright. The beef patty was a bit dry but at least it's well cooked and not pink. But I am no big fan of the lettuce and red onions. They were very cold (straight out from the fridge) and tasted weird with the hot meat and bun. And then the ketchup...I think they have put at least 2 tablespoon of COLD ketchup in - too much even for fries. I had to use my utensils to get rid of the ketchup to finish it off.Onion rings: freshly fried. Nothing special though.I think this is good as a try. But I won't use another coupon to come back.

Central,American,"The restaurantMy wife and I arrived relatively early at 12:00 on a Sunday (German style), so we could immediately get a table since they just opened. The mouthwatering aroma of their food was not annoying as standing in the middle of the kitchen, but just enough to create a big appetite. The decoration is nice with contemporary graffitti on their walls. Don't forget to leave your tag/mark on the restroom walls -pen is provided by the restaurant!Service was nice and chatty not only to us, but to other patrons joining the restaurant later - yet leaving enough room to enjoy the food. Not sure whether it's normal, but since my wife is on a special low-carb diet, he was flexible enough to swap fries against more cole-slaw. Just a minor favour, but still leaving a positive impression.Juicy pulled pork and tender ribs!We started off with their delicious house-made lemonade, which was just right. Many others add too much sugar and others add too much acidity or bitterness. I liked it, because it was really well-balanced in sweetness and tartness. The owner explained to us that they will introduce some spiked drinks later.Our original plan was to order a portion of pulled pork and then a portion of their ribs, which were only available at 13:00 since they smoke those fresh over hours to get them really tender. That pulled pork was amazingly juicy and tasty! We've been tasting pulled pork around the world, including ""Fette Sau"" in Brooklyn (featured in NY Times, etc.), which is famous for their pulled pork and where many dozen people queue up just to get seats. 85 South's pulled pork is right up there or even better in juicyness and taste.The pulled pork can be accompanied by three different sauces, each with their very own delicious taste direction and compliment the pulled pork very nicely. Since there is a full bottle of each sauce on every table, there's definitely no need to ration - go full in if you want! The cole-slaw is not based on mayonnaise, but as ha very tasty tomato-base, which feels much lighter and has ha nice tanginess.We loved it so much, that I somehow messed up our nice plan and went for another portion of pulled pork, but this time with fries for me. Theyhave steak fries and while I'm rather a fan of thin fries, they use a special Southern Californian seasoning, which give those fries an extra kick. Some might say it's too salty, but for me it was just right.Already quite full, I had to convince my wife to taste the ribs. She didn't want to taste even one single piece because she was so full off the pulled pork already. But when the ris arrived and after she tasted only one single bite, she was literally hooked! I was already quite stuffed as well, but couldn'tstop eating more of those delicious ribs. They don't come out glazed with any sauce, but come instead with a very nice and unique spice rub. And that's perfectly fine, as you can still add any of the three sauces if you like. But we just enjoyed the ribs as they were.Totally stuffed after those three portions and deperately wanting a digstion nap, we were already thinking when we could come back to have more. But next time, we will stick to one portion per person - at least that's once again only the plan...Supplementary InformationThe HKD 150 per head were because we had 3 dishes, which made us very full.

Central,American,"We'd had our eye on this place for a while, and came in for lunch when the sushi place across the way didn't have a table for us. I thought it was good.Fried chicken: the chicken was piping hot and tender. The skin was crisp and the batter light, though heavily flavored with herbs. There was a definite tang to it, perhaps it was buttermilk? It doesn't stack up to, for example, Popeye's, but it was pretty good American-style fried chicken, which is tough to come by. B+Mashed potatoes: the potatoes were flavorful, though overly lumpy. The ""gravy"" was tomato-based but OK. BReuben: my wife's favorite sandwich is the Reuben, and we haven't been able to find one in HK until now. She gives it A-, but would give it an A if it had more sauerkraut. A-Fries: I found them a little flavorless, mushy, and overly ""potato""-y, if a potato can be that. The ketchup was Del Monte. Why??? C+Overall, we had a great experience, and will definitely come back, as many of the menu items seemed worth a try.

Central,American,"Well well, its another Central lunch with my mates As we're all poor people (at the moment), we couldn't afford to have lunch in places like MO, Four Seasons ... etc., and today we came to Stanley 11 for lunch.  Since we were running out of time, we rushed straight into the lifts.  My friend suggested Japanese food, fed up with the meals we had, we quickly closed the doors of the lift and moved on to the second floor.What we seeThe environment was pleasing and modern, with a bit of retro black n white style (honestly I don't quite like black n white) Black n white0Black n whiteThe restaurant was quite packed during lunch hour (okay thats pretty normal?)  We waited for a couple of minutes at the entrance and we were brought to our table, we thought the service was fine Since we had a look at the menu during our wait, we quickly ordered our lunch.What we orderThe lunch menu offers a variety of food (ofcourse not as broad as the you would expect on a ""HK style Cha Chan Teng"")  Just a general idea of what they serve: steak, pasta, risotto, pizza, the normal kind of food you would expect to be on a western menu.  As you would see, they serve risotto, I'm not entirely sure whether you would categorise that as Australian/American cuisine (as you would note in the info box on Openrice).The gentleman who took our orders was very tall and handsome, you don't expect to see such man in a restaurant, brilliant (the ""Gentleman""). The Gentleman clearly has good memory, we spelled out our orders and food, soup, etc so quickly that even I can't remember what exactly I have ordered but he delivered the food without a single mistake.  well done mate! For the Apps, we were given the choice of a salad or soup of the day, and ofcourse we asked what the soup and salad is.  The Gentleman responded the soup of the day being seafood soup (he didn't specify what seafood soup, and if im not wrong, lobster bisque and a clam chowder tastes a bit different) and salad......... (and this is a direct quote from the gentleman) ""is just some salad"" he said, as well as laughed.I'm sorry but it appears to me the Gentleman simply didn't know/care about their own menu. What we tastewarm0warmWarm bread was served with salted butter, I would say, fair.Yet no plates were given for our bread, leaving bread crumbs on the table, perhaps this is their style?  I saw them sweeping bread crumbs off each table after diners left, what is the point... but who cares when the bread was nice and warm! interesting0interestingSoup arrived and before we were being served, we were told the ""seafood soup"" had been sold out, and the waiter offered an alternative, we were left with little (if any) choice and a cream vegetable soup was then placed in front of us.as usual0as usualAs usual, my mate chucked her leftover bread next to my soup for photo, I have absolutely no idea why she kept doing that, it doesn't help much with writing a perfect food review does it?  So, dear respectful Editor, please ignore this photo.The vegetable soup tastes milky and creamy but slightly watery.  I can taste broccoli in the soup, i mean the taste was alright, but it would be better if it isn't that diluted.  odd0oddMy learned friend did complain about the lack of correct cutleries, she asked if that was for the soup.  We paused, then nodded and continued with our meal. What about the entrees?Three of us ordered the following:1. Lasagne2. Salmon fettucini in cream sauce3. Mussels and scallop with pumpkin risottoLasagneLasagne0LasagneMy learned friend said it was cooked nicely, rich and a bit filling for her.  Salmon fettucini in cream sauceFettucini0FettuciniIsn't it beautiful the fettucini?  However my learned friend (literally) refused to comment on the dish (due to the incident stated below).Mussels and scallop with pumpkin risottoRisotto0RisottoRisotto was perfectly cooked, the pumpkin sauce was not too sweet but just right, the sweetness brings out the freshness of the scallops, it was brilliant.  However, not so brilliant were the mussels, I can see they were seasoned with pepper and spices but not evenly, resulting in two out of the three tasted a bit fishy, what a pity.   Although cherry tomatoes doesn't really match with the dish, I liked it.Risotto normally doesn't come in a big portion, but look at the picture..!  I was very full after the lunch!Tea and coffee followed, we ordered iced lemon tea and syrup served separately What we thinkI mean, honestly, I think its a fair lunch, the food certainly meet the standards but there are rooms for improvement.  The atmosphere was friendly.                  Supplementary InformationDuring check out, it took them a while (10 minutes) for the credit card to come back.No explanation was given by the waiter, we walked out straight to the entrance (where the cashier was) to wait, since it was taking so long and we were in a hurry.  Eventually they told us the credit card got mixed up and someone took my mate's card.  Clearly this was untrue was he was holding the card in question.  Then they said in fact it was the bill that was mixed up and he showed us a voided credit card receipt with someone else's signature on it.  It took them another 5 minutes to tell us the story.

Central,American,"Haven't had a decent lunch in Central for a while, I decided to try out this one for a change as I have heard fairly reasonable comments from a few friends.The dining area is actually on the 5th Floor of the building while the lift only stops at the 6th floor where the bar is.  Having made a reservation beforehand, we were promptly led to our table.  I was rather surprised to find that the tables were rather packed together.  Apart from a few round tables at the periphery and the centre of the restaurant, the ones that sat 2-4 people were very close together.  One would have to negotiate the 1-foot gaps between the tables to the sitting benches, these gaps were so narrow that they would not be able to accommodate a medium-sized man or a lady with a bulky handbag.  The proximity between the tables would make private conversations very difficult.Between us, we had two 2-course lunches and one 3-course set lunch.  These two are basically the same with the inclusion of an extra main course from the menu in addition to a soup, the harvest buffet and a non-alcoholic drink.  The bread that came first was stale, cold and hard with only a little dish of butter to be shared between the 3 of us.  The carrot soup was lukewarm and bland.  The harvest buffet was basically a salad bar with some cold cuts.  Nothing to write home about.  Adding to the insult, there was some form of salad dressing (only one type available) which seemed ill-fitted to any of the veggies available.I had Bloomberger as the main course.  The meat was mediocre with no flavour whatsoever, I have tasted better meats from fast-food joints.On the plus side, the staff was fairly efficient, the high ceiling and large windows also gave the restaurant a very roomy and airy atmosphere.",Lily & Bloom,2.2,180,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-lily-bloom/48143?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
Central,American,"OK, the good news:A good assortment of bratwurst, condiments and mustards. Very tasty.Very clean. Very ""new"" look. Nice complimentary food and the only deep fried Mars bar with ice cream on the block.  And the bratwurst are excellent, as tasty as any and include some healthier choices. I had the Habanero which was excellent. Bad news? Well, the appetizer platters were a little skimpy for 168 each. But the hot wings on them were good---the rest (chicken fingers, some bread and scrawny calamari) were fair.The brats themselves are a little expensive. All these can be forgiven. But the waiting time for the food was ridiculous. We got our appetizer trays AFTER all the food had been served. They served all the fires well before any other food was brought out ---now we were a group of 11, but we were the only customers in the restaurant. They really have to iron out the kinks if this joint is going to make it.",BRAT,3.7,145,nan,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-brat/48410?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

Central,American,"Was looking for a place to have a nice lunch in Central with the girlfriend, and Bloom came to mind. Arriving at the restaurant, service was slightly on the disappointing end, as it took them quite a few minutes to find my reservation, and once seated, the waiters/waitresses did not seem to be too happy the whole time. Apart from this though, service was alright throughout lunch. (3/5)We quickly chose the 3 course set lunch, which includes a complimentary drink, and both chose the salad bar buffet for our appetizers. The oysters, poached shrimp and smoked salmon were quite fresh, while the elk salad was done quite well. There was also a flavored spinach that I made a second trip for. The rest of the selections were as expected, nothing that blew my mind, but was all decent. Other selections included a sausage and pees salad, truffle flavored eggs, caesar salad, a potato salad, pasta salad and cold cuts. (3/5)Next after the appetizer salad bar, came the soup for the lunch. Today's soup was a Cream of Wild Mushroom. This was very well done, with many soft bits of mushroom in the soup. The cream flavor was strong, but soup was quite liquid. Was very pleased with this. (5/5)For main courses, we selected the Braised Ox-tail and the Truffle Aioli Burger. The ox-tail was quite good, served hot and flavored well in a tomato based sauce. The burger came in a generous portion, but was a tad on the dry side though, and could have done with a little bit more of the Truffle Aioli sauce. The fries on the side were quite well down, crispy on the skin, and soft in the middle. (3/5)Lunch ended with our dessert selection, a Croissant bread pudding with peanut butter fudge, and an Apple Pie. The apple pie was good, but the honorable mention is the bread pudding. The Croissant on top of the bread pudding added a chewier texture to the whole dessert, and the addition of the peanut butter fudge with the usual vanilla sauce made for a very interesting flavoring. Definitely recommend this. (5/5)Overall was quite happy with lunch, and for those who do not want to go full-out and have a 3 course lunch, most of the ala carte selections are priced around $150-$200, and you can also just have the salad bar at $160 (approximate, cannot remember the price).

Would imagine to be a great hangover cure.- Salmon and dill linguine - amazing!! This was the dish that really impressed me as they really took their time into experimenting ways to improve this common dish. Loads of dill, lemongrass, GINGER; amazing combination, very flavorful. - Shakes - good, refreshing- Berry berry waffle - very fresh and generous dried mixed berry sauce; waffle - light, crispy, just the way i like it- Pork knuckle - ah, so-so; large portionSo excitedly I went again for a weekend brunch, but theres a huge difference in quality in the breakfast menu - - Toast was way too dry- Eggs over and easy were too overcooked- Sausage just tasteless- Eggs Royale on waffle - usually a great sucker for eggs benedict but this was a disappointment. The hollandaise sauce was tasteless!!! Hows that possible? Usually I find eggs benedict too rich in taste but I had to put in loads of salt and pepper to make this tolerable. The poached eggs - white part rather too firm; yolk was alright; sides was greatly disappointing, a plateful of tiny potato bits only. A little of them would be fine in the skillet, but alone they are too dry and tasteless, and rather difficult to fork together. Would recommend them to give us more side choices, and leave the tiny potatoes, not good. - Hot chocolate - AWFUL. I tried both the regular one and the macadamian nut one, both way to sweet to drink more than 2 sips. It's not chocolatey, it's just SWEET. A bit overpriced as drinks were not included in the breakfast set.Well, I'd still recommend this place for the good dishes, and all in all I can tell the owner really puts his/her heart into it.

Central,American,"0 I like this Starbucks shop which has been decorated like a cozy French bistro (complete with some ""outdoor"" seats, which are great for both work and chit-chat). And this is the first Starbucks outlet in Hong Kong to offer hot food items, apart from the usual fare you see in other Starbucks branches around town. Hot food selection 0Hot food selection All items are a la carte but there are ""Barista's Recommendations"" for some possible pairings of food and soup for example (sorry, no discounts for such combos). So I chose one of these combinations of Wild Mushroom Soup ($34) + Slow Roasted Vegetable Lasagna ($62) = $96. I made my order at the counter, picked my seat in the dining area, and the barista would bring me my order in a moment. No more crazy table-hunting with food and drinks in my hands!Dining area0Dining areaNice & Neat0Nice & NeatThe Wild Mushroom Soup was essentially cream of mushroom soup, but much better than the canned variety of course. Bursting with the aroma of mushrooms, yet warm and creamy, this soup, together with the complimentary Olive Bread was a delightful start of a hearty meal. 0As for the Slow Roasted Vegetable Lasagna, there were lots of refreshing veggies like spinach, zucchini and bell peppers layered between sheets of lasagna pasta. Topped with baked cheese and drizzled with a tomato basil sauce, the pasta was aromatic, wholesome, filling yet palate-pleasing. 1No visit to Starbucks is complete without a coffee. I rounded my meal up with a Espresso Macchiato ($15) which was a dab of milk foam more than the usual espresso shot. In the picture the foam had already sunken...but with such a slight hint the flavor of the coffee was not much affected.0Admittedly the price tags for the hot food items are a bit hefty (but still reasonable by Central standards), it seems that this Starbucks @ ifc has become an all-time favorite for the A-grade office workers nearby. One minor drawback though, the staff can often get too tied up to tidy up the tables due to the shop's popularity and high turnover rate of patrons.",Starbucks Coffee,3.7,114,nan,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-starbucks-coffee/49539?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

Central,American,"I bought a $40 worth of cash coupon at $20 from a groupon website months ago, but have always lacked the opportunity to actually redeem the coupon and enjoy the discount of 50%. after the 'small' lunch at Mak's noodles plus some walk up and down soho and central, we stopped at the Yoppi (at last) for a quick (and cheap) fix.the store was filled with foreigners when we arrived. i had to kinda 'compete' for space in front of the self-help yogurt outlets as two teenage girls moved around to squeeze hell lots of froyo into their already-too-full paper cups. i sampled with a little original (really tarty which is nice), rasberry (little sweeter than the original) and some strawberry (artificially pinkish and tastes awful) before i squeezed swirls of original and rasberry yogurt into my small cup.Then came step 2: the toppings. there was quite a large variety to choose from, but many of the dry toppings were not appealing to me - there were a large choice of breakfast cereals but many i dislike, and all you have for dried fruits are only raisins. the granola did not look appealing to me too, and there was nothing between oreo powder and coarsely crushed oreo wedges - if only there were less fine oreo crumbs!  luckily there were the sesame powder and peanut crunches which i really like. The choice of fruits was also wide - they look promisingly fresh and sweet - and we had some blueberries, mango and banana slices (the bananas look freshly cut as they had not been darkened by oxidation). I also spotted the mochis which (i guess) came in original, green apple, orange and strawberry, and i picked the first three flavours. If you were a fan of fruity syrups, there were also a few syrups which you can garnish your hearty cup with.Step 3 - weight and pay. We had a little more than 9 oz and only had to pay $1 extra - that means the heap of froyo with toppings in front of us cost only $21! a bargain indeed. the tarty yogurt and chewy mochis0the tarty yogurt and chewy mochis A short comment on the froyo- i really love how the original flavour is sour here cus what's being served at Milky Cow, the #1 store i ALWAYS go to, is way too sweet. I have told the lady there for numerous times about the sweetness of their base but it seems that nothing has been changed since day 1 of its opening. Afterall, its yogurt they are serving, and yogurt are supposed to be sour, at least. it has to be refreshing and light, and i see no point in having something as milky and heavy as ice creams for snacks or a reducing lunch.The fruits were juicy, sweet and fresh. Really nice. The skin of the blueberries were a little tough however, but they were already good enough, being big and fleshy.Sesame powder and peanut crunches varied the soft and smooth texture of the froyo, bringing in an oriental aroma and taste to the snack from the west. And i really love the mochi - they were chewy but not too tough, and were really tasty, since most mochis are as tasteless as plastic cubes.  this is something different - and the mochis of different flavours actually DID have different tastes. yum yum. the environment was also quite comfortable with all the sofas and chairs and stuff. But one little thing that worth commenting is that i notice the yogurt were melting and dripping from the machines, and the rasperry yogurt was halfway melted when i squeezed..quite scary and unhygienic indeed. but apart from this minor issue everything is cool and nice - sour froyo, fresh toppings, and really lovely sesame powder. i will come again for sure-even if i no longer have the 50% off coupon and have to pay the full fare!",Yoppi,4.6,11,nan,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-yoppi/48737?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

Originally they had anchovies inside the salad but I do not like anchovies so I asked if I could have portobello mushrooms instead. They allowed the change, without charging me additional.  Great!Romaine hearts were crisp, sweet, cold and fresh. No unwanted, wilted, stringy chunks. The salad bowl itself was chilled - came out of the freezer or something. The croutons were solid, not very crunchy, but flavorful (which i appreciate). Grilled chicken was subpar  - tasted kind of weird without dressing. I wouldn't call the chicken tender...but it wasn't too rough. Don't underestimate this bowl of leaves. It will leave you full and satisfied after the lunch. Unexpectedly satisfied. I'm a big eater - so i'm sure all the fit and thin office ladies out there with bird appetites will find this salad too filling. Another tip - eat slowly.

Fresh homemade onion soup was a highlight  which nearly slipped under my radar until recommended to me by one of the waiters. Seriously deep, sweet caramelised onion flavours with a nice hit of black pepper warmth really hit the mark. The pork sandwiches arrived with pork pilled high. The side of chips was a little disappointing, but that was my own fault (I was expecting English chips  i.e. fries  thatll teach me to read the menu properly). A thick, warm, tangy, smoky BBQ sauce was provided separately. The sandwich was tasty and comforting  the pork delightfully tender as youd expect from the slow cooking process.I skipped the dessert buffet, but my wife tucked in and seemed to thoroughly enjoy herself.The food was good. But what elevated the experience from good lunch, to bloody good lunch was the actions of the team in the kitchen and working the tables. Granted, the place wasnt particularly busy. But the service was really, really, good. I would have missed a seriously good soup (and onion soup is a personal favourite!) had the waiter not pointed out that it was delicious (and he was right) and freshly made that day. The chef popped out to say hi and to let us know that if we needed anything for the little one we should just ask. Another chap went on a mission to find a new highchair (I suspect down to Bistecca  same restaurant group, different floor) as the one originally provided had no strap. These friendly touches are hard to find in Hong Kong, in my experience, and cost the restaurant practically nothing. Last, there was the waitress, Noola. Eating out with young kids can be a joy or a major headache. This particular day, the boy (while in a jolly mood) was bouncing around like Zebedee. Seeing that we were finding it increasingly difficult to avoid spilling BBQ sauce over ourselves as we attempted to simultaneously eat and keep our hyperactive little rug rat entertained, she kindly offered to take him off our hands for a few minutes for a tour of the dining room. Of course, we enthusiastically accepted and were able to just sit and enjoy our food for ten minutes. The little man was in his element, flirting with anyone and everyone that paid him attention. This is a prime example of taking service to another level and, frankly, guarantees that my family and I will return  and probably take our friends.",Blue Smoke Bar-B-Que,nan,150,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-blue-smoke-bar-b-que/45983?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw
Central,American,"Heard about this new bagel and froyo place from a friend and decided to try it at lunch today.  The shop is near Cosco Tower and the bright organge signage makes it hard to miss.There is a choice of 4 bagels (Original, All-in-one, Onion and Cinnamaon & Raisin) and about 9 different spreads(original cream cheese, smoked salmon, roasted garlic, blueberry etc.  I was told they are low fat spreads).  Toppings include gammon ham, turkey, smoked almon and Italian style bruschetta.  You could either choose your own bagel + spread+ toppings combination or go for a pre-designed combo.  I went for an All-in-one bagel + bruschetta and my friend had ""Santa's Diet"" (Turkey + strawberry spread + original bagel).  The bagels were sliced and toasted fresh upon ordering.  They were crispy on the outside and chewy inside - just as a bagel should be.  They were also very generous with the spreads and toppings.  There was only one person making the bagels so you had to wait a while but it was worth the wait.They also serve fresh fruit smoothies but I had my heart set on froyo so I gave the smoothies a miss! They charge by weight and have a variety of toppings including many types of fresh fruits, granola, cocopops, digestive biscuits, red bean paste and cranberries etc.  They also had home-made mochis (green tea, strawberry, chocolate and original) which looked good although I was full from the bagel so I did not end up having any toppings.  The froyo was very good - tangy  and smooth.All in all, a very healthy and filling lunch. Service was great although when more people discover this little shop and it starts filling up it may need to increase its shop staff.",Sloop Froyo & Bagel,4.1,60,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-sloop-froyo-bagel/48301?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw
Central,American,"This is my third time here, but I didn't mind at all. My previous two visits were good enough to warrant another visit, and this time I brought three hungry dining companions! ""steak and egg hash skillet"" ($8x)mushroom, onions, peppers, potatoes, chopped medium well steak and a poached eggthere was quite a lot of steak cubes in this. my friend proceeded to down the entire thing as well. ""country skillet with sausage"" ($7x)peppers, onions, potato cubes, tomatoes, chopped sausage and two poached eggsdefinitely for potato-lovers. not a lot of sausage, so a fairly meatless dish. the poached eggs cooked perfectly and the onions + peppers were sweet and tender. seasoned very well as a whole, yumm..""Pit beef sandwich"" ($68)salad, fries, roast beef and cheese sandwiched between a burger bunthis was my order. the salad was not fresh at all- tip of the leaves were greying and didn't have the usual brightness in fresh mesclun mix. beef sandwich wasn't huge (size of a double cheeseburger from HK Mc.D's) but actually really filling, the beef was surprisingly moist and perhaps even 'juicy'. the cheese sauce could have been better, perhaps using a deli swiss cheese? the bun could also be lighter - it was small and dense. ""chicken and waffles"" ($70)probably my favourite of the four savoury dishes we ordered today. chicken drumsticks were cooked so well! tender chicken meat on inside and crispy crunchy brown coating....lovely! waffle was an original flavour, light and crisp like how it should be. ""bananas foster waffle"" ($52) original waffle, dollop of cream, choice of chocolate ice cream,  chocolate sauce, sliced banana, cinnamon, golden syrup this was a champion combination - the three of us love cinnamon so this dessert was naturally a winner for us. waffle was crisp and light as always, chocolate ice cream was not bad (we could've chosen movenpick), and the bananas were tender and sweetened by the syrup and cinnamon. my only complaint would be the presentation of the bananas, and perhaps real whipped cream would've went better with the waffles (like the really light cream in cafe causette!). otherwise, a must-order if you love cinnamon! Also worth mentioning were the fact that the unfriendly waitresses last time were not present this day, and instead there were two friendly waiters. however, they failed to serve water again...until we asked and even gave us hot water because they ran out of cold!original post: http://gastronomerr.blogspot.com/2010/09/green-waffle-diner-ii.htmlpit beef sandwich0pit beef sandwichbananas foster waffle0bananas foster waffle",Green Waffle Diner,3.6,100,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-green-waffle-diner/46305?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw
Central,American,"the flavour of the day is-cheesecake and blueberry. not being a fan of blueberries, i asked for a sample of cheesecake yogurt for try. it tasted quite cheesy, so i decided to go for a large cheesecake+euro tart with chalva and mochi as toppings.the portion was huge as usual, with two small heaps of froyo rising above the yogurt pot! the cheesecake froyo was sweet with a hint of cheese flavour in it. being yellowish in appearance, it was also more icy and hard than the original euro tart flavour, which by comparison was a lot more sour but softer in texture. both went well with my choices of toppings tho, the chalva and mochi-with mochi being one of the best in town. this actually got its own flavour in it while others are just tastelessly chewy.anyways, it was comfortable to sit and eat in this froyo joint. but one thing i really have to complain about is its price-at $38 for a large froyo, it is indeed a bit too expensive!0",Yogurtime,3.7,38,nan,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-yogurtime/31831?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
Central,American,"Again, the adventurous duo (that is my beautiful girlfriend and I) went off to Central on a mini-food tour.With less than $150 between us, we set off on the escalators, going all the way to the top, hoping to find something interesting to snack on.  We crossed by Lebanese restaurants, Pizza Express, Yorkshire pudding and a bunch of other fabulously intriguing restaurants, but we couldn't afford any of them. She noticed Gourmet burgers for $48 on the window of GBU, so we decided to 'check it out'.  Having nothing particularly that we were craving for except for some comfort food, we ordered a Southern Swine and a Double Truffle Burger.It took longer than we expected for it to come, but looking at the product, it was worth the wait.  Really, it was a scrunched up, dirty, sloppy burger - exactly what a burger should be.Took a bite.  wahhhhhh so salty.  Took another bite. Still salty, but this time, I could taste the flavors meshing together - the bacon and the rocket worked together amazingly with the bbq sauce.  I never thought rocket would do so well in a burger.  Her Double Truffle Burger was nice as well - the truffle cream had almost no hint of truffle in it, but it meshed well with the patty.All in all it was okay.Too bad we had no money for cheese fries.",Gourmet Burger Union,2.8,58,12,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-gourmet-burger-union/25302?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

First bite and I found the beef patty is only half the thickness from last time I tried!!!  Less than 1cm thick and although it's pink inside but it's just too little!!  Even McDonald's Quarter Pounder has thicker beef patty, $46 for a burger like this?  Definitely I will not go there again!!!!!!!

I'm not sure I was eating beef or not ...sigh.....forget it manThe fries just the taste it suppose to be, monster burger's fries is much better (I ate some from my colleagues' )Two additional things are their floor is extremely slippy, I was like sliding instead of walking there XDThen the waitress came 3 times asked us what did we ordered...are they out of their mind or something?

Central,American,"I saw this restaurant when i went home the other day, and then saw the magazine review on it, so i decided to try it out on Saturday. I was full of expectations, when the time time we arrived, luckily, we didn't have to wait, and there was a table for 2 of us.We got the menu, still have expectations on it, we ordered the berry waffles delight, and strawberry rhubarb compote waffles, for drinks, we have the blueberry and apple smoothies and iced latte.Still excited about the restaurant, but after a while we waited for the food and drinks to come, i start to realize how slow the service was. And only 2 people serving and preparing drinks. While we waiting for our drinks, I saw a fly flying all over the place, it even stays on the drinks just prepared by the woman in charge, I was so shocked and i just can;t imagine if that drink is for me. After 15-20 mins, my drink finally arrived, but my friend still waiting for the iced latte. The smoothie turned out to be lots of ice with a tiny bit of blueberry and apple juice, i never tasted such a thing and its called smoothie, i can never imagine that. I cancelled the drink as it was totally a scam. The woman in charge kept telling me that she hasn't added any sugar while the shops out there, they all have sugars, blah blah blahI just wanted to say its not about the sweetness or whatever, and I have had smoothies for so long and so many times, i have never tasted such thing and it could be called smoothie, it was the taste itself, its just like drinking iced water and nothing much more than that. It was really a mistake. I saw how she made the drinks, she put so much ice and a little bit of juices or whatever, i could see how stingy she is..probably she is the owner.After a while, the iced latte also arrived, it tasted OK, as usual, so my friend was OK with thatThen waited for another 20 mins or so, the woman in charge came over and told us that they ran out of rhubarb, and asked us to pick another dish for free, come on, why would you take our order when you ran out of stuff, and after we waited for like 40 mins, they came and said they don't have that, i just can't imagine that, it never happened to me. Anyway, we decided to order the same thing, and she promised to serve in few minutes, so we jsut waited.Finally, the food arrived, i could say the waffles tasted nothing special, as it's just the waffles that you could have in any other waffles place, they are all crunchy on the outside and soft in the inside, it's pretty standard. And i ordered the green one, but it doesn't got the pandan taste at all. And the waffles weren't hot either when they came to the table. What a big disappointment for our lunch today.Anyway, I would not come back again for a second visit as it really disappinted me at this first try-out. And i wouldn't recommend it to anyone else either.",Green Waffle Diner,2.8,50,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-green-waffle-diner/46305?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

Central,American,"Finally, some pizza place we can go to other than Pizza Hut.Getting a seat for 3 on weekdays, at peak lunch hour (1-2pm), is an absolute nightmare, despite making an advance booking. But, oh well, that's life in Central...The three of us ordered a set lunch each, to share (we figured ordering set lunch would speed up processes, and it surely did). Appetizers...Mediterranian Chicken SaladI am not sure which part of it is mediteranian...does adding a few chick peas make things Medit? Guess not...but nevertheless, it was quite a hearty salad. It has spiced chicken, assorted vegetables, peppers, mushrooms and chickpeas in light olive oil dressing.Rock Lobster SoupA tad fishy, needs a bit more flavor, it has a couple of clams, a mussel and a shrimp. The shrimp was wonderfully springy, other than that, it's pretty unmemorable. I'd choose something else next timeBuffalo Wings and MojoI thought the seasonings on both the chicken wings and mojo were delightfully tasty...I didn't realize that the chicken wings were supposed to be ""buffalo"". It was served with a creamy dressing, and there's nothing buffalo-ish at all. They were tasty nonetheless, good enough, I am convinced to try their fried chicken next time ;)MainsBBQ Pizza (thin crust)The crust is nice and crispy with meaty toppings and generous amount of melted cheese. It's decentChicken Scallopini with mushroom risottoChicken's tender and flavorful, the skin could be crispier, served with generous portion of mushroom risotto. The texture of the risotto is fine, al dente, but it could be way more flavorful and it could use much more mushrooms. Baby back ribs with mashed potatoesThe highlight of the whole lunch. The meat on the ribs was tender and juicy, the top of the ribs were beautifully charred, slather more BBQ sauce on it (served on the side), and enjoy. They're lip smacking delicious! The mashed potatoes could be more creamy...but it was decent.We'll totally go back next time, maybe for an early dinner Mediterranean Chicken Salad0Mediterranean Chicken SaladBuffalo Chicken Wings & Famous Mojo0Buffalo Chicken Wings & Famous MojoRock Lobster Soup0Rock Lobster SoupBBQ Pizza0BBQ PizzaBaby Back Ribs0Baby Back RibsChicken Scallopini with Mushroom Risotto1Chicken Scallopini with Mushroom Risotto",Shakey's Pizza Restaurant,nan,80,30,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-shakeys-pizza-restaurant/34688?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw
Central,American,"So officially I've been to Liberty Exchange twice. Once for dinner about 2 weeks ago and also the other day for lunch. I specifically went back mainly because: 1) I liked their burger quite a lot2) I didn't bring my camera last timeEnvironment: On both occasions I sat upstairs which was comfortable and spacious. I quite like their modern decor. I highly recommend sitting upstairs over sitting downstairs where it's more cramped, more dimly lit and also noisier due to its proximity to the bar. Service: One thing that immediately noticed was the high number of Caucasian waitstaff at Liberty Exchange. That is definitely unusual for a Hong Kong restaurant. The strange thing is the contrast between the Caucasian staff and the other extremely local waitstaff. Either way, the waitstaff was attentive and friendly. Food came out quickly and there were no mixups. For my dinner experience I shared the following with friends:  House-made sausage - The sausages came in hot Italian, herb and sweet andouille. My favorite of the 3 came was the hot Italian mainly because the taste was the most intense and reminded me of salami. The other 2 sausages tasted quite average. Portion size was a little on the small side for $98. Decent. Mussels with Tomato and Basil Broth - This was quite nice. The mussels tasted quite fresh and the sweetness from the broth complimented it well. I can't tell you the number of overcooked mussels I have been served in Hong Kong so this was a nice change. The mussels came with a side order of fries (not sure what makes these 2 items go together) but the fries were good as well. Nothing fancy...just crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Nice.  Peanut Butter & Jelly Sandwich - This is a gourmet version is with foie gras. Portion size was very small relative to the other 2 appetizers. Basically it was a deconstruction of a PB&J by having a piece of foie gras sitting on top of a miniature french toast-like cube with reduced raspberry sauce drizzled around. When you eat everything together it gives you the flavor profile of a PB&J. Not bad but I didn't think this was good value for money.  Eight-hour French Onion Soup - I had read online beforehand that its consistency was like gravy which sounded quite interesting. Although at the restaurant I felt this was very similar to normal onion soup. It was pretty tasty but not really any different from the onion soups I could potentially get at Dan Ryans or some other American restaurant.  Liberty Burger With Mushroom and Cheese- Now this I liked! Flavor wise it was juicy and really beefy. The onion marmalade also provided a nice hint of sweetness. The use of sourdough bread was also a nice touch. I found out later the beef patty is actually made with short rib which probably explains why the texture/density felt kind of 'loose' and not as dense as a regular patty. Feels a little like eating a beef sandwich than a burger but this is a good burger.  BBQ Ribs - This was HUGE. As someone correctly described it online...it looked Fred Flintstone size...haha. Ribs overall were quite nice and tasty. Came off the bone quite easy (bone was close to the length of my forearm) which shows that they had been cooking it slowly for some time. If there's a minor criticism I can make of it is that the meat felt a little 'stringy'. Pretty good.  Pigs and Apples - Read a lot of good reviews about this but sadly ours was overcooked. The minute I put my knife into it I knew this was going to be on the tough side. Flavor profile wise this has potential with the caramelized apples. So sad this dish wasn't executed properly.  Chicken and Waffles - Another dish I looked forward too but was let down. The chicken was definitely on the dry side. Taste was decent but it's just so hard for this dish to recover once the chicken is overcooked. The waffles...were quite pancake-like and floppy which wasn't too my liking. If you want to get good chicken and waffles in Central I suggest giving Green Waffle Diner a go.  Granny Smith Crumble Tart - The crunchiness from the filo dough was nice and I also liked stewed apples inside the tart. Maybe a bit too sweet for my personal tastes but I thought this was a pretty decent dessert.  Charlie Brown - Highly simple but successful dessert in my opinion. The brownie was warm, 'chocolaty' and fudgy which was a nice contrast to the cold ice cream. Best dessert of the night.  Strawberry Shortcake - This came in a cone like cup. Not bad...just didn't really stand out per say. Shortcake provided a nice crunch against the strawberries and cream.  Decent.  My opinion of dinner is there were a few standouts (mussels & burger) but I was expecting more with that kind of a price tag (we paid about $500 each). Honestly speaking, if they hadn't overcooked the pork and also the fried chicken this meal would have been a lot more enjoyable. So after about 2 weeks I went back the other day for lunch since I didn't bring my camera last time. Here is what we ordered (both are set lunches): Mussels With Creamy Fennel Vermouth Broth: Not bad. Flavor was quite subtle and light for a creamy based sauce. Mussels were nicely cooked but I personally preferred the tomato and basil pairing versus this one. The fries were nice but again I'm not sure why they paired mussels with fries. Liberty Burger With Mushrooms and Cheese: I was quite disappointed. The burger felt a little overcook (a little dry) and also it didn't come out at optimal temperature. I understand I took about 20-30 seconds shooting photos but the burger should still be quite hot (which it was not). The burger still tasted pretty decent but the temperature kind of ruined it for me. The fries similar to last time was crunchy and tasty. The set lunches also came with an appetizer and we picked the smoked salmon salad and also a grilled calamari with a chipotle sauce. The chipotle sauce was nice but the actual dishes were quite average and didn't stand out. The calamari was also a little on the tough side. My lunch experience was disappointing and considering it costs us over $200 each I would say this further says to me that Liberty Exchange is overpriced for the food it puts out.  So my overall conclusion is if you go to Liberty Exchange go there for dinner. Get the burger, the mussels, the Charlie Brown and maybe the ribs. Expect to overpay but if they execute the food properly that night I still think it could be an enjoyable meal.

Central,American,"I hadn't seen E in a while and it was time to catch up over good food. Now E loves breakfast foods so when I suggested Green Waffle and its concept, she was damn excited. Reservations were never needed for my previous visits here during dinner, but I made reservations in case. When I arrived the small-ish diner was three-quarters full on a Thursday lunch... a good sign? Here they have a very reasonably-priced lunch set menu which includes a main and a dessert (half a waffle with a scoop of ice cream). But since nothing on the set lunch menu enticed us (green apple compote with waffle and sausage?!) we opted for their simpler items on the menu. We decided on a breakfast of seared vine tomatoes with scrambled eggs and a whole-wheat waffle (instead of the normal toast) ($44 + 9 for the upgrade), and a buckwheat waffle with blueberries and cinnamon sugar.The scrambled eggs here were quite good - creamy and slightly runny lovely! The seared vine tomatoes (my favourite kind) were really sweet and juicy albeit slightly undercooked for my liking. A little more time on the grill or pan would have made it better and less hard in texture. The whole wheat waffle upgrade was Es idea. Not a bad one either. There was a strong presence of that wheat taste, similar to 100% whole wheat bread, but the texture was maintained at a light and airy form  delicious with a little maple syrup complimentary from Green Waffle.The next plate of buckwheat waffles with blueberries was sprinkled with the right amount of cinnamon sugar to give it the divine aroma that the cinnamon-addict in me lusts after. In hindsight I probably should have ordered something that was pre-set rather than create-your-own since this relatively simple and small plate ended up costing $51 (not that it is expensive for Soho, but compared to the previous huge plate of food!). Anyway, the buckwheat waffle itself, I would think, is closer in taste to the original plain ones, but didnt have that airy texture here =((. Blueberries were fresh but more couldve been provided as it looked quite dull on the plateA good lunch anyhow, and will definitely return for more breakfast items or whenever a waffle craving kicks in!00",Green Waffle Diner,3.3,60,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-green-waffle-diner/46305?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

Central,American,So today I had a lazy Sunday brunch with one of my buddies. We suggested Green Waffle Diner since I have yet to try their fried chicken. Wow...the place was packed today for brunch. Last time I came here the place was pretty empty but after a slew of good reviews and articles in newspapers/magazines it seems like this neighborhood place has blown up in terms of popularity. My suggestion is if you want to come Sunday during brunch time...make a reservation.Environment: The place is definitely on the cozy side but I didn't feel cramped even with the place packed. After a 15 minute wait the 2 of us got a 4 person table so we had lots of room. I just love brightly lighted places (good for food photography!) and Green Waffle Diner satisfies that. Service: With this sudden increase in popularity it looks like the servers were significantly more busy. Food came out at a decent pace but I definitely could feel that they were strained in terms of staff. Talked with the owner for a while and he said his kitchen wasn't prepared to handle this many people so they're just trying their best to keep up. Overall service is still very friendly but I can imagine on busy days that the chances of them forgetting orders/making mistakes will increase. Food: I specifically came back today to try their signature fried chicken that my friends were raving about.  Country Fried Skillet - Quite a hearty dish and I liked how my buddy broke open the egg yolk to mix in with the potatoes giving them a more 'creamy' texture. Maybe a little heavy handed for me in terms of salt (I eat quite clean so a lot of people may not agree with me). My personal opinion is if the potatoes were more crunchy the contrast texturally might be better. No major wow factor but this was an enjoyable dish. Plain Waffle With Maple Syrup - Like last time I agree this is a solid waffle. Although they offer many waffles combinations with fruits or ice cream I personally prefer it just plain with a bit of maple syrup. It's not easy to produce a waffle that is crispy on the outside while somewhat soft in the inside and in this regard I think Green Waffle has done a good job. Also nice that you can taste that hint of 'egginess'. My only gripe is with the increase in customers they should try harder to serve the waffles hot to piping hot. It's still a good waffle when warm but I think it would be better if it was hotter.  Fried Chicken Meal - Now onto the star of the meal! When it first came out I was pretty shocked since the drumsticks were huge for HK standards. First bite into them was very nice. The exterior was crispy (they use a corn flake batter) with a bit of heat/kick (I'm told there is mustard) while the drumstick itself was really moist. Bit of a mess to eat since the crust was falling all over the table but considering I was using my hands to wolf down a giant drumstick...I didn't care...haha! Yum! The secret behind the chicken? I heard through the grapevine that they actually use a double preparation method for their chicken. After brining the drumsticks the night before they sous vide (means they cook it in a vacuum bag in constant low temperature water) first to make sure the chicken is properly cooked and juicy. After that they dip it in the batter and flash fry it to achieve that crispy exterior. This is probably a different approach relative to fried chicken places in the US but the bottom line is...it works. As to where they get local drumsticks so big...I'm told it is top secret...haha. Is it the best fried chicken in HK? I'm not sure I can say that but the fried chicken here is definitely tasty. Overall a very satisfying and reasonably priced brunch. I will definitely be returning for their fried chicken when I get that fried chicken itch. Hopefully with it's recent rise in popularity Green Waffle Diner won't take a dip in terms of quality and service.

Central,American,"Seeing Jason Bonvivant's post on this place, and being a huge fried chicken and waffle fan, I had to give this place a try.We went there one lunch time, ordered two lunch sets, which came with half a portion of sweet waffle each, and half a dozen of chicken wings.The fried chicken lunch set...love love LOVE the fried chicken. Very flavorful, tender and juicy meat with crispy and tasty batter. Yum! The mashed potatoes could be a bit creamier and tastier, it was rather bland. The coleslaw was ok and refreshing for the hot weather, but definitely could use an extra kick!The sandwich, it looks gorgeous, but the layers of meat...a bit too dry.SInce we love the fried chicken, and the chicken wings were done pretty much the same way...they were delicious! Juicy and tasty. The buffalo sauce could be a little spicier, but overall, yum!The waffles were ok, a tad too dry, and it would be nice if there was more sauce or ice cream which I could soak my waffles with. Next time I'll try their sweet waffles, not the ones served with lunch sets.The lychee cooler was really nice and refreshing, the perfect thirst quencher for a sizzling hot summer day. http://mochachocolatarita.blogspot.comYummy fried chicken0Yummy fried chickenYummy Chicken wings!0Yummy Chicken wings!Sandwich, a bit dry :(0Sandwich, a bit dry :(Waffle served with lunch set, a bit dry0Waffle served with lunch set, a bit dry",Green Waffle Diner,nan,80,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-green-waffle-diner/46305?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw
Central,American,"I came here today for a quick lunch before heading back to work. The area is quite secluded, but the sign hanging outside was quite large and I was able to find my way there with no problems at all. The restaurant itself is quite small with only three tables for groups and two bar tables.When ordering my burger, the man behind the counter was very nice and asked what I wanted, if I wanted a combo, etc. with a good attitude and a pleasing demeanor - I was quite impressed as I wasn't expecting that at a burger joint. I ordered the Guitar Shop Special, just the burger, since I am only one small person and I didn't want to be overwhelmed with food. Guitar Shop Special ($65)Wow. This burger was really hard to put in my mouth as it was such a thick size! The burger was almost overflowing (that's a good thing) from all of the ingredients stuffed inside. The bun was toasted, but slightly soft when it came to me. The burger was very thick; a bit too well done, but still extremely beefy and juicy. The onions and mushroom gave a great caramelized, smokey flavor whilst the cheese gave a slight tang. I would have preferred slightly more cheese on my burger, though.Overall, the burger was really great, although there are some minor improvements that could be made to it. The service was slightly slow considering the lack of customers in the restaurant but also very nice. The price is quite high, but quality is also great.

Central,American,"Had a great brunch at this diner today. We ordered the 'steak and egg hash skillet', 'sunshine breakfast' and several waffles to share.   The smoothies are also very fresh, they used fresh fruits for the blend, I liked the 'mood maker' which was made with fresh blueberries.  All the hot dishes were well prepared and in generous portions we nearly didn't have room for the waffles.    I definitely want to try the sandwiches next time so I can fit in more waffles. Now the main focus should be the waffles!!! I love waffles and honestly these are the best waffles I've had in HK.  First, we tried the 'caramel apple waffle crunch' -- it also came with a scoop of ice cream.  The waffles are freshly made (the chef said they make a new batch every 2 hours), the flavour is just right, crunchy and not hard, and the texture is just right!    I also got to try their special waffle with white chocolate chips and that was utterly awesome... don't even need any toppings and its perfect.  entrance0entranceCountry Skillet0Country SkilletSunshine Breakfast0Sunshine BreakfastSteak and Egg Hash Skillet0Steak and Egg Hash SkilletMood Maker0Mood MakerCaramel Apple Waffle Crunch0Caramel Apple Waffle Crunchplain waffle with white chocolate chips0plain waffle with white chocolate chips",Green Waffle Diner,nan,100,nan,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-green-waffle-diner/46305?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw
Central,American,"I have been to this restaurant quite a few times as I used to be addicted to their French Onion Soup (one of the most delicious ones I've tasted). I cannot believe that this restaurant would get so many negative comments as I have always loved this restaurant. However, I have only come during lunchtime and never for dinner. From what I can tell, the lunch is more expensive than other sets in Soho, but it is also much nicer in both presentation, taste and atmosphere.The restaurant is decorated very nicely with barn doors and mirrors to make it appear more spacious. It is very clean and hygienic and has a high-class look. The service is polite, nice and quite fast (at that time, there were only three tables with customers). Warm Mushroom and Spinach SaladThis dish was quite delicious, although it is hard to get it wrong. The spinach is fresh and plentiful, while the mushrooms tasted great, very juicy. There are also some slices of roasted peppers that worked very well with the rest of the dish. There was also a sauce, which although I cannot remember what it was, I can remember it had a slightly tangy taste to it. Craftsteak BurgerA very large burger! Be sure you are hungry when you order this dish (I was!). The bun was nicely toasted on the grill (as seen by the char marks). The actual beef itself was very juicy and a considerable amount, so I think it is worth the money. The bacon added a smokey flavor while the Swiss cheese mellowed the dish out. The only problem was that there was no way to eat the burger in one bite like that, so I had to split it in half to fit it in my mouth. However, I must say, this burger was very delicious and worth the calories. Pecan Pie with Maple Ice CreamThe pecan pie is served cold, which I didn't like as much. I prefer warm desserts, but I have never eaten pecan pie before and am unsure whether it should be served warm or cold. Nevertheless, it tasted very nice; the pecans were crunchy and sweet while the bottom layer was smooth, creamy and buttery. I did not really enjoy the crust as it was too 'buttery' and left a too-rich feeling in my mouth. The maple ice cream was delicious, although I would have preferred a stronger maple flavor.Overall, I believe Craftsteak is one of Soho's most excellent restaurants and, despite the bad claims, one must give it a try. As most people seem to have problems during dinnertime, I would suggest coming for lunch if possible.",Craftsteak,4.5,98,nan,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-craftsteak/16648?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

Central,American,"I love the concept of this burger shack, I really do, you've got your risque burger names laced with innuendo and tongue in cheek signage adorning the walls. As for the burgers themselves - not so much. Neither did I fancy the less than friendly attitude by the female waitstaff taking my order, who kind of glared at me when I placed my order. I had the cheeseburger combo (I was not about to pronounce that silly name they have on the menu for it) and apparently, it's now at a heavily discounted price of $52 for the combo which includes some very average fries of the skinless, machine generated frozen variety and a can of pop. I was also aggrieved by the fact that the cashier did not allow me to select cherry Coke, claiming that such was not allowed. It puzzles me since I thought all pop were created equal. Anyways, I did appreciate the quaint decor for this place, I found the wooden pub theme soothing with its dark walls and cramped booths overlooking Wellington street below. Now onto the burger, visually, it was stunning and beautiful to look at with an inch thick patty between vibrant veggies of tomato and lettuce. Gastronomically, not so much. My biggest gripe had been the patty which was to be honest, a little gross, it was soft and mushy with a texture akin to that of a soggy meatloaf, and not that of a tight patty. The problem seems to be from the overload of onions they had inserted into their patty mixture, the overload of onions made the whole patty literally fall apart upon sinking one's teeth into it and had a strong onion aroma. It was moist alright, but not juicy with beef flavour - all I could taste was the distracting onion mush within. The patty was nowhere dense enough, and I struggled to finish the burger. The garlic mayo I thought was a nice touch, but other than that, shake em' buns had been more like a kick in the booty for me. Suffice it to say, I would not be returning.",Shake'em Buns,2.3,52,nan,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-shakeem-buns/20855?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

Central,American,"I used to be a fan of Dressed salad until I tried this place.  Although Dressed is more convenient for me, the quality of the food at Just really makes the longer walk worthwhile.   I was so happy when I heard about their new store in World-wide House cos I no longer have to walk all the way up the escalator in the heat Anyway, I felt like having something light today after a few big meals over the weekend, so I ordered my usual 'Custom salad' - 1 green + 4 toppings (2 more toppings if you bring your own Just salad bowl) for $49 Green: Mesclun + Romaine (You can always mix the greens) Toppings:  Asparagus, Beets, Egg whites, White Mushrooms, Artichoke Hearts, Cherry tomatoes and Tuna (extra $10) Dressing: Honey DijonIt was as good as expected.  The only thing I didn't like was the artichoke hearts, they didn't cut the outer layers properly, which made it v hard to chew.   For you meat-lovers and those who want more carb, they actually have a wide range of toppings for you to choose from.  And to be honest, $49 for a salad is a pretty good deal (esp. in Central).  I'd like to do a little comparison on the 2 competitors:Price & toppings Dressed: $58 for 1 Green + 4 Toppings; $48 for salad sandwiches wrapped in grilled flatbread; $35 for a bowl of soup ($25 with salad)  Just:  $49 for 1 Green + 4 Toppings (2 extra if you bring your own bowl); $45 for salad wraps (with a choice of Plain, Spinach, Basil Tomato & Whole wheat); $18 for a bowl of soupDressed is obvoiusly more expensive. I don't mind paying for the price if only the service and food quality are better as it is at a more convenient location.  They might have similar amount of toppings to choose from (around 70+), but you'll need to add extra $$ for quite a few of them.  (e.g. Artichoke hearts for an extra $4, Egg whites for an extra $8, Tofu for another $4 - why!? )  I've also noticed people at Dressed are quite stingy on the portions of toppings they give you, (It is probably because of their high rent )  whereas they really fill your bowl with toppings at Just!  I like how their greens (at Just) are so fresh they won't 'shrink' after being tossed with dressing.  I remember my bowl of Dressed salad sank so low it became half-full (or half empty if you like )I personally didn't like the asparagus at Dressed cos they were grilled, and tasted quite burnt.  The same applies to their grilled flatbread which comes with the salad.  It depends on your own tastes really.  I prefer the fresh piece of wheat bread that comes with the bowl of Just salad I won't comment on the soups at either restaurants cos they weren't very impressive, but again it's cheaper at Just.DressingsI love how Just salad catagorized their dressings into 5 different types:  Just salad originals, Just salad classics, Low fat, Fat free & Asian delight.  They also tell you whether that particular dressing is suitable for people with different diets.  Other than that, the types of dressings are quite different at the two restaurants, so it's rather difficult to comment on.Choices of designed saladsThe selections of designed salads are also quite different between the two.  Dressed salad have special promotions from time to time and their Japanese Lobster Salad was very nice.  They have a more 'traditional' selections - Caesar, Falafel, California, Cobb, Vegetable garden, The Club etc.Just also have Caesar and California, but their list of designed salads are not as 'commonly-known'.  So it really depends on your own liking.ServiceService at Just is definitely better.  They're a lot friendlier, more patient etc.. and at least the first thing they give you is a smile, not a cold 'What would you like'.  That, I might be biased, but I'm only speaking from experience. ** I love how the management of Just salad is aware of its corporate social responsibility and promotes environmental consciousness.

Central,American,"Don't you just love the ideas of trends coming and going -- Stockmarket trends fashion trends, food trends...etc. While thinking you can only go so far with the crunching numbers or the mixing and matching along the lines of the little black dress, food trends are more variant in terms of the type of change you can have...consider the quintessence of raw materials being prepared by a group of men and women in white chef's jackets -- in the kitchen that is. BURGERS, an American staple, has never gone out of style or off the culinary radar of many throughout the years. PRO-BURGER of Central, is joining many in the quest to revamp the ultimate classic for the American style of generosity.""Follow your nose"" is my advice locating Pro-Burger. The familiar smell of hot grease on hot plate will lead you to a tiny 5-seat joint, with kitchen occupying one side and stools on the other. No staff in freshly starched white uniform, (but they do wear baseball caps), but they are too busy multitasking between flipping burgers, toasting sesame-flecked buns and frying potato wedges. I heard of a burger with a 300+ gram patty. Upon seeing the picture, I was determined to try just exactly how PRO this burger joint could be.Staffing is adequate as orders crunch in the cash machines faster than the burger flipping acts -- char, flip, cover, and char some more. The clinking of the metal spatulas sounded slightly familiar with the Japanese Teppanyaki, only in a rather foreign rustic way. A promising splash of hot fat arise as potato wedges sink deep with a sizzle. When the wedges emerged again they have a golden brown coating, followed by an intoxicating aroma of starch fried in hot grease. The burger arrived promptly enough, so disproportionately large and dripping with fat, accompanied in the burger by crisp lettuce and deep red tomato slices. The halved burger, pictured here, is too large even for a grown adult like myself. The filling -- the center of the patty, was quiveringly rare with a moisture resembling a blue steak. Digging in, the patty was slightly than it should be, but the centre was moist. Each bite seemed laden with herbs like thyme and oregano. As I wondered what good dry herbs would make than fresh ones, I realized that my expectation was a pro burger was not entirely satisfied by the enormous burger. The herbs have overpowered the sheer intensity of essential beefiness in a burger, in a way as if the kitchen staff has misread the recipe mistaking ""pinch"" with ""punch"". Savoring the beef I realized that the crusty sesame buns could soak up the drizzling fat from the meat patty itself, despite they are crusty on their own. The lettuce, cheese and tomatoes are satisfactory.  While the burger itself was good but not great, the potato wedges were not forotten. The generosity part has stopped after the burger and the soda by the can (served with a cupful of ice and a slice of lemon). The potato wedges tasted strangely starchy somehow, and only faintly reminded me that they are not from a potato cut earlier but rather, somewhere in a paper bag in the deep freeze. The combo will fittingly fill up a hungry man with an enormous appetite and no doubt will Pro-Burger attracts a lot of folks curious enough to register with their carnivorous nature at some point.  Yet the burger itself , so enormous and out of proportion (not just the size, but the meat/seasoning proportions) was not so great. I think it deserves a visit if you have never been, and even better if you will ignore the part where the chef developing the burger is hotel-training, bearing in mind that it is not the ""training in 5 star hotel"" that makes the burger, but the meat itself.

Central,American,"For the past year, there are more and more burger joints opened in Hong Kong.  It is a good thing for me because I'm a burger lover.  I tried many burger joints Mostly are overpriced and I still don't have a favorite one.  The burger I like the most WAS from Ruby Tuesday.  It costs around $100.  Today, finally I find my favorite burger joint.  It calls (drum roll....) Pro-Burger.  In terms of food, value and location, Pro-Burger is the best one.  I went there for lunch today.  I ordered an 180g bacon cheese burger meal.  It is only $51 with a can of soda and fires.  As I remember, this should be the cheapest one in town amount all other burger joints.  The beef patty is very juicy with even amount of fat and lean ground beef.  It also mixed with different kind of species but they don't over power the taste of the beef.  However the bacon is not crispy at all.  They put mayonnaise instead of ketchup on the burger.  For me this is even better.  Again, it is only $51 for the set.  Very good value!Food and service are good in Pro-Burger.  However, they only have 6 seats.  The dinning environment is not as good as other burger joints. Pro-Burger is good for grabbing a quick food to go.  They don't have fancy menu, designer chairs, 15 choices of drinks or hot waitress.  This place is for burger and good burger only.  Well, I guess it is really well defined what is a burger joint  Good value burger.",Pro-Burger,4.2,51,nan,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-pro-burger/31145?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw
Central,American,"Four of us went to the restaurant at lunch time.  There are only 5 to 6 seats inside the shop and it was fully packed.  We ended up going to a local HK Da Pi Dong near by.  After the meal, we decided to give the burger a try.  We ordered one 360oz burger to share by four of us.  Really appreciated that the waitor cut the burger into 4 pieces for us. It was ok, but not juicy as expected.",Pro-Burger,nan,18,nan,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-pro-burger/31145?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
Central,American,"Tried another salad specialist in Central and so came for trying this one with a friend.  This shop is brightly decorated, giving us a sense of freshness and cleaniness.  Right, that's the right decor for a salad shop, which is supposed to be healthy and fresh.The custom salad is $58, i tried this in another shop, having the experience that the ingredients and most importantly, the dressing may not fit each other.  So this time i tried the Chef's specialty. I had Chicken Gordon Bleu and my friend had a Steak ceaser.  The queue was quite long and the servers seemed too busy to serve us quickly.  After waiting for several minutes, then i was served.We managed to secure two seats during peak lunch hour.  Lucky enough as there were lots of peoples there.  Seems that it's a favourite place for expats to have lunch together.Our salad finally arrived.  The plate was hugh.  But i guess it's no harm in having more veggies than our normal consumption.  The ingredients for my Chicken gordon bleu were chicken cubes, swiss cheese, portobello mushroom, ham and romaine lettuce in a buttermilk ranch.  They all went well together.  The romaine was very crispy and nice.  It would be better if the portobello and chicken cubes be a little bit larger, then it'd be better.  In fact, it's already up to my satisfaction.  Despite that it's $68 for just a salad, i think it's still worthwhile to come for further visit.",Dressed,nan,68,nan,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-dressed/26766?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
Central,American,"I went to the downtown to see my ex-colleague during the lunch hour.  Both of them bought me to triple o' in exchange square.  compare with wendy's or burger king, i love triple o's / white spot more because i was in canada during those 10 years while i was attending high school and university in vancouver.  there's no triple o's or white spot in seattle.  i have to drive for 2 hours to reach vancouver for a tirple o's burger.the classic triple o's sauce is amazing, much better than using mayo or x1000 island dressing ... etc.  i love it.  and will have one more sest before going back the state. 00",Triple O's by White Spot,4.5,56,nan,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-triple-os-by-white-spot/13767?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
Central,American,"I think this is one of the first high quality burgers emerged Hong Kong few years ago and as of today the standard still remain as high as its first presence.  I have been a big fan of ""White Spot"" since young back in the days in Canada.The ""Triple O"" sauce is as good as the one I used to have.  The Blueberry Milkshake is another favourite.  It's smooth and rich.  Once you try it, you'll fall in love with it.The only products I do not quite like is ""Chicken Strip"".  They are sometimes too overcooked even though the meat is still very tender inside but outside is too burnt.",Triple O's by White Spot,3.7,60,nan,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-triple-os-by-white-spot/13767?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw
Central,American,"Ever heard of ""Going Green"", lifestyle wise?!For some reason 2 new salad-joints are opening in Central alone. Coincidentally both are of American creation. DRESSED, now opened in IFC, and now, JUST SALAD along Cochrane Street. With a catchy grassy greenness throughout, JUST SALAD is a New York native. Nick Kenner and Rob Crespi, the owners of JUST SALAD, paired up with chef Laura Pensiero to develop its menu, with mix-and-match salad ingredients custom made in front of the customers. Introduced now to Hong Kong-ers, JUST SALAD is determined for HK-ers to create our own customized salads.The spot is of convenience, right by the corner of Cochrane Street and Lyndhurst Terrace, JUST SALAD occupied a two-storey space where the ground floor was nothing more than a salad counter and some space (for lining up, perhaps?!). Ordering is easy here. All you need is the staff walking you through the menu. You'll first choose a greens base (among Romaine, Mesclun, Iceberg and arugula), then you get to choose 4 other toppings for your salad. You will have no trouble going through the list. It's long, but with Chinese there shouldn't be any problem understanding. Do keep your eyes open for some 'unusual' ingredients like Grilled Portobello mushrooms, artichoke hearts, edamame, and butternut squash. JUST SALAD also has a thing for pulses and grains too. There are plenty of them in the toppings menu, like barley, couscous, and something called ""Goji Wolfberries"". Do not be alarmed by the strange name, Goji Wolfberries are somewhat like barley, but with a decided bite and a wheaty taste to it.I ordered my toppings and soon the ingredients were sent to the staff with a double-blade mezzaluna to chop up. You may think that the little plastic bucket of greens and toppings won't fill you up. But once the staff started rockin' the knife, voila! Your salad is ready with a drizzle of your vinaigrette of choice. My order happened to be mesclun mix, with portobello, artichoke hearts, edamame and Goji Wolfberries, and Sherry Shallot vinaigrette as dressing. The salad was packed into the lidded bucket of choice (the colours of choice are orange, green and white) . This entire salad costs $45. There are more toppings with extra charges on the menu should you feel you want a little touch of cheese, meat, or seafood in your salad. Don't forget to ask for bread, which comes complimentary with each salad. My salad turned out to be wonderfully crisp with a good flavour from the edamame. The portobello may look a little grey but fret nothing about it, the deep mushroom flavour will make it up. The Sherry Shallot vinaigrette is nothing like a mignonette sauce for oysters. In fact it's sweeter, and the vinegary taste is not as strong.Should you prefer someone else do make the decisions for you...Chef designed salads ($45 - $65) and wraps ($40 - $45) Be sure to keep the plastic bowl in case you plan to make next visits, as part of the eco-friendly menu, JUST SALAD is offering customers who bring their plastic bowl back 2 free toppings, as a token of thanks to help saving the planet...speaking of going green. Shouldn't we give it a try on tossed salads?! I myself will probably go back, to check out the now-renovating 2nd floor at the least! The salads are refreshingly sweet and crisp with a combination of textures. I gotta say though, eating more vegetables is a good habit, and why not start with a fresh introduction into the world of salads?Just Salad0Just SaladA bowl you can reuse.0A bowl you can reuse.Custom Made Salad ($45)0Custom Made Salad ($45)",Just Salad,3.6,45,nan,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-just-salad/26677?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
Central,American,"The poster looks really attractive and it's the first time that shrimps are used in burger.  At least in the very common fast food type burger.  So of course give it a try. The burger isnt as thick as it appears in the poster and also it's not a shrimp burger, it's a shrimp patty burger.  The patty is okay, it's quite similiar to those Japanese seafood cake, quite crunchy and the sauce matches with it quite nicely.  It's lovely with lettuce.  Overall speaking, it's quite okay, but since the patty is deep fried, so I'd rather only have it once in few weeks, as it's fattening.00",McDonald's,nan,20,nan,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-mcdonalds/20907?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
Central,American,"Having lived in NY and Philly, I really liked the concept of having a NY deli since there aren't that many alternatives in town aside from Main St Deli.  And to do this well is admittedly difficult especially for those of us who would compare this to their NY favorites.  But it is by this high standard that I judge Duke's Deli and they are quite far behind.  Admittedly, I have only tried their Philly cheese steak but I suspect the other food might be similar.Here is what I thought of the cheese steak.  I think they tried as pretty hard on getting a good product but it falls short since they don't really know what they are doing.  Ordered mine with onion and cheese and just the ordering was not a good start.  Sauteed onion almost always go with the steak but green peppers?  I have lived in Philly for many years and don't recall people ever serving a cheese steak with green peppers.  With a fajita, yes, but cheese steak, never.  They only serve one kind of cheese and I am used to at least having a choice of American, Provolone or cheese whiz.  Starting with the bread, they did toast it and it has a nice crunch to it.  This is nice though mine was a bit over-toasted.  The beef is cooked to order in front of you which is what every cheese steak place does.  The beef they have is quite nice and better than a lot of the crappy beef served in philly but what they got wrong was they didn't shred it to pieces as they cook it.  Need to do that or else the sandwhich is impossible to eat with meat hanging left and right.  They also put way too much onion in to the point of being an ""onion"" sandwhich.  They put the cheese on the beef while the beef is being cooked which is a nice touch but they missed the most important part!  They then try to put the beef onto the sandwhich!  What happens when you do this is you would wind up mixing the beef and the cheese and I wind up with half a sandwhich with a lot of cheese and half with none.  How is this a cheese steak?  You need to stick the bread on top of the steak and then scoop the whole thing up!  But oh well.  Overall, it is a so-so cheese steak and until they have some major improvements, I probably won't give it another shot.",Duke's Deli,nan,80,nan,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-dukes-deli/23646?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw
