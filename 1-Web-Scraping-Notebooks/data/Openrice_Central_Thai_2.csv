Central,Thai,"Came here for lunch on a weekday. We had a party of 4 and no reservation, so we actually had to wait for quite a while, around 30 minutes.The view here is quite good, and Id probably characterize that as the main draw of this place. You could come at night, though idk if youd be able to see as much. I got the massaman curry, which I thought might be spicy... but actually wasnt spicy at all. Anyways, the food was fine, but at 208 hkd, the portion was really small. What youre really paying for is the setting and the view, tbh. Anyway, some of my friends dishes were more substantial, and cheaper (such as the pho or the fried rice), so consider those when dining here.FYI there is a service charge.Lunch0Lunch",MARKET SEA,3.3,200,30,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-market-sea/558025?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
Central,Thai,"0There were diverse reviews on Aaharn, which made me unsure whether to try it out or not. But with Restaurant Week deal, its hard to say no! So here I am with my friend.0Located inside Tai Kwun, Aaharn has a secret touch of Chinese culture, and you have to be mindful to notice it.0To begin with, we were served with a refreshing snack. Pineapple with caramelized seeds on top. The caramelized stuffing topped up the flavor of the pineapple by giving extra sweetness to it, and at the same time, making the pineapple more refreshing!Pomelo, Prawns, Toasted Coconut and Lime on Betel Leaves...0Pomelo, Prawns, Toasted Coconut and Lime on Betel Leaves...We chose this Pomelo, Prawns, Toasted Coconut and Lime on Betel Leaves as starter course. It was definitely wonderful! The prawns were meaty. The pomelo, toasted coconut and lime made a great salad with the seafood. Yet, beware of the green pepper, I chewed some seeds and they immediately made my tongue on fire!Crispy Perch with Tamarind and Chilli0Crispy Perch with Tamarind and ChilliMain course was this Crispy Perch with Tamarind and Chilli. It was kinda like Chinese style sweet and sour fish. The fish was fried before marinated with thesweet and sour sauce. It went really well with the coconut rice! What I like most was the fried herbal leaves (Perilla leaves)! Fish was fresh, but the sauce kinda masked its real taste.Longan Soup and Coconut Dumpling0Longan Soup and Coconut DumplingDessert was a delightful Longan Soup and Coconut Dumpling. The sweet, refreshing soup with ice made a great dessert with the fruit. And the coconut dumpling was absolutely fantastic! The coconut shreds wrapped around a mochi like dumpling with peanut stuffing. Definitely out of our expectation!I would recommend you to try out Aaharn to do it justice.",Aaharn,nan,220,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-aaharn/599601?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

Central,Thai,"It's always crowded during lunch hour in Central, too many people working in here, yet too little (affordable) place for lunch. I was so excited that Thai Chui has finally open a branch in Central. I used to go to their Sham Shui Po branch quite a lot, and I miss the food in there. To be honest, the store is quite far from my office, but it still worth the walk to catch some quick lunch.They occupied 2 floors in Central, so although it's crowded, but it's not as hard to get a seat. I usually get the Hainanese chicken rice lunch set. When I feel healthy, I would add $12 for a small dish of vegetables.Hainanese chicken rice0Hainanese chicken riceTo be honest, the space is quite packed and noisy.

Central,Thai,"I read about this Thai/Vietnamese restaurant at Soho on the Chope booking site, decided to give it a try for lunch with my best friend. It is quite a nice idea that it supports online booking via various booking site like OpenRice itself and the Chope booking site. Not only that I do not have to call the restaurant myself, but I could earn points for both site to redeem other awards.It was a sunny sweaty day in Hong Kong, it might not be the best idea to hike up to Soho for lunch. Luckily the air-conditioner of the restaurant is strong enough, together with the iced water being served, I managed to cool down quickly. As for the lunch menu, it is quite economical with a variety of different food. I picked the fried fish with egg noodles with salad as appetiser. A 2-course lunch cost less than $100, not a bad deal!Crispy Egg Noodle with Deep Fried Fish Fillet$ 880Crispy Egg Noodle with Deep Fried Fish Fillet$ 88The fried fish was above average, and the egg noodle was interesting, but the sauce was very weak. It doesn't really feels like Thai food, as Thai food are usually associated with heavier taste.All in all, it was a nice spot for lunch, but I guess I won't travel all the way to Soho just to try this restaurant. It's a good spot if you're nearby and wanted a decent place for group or solo lunch.",Soho Spice,3.5,97,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-soho-spice/12655?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
Central,Thai,"This was one of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had. My brother and I waited almost half an hour to even order - and once we did one thing we wanted wasnt available so we had to wait another 15 minutes to finish our order. Awful service, and the waiter showed absolutely no pleasure in serving us. Once our food came, it was inedible, we ordered a grilled ham and cheese and the bread was overly thick, the cheese was rubbery and fake (like American cheese), and developed a skin overtime - so it was most definitely processed and made with a lot of additives. The ham was rubbery as well. The fries that came with the dish were mediocre at best and were a huge let down from the picture. We also ordered spring rolls and they were the fresh ones instead of the fried we had wanted. We sent them back and were left Hungry. Very disappointing and will never return here. Overpriced and deplorable service.",Greyhound Caf,1.5,88,2,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-greyhound-cafe/67347?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
Central,Thai,"This time it was my friend who suggested coming to this place for lunch. I had given up rice noodles given the previously rather random quality and decided to try their  at a price of $78+10%.$ 860$ 86Surprisingly it was quite tasty. The rice was sticky rice mixed with some red rice. There were just 4 pieces of chicken and the chicken was not so tender and was a bit rough despite some of them being chicken thighs. There were quite a lot of vegetables which was really appreciated. Interestingly, there were loads of potato wedges but they were not freshly deep fried. Fortunately, they went well with the red curry sauce. The sauce was plentiful to finish the whole plate of food and was slightly spicy. It was quite tasty and special indeed with the hard-to-find-elsewhere sticky rice and delicious red curry sauce.

One of the staff showed her unwillingness to get a new glass for him when she was told about it. Took them so long to get one of our orders on our table. We ordered before the table beside us and they were served the same dish before us. Messy ordering system they had.Ordered the fresh prawn pad thai and it was tasteless yet the only spices it had was the spicy flakes. My friend ordered the pasta with shrimp, it was rather very spicy with no other taste at all and sauce was very watery.When we asked for the bill and gave our credit card, it took them 30 mins to realize that they didnt inform us their card machine was having problems which he could have told us earlier and we would have settled it by cash.Overall it was a horrible experience in everything.

As a complimentary item to the lunch set, there was really no complaint as it wasn't overly sweet and there was sufficient amount of coconut milk to make it smell so good.Overall, I would say that the quality of the food was quite good, especially given the relatively reasonable price in this district.

Central,Thai,Got here 1300 on a Saturday. Five tables of customers. One chef one waitress. The poor girl was totally overwhelmed. She had to run in and out of the kitchen for all the tasks. She spent 15min doing a big takeaway order. There was no one at the door to wait the table. There was no one to hand out the menu. There was no one to get the bill. A table of two girls- no one talked to them for 20min after they walked in. Food was actually good. I had a beef noodle and it was full of favor. Note to management- you cannot understaff a restaurant like that. Even a MCD gives better attention to customers.

Central,Thai,"Agree with other posters about the great sea view and the pleasant decor. Came for lunch but was rather disappointed, especially remembering LIAN which was run by the same group MAXIMS (MX) also at IFC.They only offered the set lunch menu and did not provide the a la carte menu until asked. Obviously only wanted people to order from the set menu so we did.First that came was the lime soda, nothing much to write about. It was fine.Then came the starters, not together for all diners at the table (only 2) but whatever/whichever was ready/handy for them/ I had the papaya and pork salad which was in fact fine except that within 2 minutes came my main course! The server, on seeing that I was about 10% into the starter, plonked the main course on the table and left. My companion's main course came 10 minutes later.My main course was beef pho. The pho was actually very good but the beef was only so-so. They also included some tripe which I did not like.It is fine to charge premium prices since HK is expensive and IFC especially so.

Each menu consists of a soup, main dish and dessert. However, no drinks are included in the set.The first main dish we ordered was home made flat noodles fried in a bean paste sauce. We were given the choice of chicken, pork, beef or prawns, which were to be served together. We picked chicken. Chicken was a bit skinny, but the noodle tasted delicious. The dish also contained vegetables.1We also ordered Classic Thai noodle dish with tofu, shrimps, bean sprouts and ground peanuts wrapped in an omelette, also known as Pad Thai.

The Saaur rong hai beef was a bit hot for me but I'm not a great lover of hot food and know many people who would love this. Finally the deserts are superb and you need to leave room for them, particularly the mango and blue sticky rice and coconut ice cream.Overall it was a great brunch experience, with great food and drink, but most of all the service is refreshingly .... not like customer service and more like hosting a group of friends.

Though quite high priced, the dishes looked all well made and the menu was difficult to chose from as there were many scrumptious options. I haven't had Thai food in a long time and my mother said her Pad Thai was very authentic and worth the 122 dollars she paid for it. I decided to order an appetizer which was amazingly portioned and very filling! I got a mixed vegetable spring roll made from rice vermicelli and not only was it plated beautifully but it had so much flavor. The sauces pairing with it added a nice spice as well.

Central,Thai,"We made a booking for 4 people, wanting to have a nice lunch at this rather new restaurant at Landmark. It turns out to be a very unpleasant experience.When we booked our table, we were informed that there are 2 timeslots, 12pm to 115pm and 1215pm to 130pm. We chose the 1215pm timeslot. Sat down at 1215, the waiter was already very aggressive trying to make us order. In the end, we only spent around 5mins to decide what to eat because we were forced to. We ordered Tom Yam Soup, Seafood Salad, Pad Thai, Fried Rice, Shirmp and crab cakes.All dishes arrived in reasonable time. However, we were harrassed since 1245pmand were asked to order desserts, while we were stillhaving the soup and otherdishes...At 1250pm, the same waiter came to us andasked us to order desserts because they need the table back by 115pm. We said our booking should be till 130pm and the manager came andinsisted that they need the table back by 115pm. Thank God they sentus SMS after booking, and we showed them the timeslot we booked. Already got quite fed up after this disturb. The manager then told us they can ""extend"" the table till 130pm.We then started seeing other tables checking their billsand started going. We thought we could finally have a nice lunch chatting and eating for the last half an hour. We were too optimistic....Here comes the waiter again asking us to order desserts because ""the kitchen is verybusy"". We did want to order some but after this kind ofdisturbs, we gave up and decided tojust finish the dishes.Even then, the waiter tried again and asked if we want any desserts or drinks. After failure, he came with the billat 115pm....we could not help but said ""it is only 115pm andcan youlet us have some peace?"" The waiter then went BUT came back againin 5 mins for the bill.When we were asked topay the bills, almost 50% of the tablesin this restaurant were empty and it was not like they really need our table that urgently.We were totally disappointed about this kind of services because the whole point we booked a restaurant to have lunch was to enjoy ourselves and chat. If wewanted a quick lunch, we might justgo to Canteen at Prince's Building. What is worse is that we were disturbed for more than 45 mins in our 1 hour and 15 mins lunch.Sorry Mak Mak, not that your food was not nice but yourservices wereway too bad for us to come back again.Supplementary InformationFood is nice but we never want to come back.",Mak Mak,nan,200,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-mak-mak/479537?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

I could fix my craving for BBQ as well as a proper meal to fill me up.The box comes with 3 skewers including chicken, beef and pork, they were all very good with lots of strong flavours, I liked the chicken the most as it was the most succulent one. Dont forget to dip those into the awesome BBQ sauce!Fried Rice with Thais BBQ ($60)$ 600Fried Rice with Thais BBQ ($60)$ 60I also liked the rice a lot. I assumed they fried the rice with some of the sauces they have in house. It was a bit spicy but it wont kill your palette. It was quite savoury therefore a side of veggie was also served. I would highly recommend this rice for you if you like salty food like me!The lemon tea was actually not bad also. It was pre-sweetened. I have asked if they could reduce the sweeteness but they said they could onlly add more ice to do so. So I just leave it as it is. It was actually not very sweet with lots of fresh lemon taste. It was just a lot better I expected.Jumbo Prawn ($70)Jumbo Prawn ($70)$ 700Jumbo Prawn ($70)$ 70My first impression was, wow, indeed thats jumbo! It was almost as long as my palm!

Hoisin sauce on baguette topped with roast duck. A twist from Peking duck pancake I guess. Bread was soggy by the time it arrived at table... Awful. Duck terrine ... Even worst. Duck pieces all fallen apart. It looked well marinated but it was dull and tasteless. Hugely disappointed. I had to ask the waiter why is it so tasteless. They didn't explain and offered to take it back. I then ordered a macaroni and cheese (from kids menu)to be safe. It was fine. All meals range around $150. A smoothie was $60. Without looking for the drinks menu I ordered apple juice x 2. These turned out to be the most expensive juice ever. $42 each!!! And they are not the fresh ones.Again I asked if there was a mistake..

Central,Thai,"General:  Found this place on Openrice, it is a bit hidden in a small side street but thanks to google maps still easy to find. The restaurant is very small and there were many people queueing up infront of the door. Inside looked very clean and nice but since it was small and lunchtime there were no vacant seats.Food:  We got different Lunch sets (chicken thai green curry, minced pork fried rice, grilled pork neck meat with rice and thai style Hainan Chicken with rice) each was around 50 HKD and came with a free soup and a free hot drink. For extra 12 HKD we got some steamed vegetables. The food was a very big portion and tasted very good. The thai green curry was a little spicy and had different vegetables and lots of chicken. The pork neck tasted very nice however since there was no sauce with the rice the rice tasted a bit dry and bland. The free soup was very yummy and made with wintermelon. Other lunch sets are with noodle soups and even cheaper.Overall:  The price, the amount of food, the taste and the fact that this is in central make this restaurant my new favourite choice! Very good taste, big portion size... the only thing that could need some improvement is the waiting time of around 15 minutes in the heat in the small (but busy) sidestreet.

I can taste the syrup so I assume it's not the fresh kind of coconut juice but it's still good.The big plate of pad thai came shortly after (when I only get to drink a few sip of the soup). The waitress also gave me a condiments tray for my pad thai which I think is nice service! There they have sugar/salt, dried chili, the salty fish sauce, and some type of vinegar which I tried to mix with the pad thai (except for the sugar/salt) and I found the vinegar the best condiment to go with to my surprise! The pad thai has an artificial orange color to it, a bit more ketchup / tomato paste than other restaurants, but the flavours go well together. What I also like is the peanut crunches on the side so I can add to my noodles according to my own personal preference.I finished my meal within 20 mins and am surprised to find empty seats at around 1pm!

I was expecting the fish to be slightly chewy, but it was completely crispy and I wasn't the biggest fan. I personally thought the rice overall was too plain, and it didn't have enough spices. My go to appetizer is always the Homemade Pate with Cognac and Fresh Green Peppercorns (Served with crispy toasts). It's basically Foie Gras spread and it's delicious. The pate is smooth and I love the unique taste paired with the peppercorns. It tasted like capers. If you go to Greyhound, you have to try their Iced Lemon Tea (Greyhound Style).

My colleague and I ordered a Fried Rice and another colleague ordered a Pad Thai. At this point, my impression of the waiter was not good.

We asked the waiter to chase our food since we were in a hurry - which he replied okay. 15 minutes later - still no sign of food and we saw another table being served fried rice. As this point, we were ready to get up and leave, when we saw the waitress bring out 2 Pad Thai's but did not approach our table first. She said one Pad Thai to one table and then approached our table. After serving the Pad Thai to my colleague, we asked about the other 2 fried rice main dishes and why was our food taking so long. Her reply was ""We are waiting for other tables so that we can cook them altogether."" What kind of response is this! SO if another table was to order fried rice, does this mean we have to wait again? The server was not apologetic at all. After complaining, we still had to wait another 15 minutes.

The prawn cake was spongy and fairly seasoned and fresh! 5/1005/10Stir-fried noodles in Thai style (3/10)A very standard stir-fried noodle, however, if instant noodle was not used as the base of the dish would be much more preferable. The noodle was greatly seasoned with soy sauce, fish sauce and it was slightly sweet.3/1003/10Green Chicken Curry (0/10)This could have been one of the best dish of the lunch. This moreish, sweet but spicy, fragranced, green-tinged sauce can play host to a variety of meat or vegetables. The green curry paste was full of flavour, lemongrass stalks, kaffir lime leaves, ground coriander, cumin seeds and galangal was all there. The flavour was just perfect. However, the chef made the greatest mistake but using salt as sugar, the dish was totally destroyed. 0/1000/10I hope I have better luck next time with my curry.  The school boy error from the chef is not going to stop me to revisit, because from my experience so far, they have been very consistent with their food. It was just an one off incident.

Central,Thai,"Cicada is one westernised Thai restaurant located in the heart of soho. It has elegant dcor with semi-opened dining room. I really wanted to try it out because every time I walked pass, it was a full house no matter dinner/lunch.  Cuisine: Fusion-AsianFood rating: 3/10*Service: 4/10 Ambiance: 4/10Price: HK$100 pax* Food Rating: 6/10 is equivalent to 1 Michelin star, 8/10 to two Michelin stars, and 9/10 or above to three Michelin starsKoftas (3/10)Koftas are served with a lightly spiced sauce, which is delicious soaked up with warm flat bread. Clearly not the case at Cicada, the sauce was yogurt base, not spicy at all. The koftas was nicely mixed together, after all, perfect for westerners, not Asian.  303Samosas (3/10)Vegetarian samosas tend to be the most popular for light snacking. The samosas were filled with a selection of vegetables and spices. The Samasas were freshly cooked, served warm that was not expected. This is because a lot of the restaurants in Soho serve cold samosas. 303Soy Sauce Pork Rice (3/10)In general it was just ordinary rice; the pork was tender and marinated well. Nothing special or bad about the dish.3/1003/10Chicken with cashew Rice (3/10)Same as the pork rice.3/1003/10This place is a lovely place to gather with friends if you dont mind the westernised food. The food is actually do taste good, just not authentic.

Central,Thai,"Fantastic set lunch. Mixed chicken dumpling soup with rice vermicelli and seaweed was excellent. Vegetable deep fried prawn spring roll was to die for.

Central,Thai,"Extremely rude and bad service!! During reservation, they already told me that we would need to give back the table at 13h15 for a 12h booking - as they split lunch time into 2 main periods. The waitress who picked up the phone was so rude and arrogant!!When we arrived, we wanted to ask them a question regarding to the menu, they nodded to our waving but then never came back! The dishes are so small and aren't really worth the price! Also the taste wasn't special either. They way they presented the ice tea (for my friend) was nice, but my banana shake had no banana favour! Once we finished our dishes, they dropped the bill on our table. We paid, without finishing the drink, the waiter (seemed to be the manager) came and spoke to us loudly that ""do you want something else, do to want something else...""... I looked at the watch, it was only 12h50!! Not even 13h!!   I am so angry so decided to make my very first comment on openrice!! WILL NEVER GO BACK!!!",Greyhound Caf,nan,170,2,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-greyhound-cafe/67347?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
Central,Thai,"Had been craving for SEA food, so came over to this restaurant for lunch. It was full and there was quite a number of people waiting in front of us when we reached there. Waiting time for table is about 10-15minutes.We've ordered 1 nasi lemak with chicken rendang, 1 fried vermicelli with chicken rendang, soft-boiled eggs, and drinks (iced coffee and milo dinasaur).The nasi lemak was good, chicken rendang was very nice, better than Toast Box which its standard had dropped lately. The fried vermicelli with chicken rendang was good too. However, the soft-boiled eggs was a little over-cooked - the york had harden. Overall, the food was good, would say better than Toast Box (their food standard had been dropping and service was bad). Their service was not too bad, even though some of their staffs tend to be clumpsy and slow.Nasi Lemak with Chicken Rendang0Nasi Lemak with Chicken RendangFried Vermicelli with Chicken Rendang0Fried Vermicelli with Chicken RendangSoft-boiled Eggs - slightly over-cooked0Soft-boiled Eggs - slightly over-cooked",Asian Twist,3.5,90,10,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-asian-twist/48887?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw
Central,Thai,"This restaurant is better in theory than in reality.  The menu looks interesting, but fails to deliver.  As an example, The Spicy Muay Thai Burger was a thoroughly ordinary burger with lots of gristle and little character; only the dipping sauce on the side had any flavor and saved this dish from total disappointment.  The portions were very small, requiring a supplemental, post-lunch top up across the way at simplylife.Service was also lacking, with the burger coming out raw (ordered medium).  It was quickly overcooked to a dull Grey without any acknowledgement of the error.I will not return to this restaurant.",Greyhound Caf,2.3,150,15,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-greyhound-cafe/67347?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
Central,Thai,"Overpriced (due to poor quality of food and services)1. Tom Yum Soup-- with only a few pieces of half mushroom and one shrimp.  Though the shrimp was rather big-size, it's not fresh and its texture felt like mash potato when we chewed it.  The soup had only the taste of sourness, pretty shallow and unfulfilling.2. Pad Thai -- Taste good.  A bit soggy.  There were 4 shrimps and they were fresh and crunchy.  The portion was too small.  There's only approx. one rice-bowl-size amount of noodles.  Definitely can't feed a regular adult-size person.   Cant' understand why they give so little noodles as noodles are very cheap...  You have to count on ordering one more item if you want to feel fulfilling.3. Fried Chicken Wings (supposed to be the signature dish)-- looked, tasted, and felt (texture) like overnight leftovers and were reheated in the oven.  Pretty dry and hard.4. Thai Ice Tea-- okay.  Like any other Ice Tea from any Thai restaurant.Ambience was nice.Service was poor.  Servers (3 to 4 of them) kept forgeting/ ignoring what we requested (bowl, water...) that the only one who would remember and follow up is the manager.",Greyhound Caf,2.3,175,3,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-greyhound-cafe/67347?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw
Central,Thai,"Iced Lemon Tea0Iced Lemon TeaToasted with Ham and Cheese0Toasted with Ham and CheeseFried Chicken Wings0Fried Chicken WingsTried this restaurant with high expectation but I guess I am not a huge fan of fusion Thai food, so was a bit disappointed.  Chicken wings have only salty taste but no herb taste at all.  Thai lemon tea is the best of all, chocolate mousse has no surprise.  If people don't like too spicy version of Thai food, this will be ideal to suit your taste.  As to Tom Yum Soup, the menu already mentioned that it's a mild version, so as expected there's no strong taste found in the soup.  Worth to try though....",Greyhound Caf,3.2,250,5,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-greyhound-cafe/67347?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw
Central,Thai,"The service was so bad it was embarrassing! I went for the lunch deal - which was reasonably priced at under $80 for a starter and a main. For starters I had the green papaya salad, which was just about alright. It was quite tasty, but went it overboard on the fish sauce, and was swamped in the dressing so it was too wet. It was also COVERED in peanuts which didn't do it any favours. The main I had was pad thai noodles which we just TERRIBLE. Too gloopy and tasted of ketchup. Plus it was supposed to have tofu in it, but these were deep fried beyond oblivion, so I didn't dare try it. Worst though was the service. From what I saw the waiting staff didn't get a single table right. Starters arrived at different times, or in some cases after the main course, and drink orders were forgotten until the end of the meal! At my table, my friend had completely finished their main course before mine even arrived. SHOCKING. Good job they don't charge service charge because there is no way I would pay it anyway.Only redeeming feature was the setting, the restaurant is well decorated and pleasant, but unfortunately for them it won't be enough to make me ever go back!",Koh Thai,2.3,80,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-koh-thai/42922?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
