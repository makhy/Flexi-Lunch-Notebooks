Central,Chinese,"Ive always been a huge fan of Shanghai food, especially their pan-fried bun and XiaoLongBao. After returning from Shanghai few months ago, Ive been searching for the best place for pan-fried buns for a while. Little did I know that theres a michelin star Cheung Hing Kee located just 20 mins from where I live and I swear to God, they really do have THE BEST pan-fried buns in town. Each and every single one of them came out hot and juicy. I had to be extremely careful to not burn my tongue with the broth inside the bun. The bottom of the buns were also crispy. The only thing I didnt like was that therere no seating so you gotta stand the whole time, but other than that, everything was Perfect. 100/100 would recommend and re-visit someday. 00",Cheung Hing Kee Shanghai Pan-fried Buns,4.8,50,nan,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-cheung-hing-kee-shanghai-pan-fried-buns/554383?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

Central,Chinese,"Went out to have lunch with colleagues on a Happy Friday. Picked this restaurant as my colleagues wished to have Taiwanese food.0I chose this , as I missed the time I had unagi in Tokyo. To begin with, the whole piece of eel is grilled to an optimal juiciness and scent. You can smell a bit of charred taste, but the meat of the fish is still tender and moist. The sesame, seaweed on top also add some umami and crunchiness to the eel as well. The soft-boiled egg was a nice touch too, which adds some molten yolk to the rice. However, the rice is rather on the soft and mushy side0Sorry to say but the soup was mediocre, didn't expect much from it, but I suggest them to add more flavour to the soup. Will come back for the rice though.",,3.5,140,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-%E4%B8%80%E8%B5%B7%E9%A3%9F%E5%A0%82/603439?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

Central,Chinese,"For a period of time, this restaurant survived me the toughest of times, it provided me quick and yet a very decent lunch experience daily.  Its tucked in the end of a secret food street, Chiu Lung Street, in the hub of Central district.  No super long queues because it is not cheap in price for the portion in comparison to what other restaurants offered along that street.  0Ox tongue soup rice noodle was never disappointing, I loved how it was thickly cut and texture was always super soft and moist.  Together with the  spicy sour preserved vegetables topping (+HK$6), it got me addicted.  The soup base is always a very clear and delicate beef broth which has so much flavour, this alone, in my opinion is worth the money.0Recently I tried this drunken chicken wings, I was lucky because by 1:40pm, this was the last order left.  I loved how it tasted very home made, because this small old restaurant did not make huge batches.  The drunken sauce was done just right - sweetness, tanginess of alcohol was very gentle yet enough to make it thoroughly absorbed.  Texture of meat was bouncy, and so was the skin. Size of the wings were also excellent!I can recommend more and more.... beef tendon soup rice noodles (), beef brisket soup rice noodles ()...deep fried fish balls () and ginger scallion noodles ()...",Yummy Noodle,4.8,100,5,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-yummy-noodle/112444?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
Central,Chinese,"I hadn't come for a long long time because it had been so hard to make a reservation for lunch hours on weekdays. I made a call about 2 weeks ago and surprisingly I managed to secure a table for 5.I was brought to the far end of the long corridor to occupy the seemingly best round table at the corner. With the pretty antique fans rotating on the high ceilings overlooking the little garden of the cityhall, it was quite a cozy environment for lunch indeed.00The menu had changed and it seemed that prices had generally inflated a little bit. Luckily the famous good old items were still there. I ordered my all-time favourite Linguine with Prawn in Tomato Sauce.Bread & Butter0Bread & ButterBread was served very soon, with 1 pack of butter for each of us. The bread was just slightly warm. It was the good old buttery flavour in a pretty soft texture. The butter was melting but it was ok to eat with the bread.Garden Salad with French Dressing0Garden Salad with French DressingA lunch set included an appetiser of Russian Borscht or Cream of Mushroom Soup or Garden Salad with French Dressing. I picked the salad, which was quite a big bowl when served with appropriate amount of dressing. The veggies seemed to be quite fresh.Linguine with Prawn in Tomato Sauce$ 1320Linguine with Prawn in Tomato Sauce$ 132Linguine with Prawn in Tomato Sauce used to be my all-time favourite, which I ordered almost every time during my visit. However, it had really disappointed me. The portion was HUGE as you can tell from the photo. There was plenty of sauce to finish off everything from the plate. However, the linguine itself was quite a ruin as it was too soft, not al dente at all. There were 5 big prawns which were meaty and fresh although they could have been better. The tomato sauce was ok but not as good as those before which was slightly orange in colour and tasted a little bit sour to make the whole thing so appetising.A drink was included in the set. I ordered hot lemon water with 3 thick slices of lemon. There was nothing special. I wish I could have chosen milk tea but I gave it up given my poor sleep quality recently.All the dishes my friends ordered seemed to be so huge in terms of portion and all of them almost finished everything so I could tell the quality of the food was not bad. Service was a bit slow, maybe because of our location.

Central,Chinese,"FoodFor a restaurant with a Michelin star sibling, it has a long way to go. The menu selection is limited, which I understand given the restaurant size.  The only positive feedback is that the dimsum came hot (as it should). The thickness of their dumpling wraps / flour rolls could be more delicate, need to work on their condiment selection (hot sauce, xo sauce), and the shrimp in the flour roll only had crunch but lacked flavor (i.e. missing garnishes). The ""goon tong gow"" was clear and flavorful, but nothing tastes good if the service is foul.  ServiceThe service was beyond appalling, their staff unprofessional. Not only did they check their mobile phone during service, some staff had very poor attitudes towards their patrons, and if they don't like you they have no hesitation to let you know this. All in all, a very unforgettable experience and one that I would not wish on anyone.

Both flavors are well rounded and leave nothing lacking. The curry beef brisket has a nice kick of spice. The regular beef brisket has a nice rich flavor to it that makes it irresistible.

The sea eel was quite big given the price. I would say it was quite a good value for money given that sea eel is so expensive nowadays. It was not really hot when served but still ok - i.e. the normal flavour of sea eel you would expect. The stir-fried udon itself was pretty good too - which was done quite well and al dente!

Central,Chinese,"Quick squiz:New on the block, still a hidden gem. A friend noticed its new opening and we decided to visit for a weekday lunch. Food was top notch and its obvious they've made an effort. Same goes for service. It's also apparent that they have considered their decor to match their overall theme, exuding a classic elegance exceeding the quality you might have expected in a modern interpretation popping up in this lane.More about the Restaurant:1Restaurant wasn't particularly full when we arrived shortly before 1pm. But then again, it's still very new to the extent that the flower placards are still at the entrance and it does not even have an Openrice page as of this writing.Onto the food... we were a table of 2, ordered 5 dishes and were extremely satisfyingly full afterwards. All were carefully put together. While all of the dimsum were good, the highlight was the sliced goose.0Pan-fried conpoy turnip cake ($33)This was pan-fried nicely - a slight crisp to the surface with good turnip content but not too overwhelming. One of the better turnip cakes you'd have and a warming reminder of the new year delicacy. Recommended.0Steamed vegetarian ""eight treasures"" dumplings ($33)A dimsum classic. Supple dumpling skin wraps around an exciting mix of vegetable texture inside make this a welcoming dish. Recommended.0Steamed egg white and crab meat dumplings ($42)This was a recommended dish in their menu and thought we'd give it a try. the overall texture was soft and supple - perhaps a little too much that it was sometimes hard to tell the difference between the dumpling skin and the contents. Taste was good. Can be improved by having the crab meat appear as strands so that it can be distinguished while in the mouth. Consider it.0Rice flour rolls filled with crispy seafood roll ($59)Maxims (and I'm sure other places) offer something similar. The portion to this is smaller than Maxims. It's more intricately made. The crispy batter layered between the rice flour and the seafood roll is finer (thinner) than Maxims, as is the rice flour, making this dish feel like a more intricate and hand-crafted version of Maxims iteration. Recommended.0Sliced goose ($199)Very generous portions, well laid out The meat was warm, moist and tender with a hint of cinnamon powder sprinkled on top. I have not had a sliced goose dish so caringly prepared in a very long while. The tofu underneath was smooth and rich on flavour, albeit a little soft. Highly recommended.0Tea ($18 per person)This felt a little steep but it's a staple and hard to be missed. Aroma of the barley teabag was good and lasted throughout the whole meal.Restaurant was playing some popular classic Cantonese tunes in the background, completing the experience. Unfortunately the music appeared to be an afterthought as it was playing through what appeared to be a set of Bluetooth speakers placed in a corner. There was also quite a bit of background noise making it not the most quiet of places, a little unsettling, but far from being of any concern when it comes to conversation.Service was polite, attentive and well thought through. For example, they poured the soy sauce on both sides of the plate of the crispy rice flour roll, rather than directly on top. They cleared the table promptly of finished dishes and added water to the pot efficiently. It was a nice touch to remind us to have the food while hot when they serve each dish.My only real gripe to service is the lack of any napkins (wet or dry) as is typically the case in Hong Kong, which I was told were being sold for $5 a pack. I declined as I've always found it absurd for restaurants not to provide napkins. This would be fine in a 'char chan teng' environment, but I would certainly expect more at this price point. To their credit, they did bring over a box of tissues and allowed us to take a couple from it.All in all, it's obvious they've placed a lot of thought into it - from the decor, music and service to the food. I'd be eager to come back to try out more of their other options. In honesty, it's not easy to find something like this in modern Hong Kong. Hopefully they'll have free napkins soon...010",NOVE Chinese Kitchen,4.6,220,nan,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-nove-chinese-kitchen/636629?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

The staff were cheerful but I must say they are not very efficient. There was no one before me and I still had to wait for 10min to get my food.

Great fresh shrimp ingredients indeed, although the noodles themselves were definitely far from good because they were not al dente at all. However, the creativity together with nice presentation really made it a very good dish. It reminded me of eating wonton noodles. Overall, I would rate it 4.5 because the noodles could have been cooked better.Overall, it was quite a good experience to try special dim sum and quality was definitely better than many places. However, really had to admit that it was so pricey as we just had 5 dim sum and the cost was over $250 per head. That said, good to come once in a long while.By the way, service was ok.

Central,Chinese,"I've actually been to 'Fang Fang' before for dinner and although it seems like an over-glorified Chinese restaurant, it was actually quite good. At the time I remember the service was excellent where staff were attentive and could offer insights and recommendations as to which dishes we would like but without it feeling like an aggressive or pushy sale. The food itself was fresh and full of flavour as well as being beautifully presented, so I did have good thoughts about this place; until my experience today.My boss booked a table of 8 for the desk due to hearing so many rave reviews and we were all quite eager to try it out for lunch. We were guided to the private room, which was a pleasant surprise and the member of staff was very courteous. We found out that they had a lunch set menu only and no  la carte, which was a little disappointing but acceptable as I guess we couldn't expect every item to be offered if it was to be cooked fresh and with so many diners that needing serving. For a modest $198 HKD we were in a clean, suavely decorated establishment, right in the heart of Central. We certainly didn't have any qualms about that!From the set menu I ordered:*Starters*-Dim sum (1 x Signature shrimp dumpling & 1 x Truffle mushroom dumpling)-Hot and Sour Soup*Main*-Sweet & sour Iberico pork with pomelo and strawberry*Dessert*-Fried custard dumplingThere weren't too many issues with the starters to be fair. I am not a fan of mushrooms, so I have no idea what possessed me to order the hot and sour soup, but I did and I found it too be a quite soothing. The mushrooms had a slight crunch with a subtle flavour that complemented the acidity and spice of the soup. The soup itself was thick and smooth and felt satisfying and hearty with each and every mouthful.Hot and sour soup0Hot and sour soupThe dim sum was so-so as the filling was prepared very well and enriched with all the fresh ingredients cooked just right, but the outer casings were sticky and fell apart quite easily, which made the combination rather laboured when taking a bite. The dumplings were also extremely hot when they were served, so it appears as though they were a little too eager to get the dishes out to the customers rather than let them cool down for just a little while to overcome the issues.Dim Sum0Dim SumThe main was a disappointment for me, not that I couldn't eat it, but just the concept behind it. I figured that as you had to pay extra and since Iberico pork is regarded as quite the delicacy, I would be served thick, succulent slices of pork lightly glazed with an invigorating sweet sauce. However, I received sweet and sour pork, as common as you would find anywhere else in HK. It tasted fine if you accepted it as that quintessential takeaway favourite, but why waste the meat by battering it and masking the flavour? Would you consider using A5 Kobe beef for a spaghetti bolognese as well?With regards to the mains, we were served our rice first and then the main dishes came at different times ranging from 20-40 minutes later. This was poor planning and service as we either had to wait for everyone to be served and then our food would go cold or eat straight away and finish at different times, while the last few to start feel pressure to wolf down their main without taking a moment to enjoy their meal. Some of my colleagues ordered the fish (which came in 3 meagre pieces) and even then they barely touched it as they didn't expect something 'grilled' to be battered.Sweet and sour Iberico pork0Sweet and sour Iberico porkI thought that they might redeem themselves with the dessert, the 'fried custard dumpling', but it was hardly the case. What I received was a single 'jin dui' (fried glutinous rice ball) with ice cream. It was hard to break into and got tightly wedged on my spoon as I was trying to take a piece. I expected custard to drip out but it seemed like there was just lotus paste lining the inside.0The member of staff was courteous enough to try and make amends by offering us all coffee on the house, which was a nice gesture, but couldn't really make up for the experience itself.I am not actually greatly critical of many places and can enjoy very simple meals, but this was a really disappointing experience for me and I have said all the above with pure sincerity and no malicious intent whatsoever.FINAL VERDICT:A GREAT PLACE MARRED BY A PURELY UNINSPIRING LUNCHLunch set0Lunch set",Fang Fang,nan,220,nan,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-fang-fang/531351?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

It was highly recommended.Curry Beef Brisket with potatoes & bell peppers0Curry Beef Brisket with potatoes & bell peppersThe curry beef brisket was good as well with tender beef briskets and delicious curry sauce. Even the potatoes were so delicious with crispy crust and soft interior. There were quite a lot of bell peppers and onions accompanying the beef briskets. To pick bones from an egg, there could have been more beef briskets and the curry sauce could have been thicker.Lotus Leaf Mushroom Rice0Lotus Leaf Mushroom RiceWe all chose this over the Jasmine rice. Last time, I recalled there was insufficient flavour or smell of lotus leaf and the rice was just like plain rice. But this time it seemed better with richer flavour of the lotus leaf. But again I found it a bit too plain still.Sweetened Almond Cream0Sweetened Almond CreamI chose sweetened almond cream as my dessert. It was a bit too diluted but still it was smooth and not overly sweet.Fried Carrot Custard Dumpling0Fried Carrot Custard DumplingI didn't the fried carrot custard dumpling but it looked so cute that I couldn't help but take a picture! My lunch partner said that the fried carrot was actually something with black sesame stuffing and a crispy crust while there was a vanilla ice-cream served on the side. I would definitely have ordered this if I had known that it was made of these ingredients!Overall, I think the quality of the food had improved even more, making it a even better deal given the price and location in Central. Just that service was a bit slow today maybe because they were really too busy.

Central,Chinese,"Once you walk into this place, you will be quite amazed at how beautifully decorated it is. Elegant, ambient lighting guides the way as you tentatively descend the spiral staircase towards the dining area. As you walk to your table you can watch the cooks working hard to prepare your dishes and see all the BBQ meat (like the roast goose) on display; an homage to the traditional roots of the food.In short, Mott 32 serves a modern fusion of the traditional dim sum, immaculately presented, but at a hefty markup. It's true that compared to the local places, the dishes appear more carefully prepared with higher-end ingredients, however, the price seems to reflect the cost of the surroundings more than the cost of the food itself. From the dishes I've tried, they were very good indeed; oozing flavour, well-balanced and you could taste the relatively superior quality of the fillings.I would recommend this place as somewhere to take a client or if you want to make a good impression on someone that's visiting Hong Kong , but for a general experience of the local cuisine, just go out there and explore.FINAL VERDICT:A LUXURIOUS TASTE OF HONG KONG'S MOST BELOVED TEA TIME TRADITION",Mott 32,4.1,500,10,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-mott-32/166406?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

The Wagyu was stewed very well so that it was really tender. The sauce was quite tasty and not oily at all. It was quite a good dish, except that my piece of short rib was too fatty! The trio of onions reminded me of Shanghainese-style of fried beef with onions.Steamed Garoupa Fillet, Sichuan Chili0Steamed Garoupa Fillet, Sichuan ChiliAgain this dish was served together with the beef so we had to eat this dish first before the fish turned cold. This dish was very good. They were served really hot. The garoupa fillets were really fresh. I liked how there were Sichuan Chili to enhance the flavour. The transparent noodles underneath were quite delicious eating with the Sichuan Chili too.While they had served all the mains together at a time, it took us a long long while to be served the udon, maybe because they had been waiting for another table next door to finish their mains to cook ours altogether. They didn't let us order 1 fried rice and 1 udon to share, which I actually didn't see much inconvenience for them to do so because they were offering two choices only anyway.Soup Inaniwa Udon, Bean Curd Sheet, Fish Broth0Soup Inaniwa Udon, Bean Curd Sheet, Fish BrothSoup Inaniwa Udon, Bean Curd Sheet, Fish BrothAnyway, the fish broth was really rich in fish with quite some pepper. The bean curd sheets were fresh and plentiful. The udon was smooth. I preferred this one to fried rice because this one was obviously more healthy and less oily.0It was dessert of the day and we didn't have a choice. I was never a fan of but it was ok. The sweet soup was rich in ginger and was of the right degree of sweetness. The sweet potato was ok, although the one for my lunch partner didn't seem so. Great for such a cold day. It made me so warm after drinking.Overall, most of the food was good despite some failed dishes. But given the price of the food at a per-head cost of $800 for such a meal, it was definitely too expensive. It was very obvious that they would like to offer good service with servers in general being polite and attentive helping you to refill your water/tea from time to time. There were a lot of room for improvement in the order of serving and decoration of the plates, especially if they are targeting at achieving Michelin stars or charging Michelin prices for their food. At such a price, there are a lot more better choices in the same district.",Ding's Club,3.3,800,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-dings-club/589400?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw
Central,Chinese,It was my second visit. This time I decided to try something different. Ordered their basic lunch set without any top-up at a cost of $80 (price has inflated) including 1 bowl of noodles + 1 dessert + 1 drink.0The portion seemed big. The total amount of pork soft bones was around the size of your palm and the quality was reasonably good. The rice noodles were smooth. I did feel full after finishing the whole bowl. Didn't feel particularly thirsty afterwards.0The degree of sweetness seemed to be about right. There were quite a lot of  and . It seemed to be quite a healthy option of dessert for winter time.I ordered the hot  as the drink. It was quite thick and was sweeter than the sweet soup but still I didn't find it overly sweet.Got a -$6 coupon so the meal altogether cost me $74. My stomach was full until around evening time. Quite a healthy and filling option for lunch although it was relatively pricey.,Chee Kei,3.7,74,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-chee-kei/95900?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

You get two choices, which you can point to outside or take a look and tell the waitress the numbers for if you don't speak Cantonese. Then the rice, the noodles and soup are all serve-yourself. For only 28 (just white rice, no soup) to 35 dollars (help-yourself rice, fried noodles, and soup), it is incredible value for the food which is tasty and leaves you very full.Sometimes it can be a little busy and the staff seem a little hectic, but the people who work there are all kind. They always say hello and smile at me even though I don't speak the language.I recommend not going directly at lunch time (12:30-1:30 seems to be the most busy), but other times are fine.

Central,Chinese,"When you first enter this restaurant, it is clear thatit wants to be in the companyof Central's high end Chinese food competition (Mott 32, Duddells, China Tang, even the China Club.). Unfortunately, The Chinese Library falls short of its mark.The room looks very classy. As one would expect from an Aqua Group restaurant,it is a visual stunner. However, the food (I had the Deluxe Set Menu lunch), the service, and the valuefor moneyare just ""ok"".First, the service. While my experience was not as bad as it was for some of the other folks who have posted reviews, it wasn't great either. My biggest gripe is that the servicewas extremely uneven, ranging from obsequious to non-existent in the course of a 90 minute lunch. Upon arrival, there was a flurry of activity but as my lunch wore on, the service became less and less. The staff seemed very inexperienced and the service was, generally, hesitant. At one point, a diner at the table next to me spilled a glass of wine onto the floor. Immediately, 5 wait staff sprang to action to clean it up. No problem with that - but unfortunately, for the next 10 minutes, there were no wait people doing anything else but trying to clean up the spilled wine. Trying to get anyone's attention to ask for thebill was futile. The only bright spot in the service was Nina. I asked her if she was the head waitress, because she was the only one who moved with confidence, was just the right amount of attentive, knew what she was doing, etc. She told me she was the most junior person. In this case, Aqua Group - please give Nina a promotion - she needs to train the other staff in your restaurant.The foodwas fine. A bit bland overall - nothing to get excited about. For the set lunch, the only standouts werethe groupa and the tofu panne cotta. Everything else was underseasoned or unwhelming. Like the service, the food was not horrible, but it wasn't excellent either. The portion size was ok. Again, everything was just ""ok"".My bill for three people including tea and service was $1,208. This is also ok. Not overly expensive for what I got, but not a bargain either.Basically, the Chinese Library is an average restaurant in a beautiful venue. For the moment, it will fillit's tables with tourists and visitors to Tai Kwun. However, it is unlikely to get a lot of repeat business given that it's location is slightly out of the way for business folks from Central and it faces a lot of competition from the hundreds of other restaurants around SOHO once the novelty of Tai Kwun wears off. For a restaurant like this to thrive, it needs to be spectacular.

Central,Chinese,"If you live in HK, or a visitor looking to get a glimpse of how locals live, these are hole in the wall places you should check out. Decor is simple, or lack of. Just tables and plastic stools with little to no service. That is essentially the definition of a local casual HK cafe. While many office workers ordered their breakfast combo, my table ordered from the lunch menu. I had the curry beef brisket with rice which was very solid. Quite a large portion and the subtle heat was nice. HOWEVER, my colleagues ordered the steamed minced meat with salted egg and a baked Bolognese sauce with rice which were extremely bland. Enough for them to never come back. So its essentially a hit or a miss.

My colleagues neither as all the items look terrible, weren't worth taking photos. Not a single item caught my attention. My appetite was destroyed.When I wanted to pay with Mileslife, the cashier told me no as I booked through OpenRice.

But how come I can't choose which promotion to enjoy? After arguing with the cashier for quite some time. She finally agreed to let me use Mileslife to pay and emphasized how much commission the restaurant is going to pay for both OpenRice and Mileslife.Supplementary InformationThe most irritating thing is that when I got back to the office, I received an email informing that I was absent for the booking.

Central,Chinese,"As most of you know, everyday is Mother's Day, so I decided to treat my mom to Yum Cha for a different Chinese cuisine experience. This is our first time to this restaurant but we've always wanted to try it out. We were able to be seated earlier than my original booking at 11:45. We were warmly welcomed firstly by Ms Kalpana who was kind enough to answer all my questions relating to Asia Miles. She was very nice, patient and knowledgeable.Then we met another friendly face, Ms Bing. She was happy to serve our table throughout our time there. She was also informative as she shared a bit of background information of the restaurant as well as some tips on our choices. We could tell that she was proud and happy to be part of the team.The food did not disappoint us at all. It looked and tasted delicious. You could opt for the lunch set or even just the dessert set. However, since it wasn't our first 'yum cha' experience in Hong Kong and we're not tourists either, we made up our own set of dishes from the main menus, including another set involving 2 appetizers and 1 main dish for $119. Best to read through the whole menu because we almost missed that option!The atmosphere was bright and relaxing overall. Although we weren't pleased that despite the restaurant being fairly 'empty' at the time, the next pair of customers just happened to be our neighbours. They were quite noisy, which ruined the mood a bit. Nonetheless, the food was great. The dishes came out hot and were delivered at a good pace. If you're particular about which dishes you'd like to eat first, you probably have to inform the staff as the first 2 dish that we had were the florette buns with a hint of red bean (condensed milk for dipping) and the custard-filled buns (the one and only, as marketed everywhere in Hong Kong). Though we did not mind, however when we do come for the next round, we'd prefer to have the dishes in order (hot apps > main > dessert).Overall, we had a great lunch and we enjoyed taking photos right after. Many thanks to the Yum Cha staff in Central for giving us, especially my mom, another happy and brand new version of a yumcha experience.

Central,Chinese,"Quick Squiz:Visited for a weekday lunch on recommendation of a friend who visited earlier. Impressive entrance and front desk service, welcoming bar staff as we walked past, exciting (and delicious) menu. Staff were still ""running-in"" with some unfamiliarity with menu and service protocol, but perhaps holding it back the most would be its price.More about the restaurant:Set in the newly opened Tai Kwun in Central, its address on the first floor of the former Police Headquarters instantly gives the place a special aura (I take issue with the official address on their name card reading ""Police Headquarters"". Either Tai Kwun needs to change the official name or Chinese Library needs to change theirs). Signage to the restaurant was lacking probably because it's still so new (it is not listed under restaurants at the Tai Kwun physical directory). Staff at the entrance (door, if you may, as it was an impressively imposing one) greeted us with confidence and offered to keep our umbrellas. Walking through the bar area to the restaurant involved being greeted with multiple friendly smiles and welcomes. Very inviting.The dining hall had an aura on entering, with furniture colour not unlike my cup of cappuccino. Perhaps the table right at the entrance was a little too close and open to everyone walking past though (still remember the two ladies looking up at us - and perhaps every other table of guests - entering the restaurant). Anyway, I digress.As a party of four, we were seated at one of their half-moon bench tables. Cushions rightfully plush with appropriate depth and height. Tableware design is welcomingly minimalistic with two sets of chopsticks per person. Table was a little small to fit a lot on it, but their staff kept tabs of our progress so the food wouldn't pile on at once. Admirably done.0On to the food - we were provided with multiple versions of menus (too many - really) - a standard a la carte menu, a dim sum menu and a lunch menu (which includes a selection of a la carte and dim sum menu items). We ordered from the a la carte menu and dim sum menu as they provided better choice. If I recall correctly, there were two lunch sets available, with one being at around HK$380 (same price as our a la carte). The lunch menu was otherwise too basic to provide real selection or to really appreciate their offerings.We ordered the following (unfortunately forgot to take a few photos):Chrysanthemum ""thousand cut"" silken tofu in chicken broth ($108 pp)Garoupa fillet with spring onion and ginger Cheung Fun Rice Rolls ($118)Taro puff with aubergine and salted fish ($58)Hokkaido king crab & sea urchin spring rolls ($118)PoachedChinese loofah & matsutake mushrooms ($148)Sweet & sour Iberico pork with dragon fruit & caramelised cashews ($208)Golden seafood fried rice & salted duck yolk ($188)Foie gras & wagyu beef stone pot fried rice ($235)Jasmine tea ($48 per pot)It was welcoming there were not other add-ons you'd often get at Chinese restaurants (e.g. ""peanuts"" appetisers).Chrysanthemum ""thousand cut"" silken tofu in chicken broth...$ 1080Chrysanthemum ""thousand cut"" silken tofu in chicken broth...$ 108Chrysanthemum ""thousand cut"" silken tofu in chicken broth - stunning to look at and just as great in taste. Only gripe is the shape of the bowl made it hard to finish the last sip of the soup and to scoop up the last bits of tofu.Hokkaido king crab & sea urchin spring rolls$ 1180Hokkaido king crab & sea urchin spring rolls$ 118Hokkaido king crab & sea urchin spring rolls - a unique take on the good old spring roll. This was probably my favourite of all dishes - filled with crab meat and a refreshing sea urchin on top. With dishes like this, there is sometimes the dreaded contrast in temperature between cool filling (or topping) and hot pastry. No issues with this one. Nor did it feel oily at all.Garoupa fillet with spring onion and ginger Cheung Fun Rice Rolls/ Taro Puffs with aubergine and salted fish...$ 580Garoupa fillet with spring onion and ginger Cheung Fun Rice Rolls/ Taro Puffs with aubergine and salted fish...$ 58The Garoupa Cheung Fun was certainly a unique take on this Cantonese classic. Large thick pieces of fish wrapped in an overall well-made Cheung Fun. Two quintessential cantonese offerings (steamed fish and cheung fun) fused into one. Perfect. Two birds with one stone?Taro balls were also delish! The taste of aubergine (aka eggplant) in the taro puff went well with only the slightest hint of salted fish (which is great, in my books, as salted fish could easily overwhelm other flavours). Again, didn't feel oily at all.Sweet & sour Iberico pork with dragon fruit & caramelised cashews ...$ 2080Sweet & sour Iberico pork with dragon fruit & caramelised cashews ...$ 208Sweet and sour pork is a staple of my Chinese cuisine - have always liked the general flavour. This one had a very controlled flavouring - one which does not scream acidic (vinegar) nor overly sweet (or sticky). The meat was on the lean side with a bit more bite than your usual offering, which I relate to the Iberico pork. Might I suggest a few more dragonfruit ""flowers"" to carry its name? Portion of the meat was generous and something I would be keen to order again.Foie gras & wagyu beef stone pot fried rice$ 2350Foie gras & wagyu beef stone pot fried rice$ 235This is the foie gras and wagyu beef fried rice. As with the other fried rice we ordered, portions equate to four of these small bowls - on the small side really (I'd have expected the equivalent of five as a standard portion). Flavour was great though, with the Golden seafood fried rice & salted duck yolk being the universal favourite.It was evident throughout the meal they were striving for five star service (which one would expect given the price) - wait staff kept control of the tea pot and refilled our cups whenever appropriate. My cup was empty for a good 10 minutes toward end of meal though, and the restaurant was far from busy, so it would be interesting to see if they would keep up when there is a full house (which I understand there has been, in the evenings). They should also check on the tea pots as tea always leaked onto the table when the staff were pouring (kudos that they came back to wipe the table dry after). Staff were polite, willing to help and visibly careful in what they were doing. As mentioned above, they kept great tab of our dining progress to keep the food coming at good intervals. However, if it was not because it is still 'new', I would have given this 3 stars for the above handful of things which I would not otherwise expect at this price point. Hygiene was generally good except for a plate I received with water marks (you could see it in the photo above).Overall, it was a positive experience, with quite a number of items on the menu I would definitely and unreservedly recommend. Seating was comfortable and the ambiance suitable for the food. Air conditioning was weak (to the extent I felt there was none towards the end of meal). But the greatest disconnect would be its price (especially taking into account its location, for a weekday lunch) and service (which needs warming up). Cheaper and more convenient alternatives could be had for a similar price and impression in central Central (Clipper Lounge would be cheaper and Cafe Causette would be similar).",The Chinese Library,4.3,380,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-the-chinese-library/590531?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

Central,Chinese," (English name : Tsim Chai Kee Noodle) is a perhaps one of my favorite places to have noodles when I'm in Central. And apparently, so did the Michelin Guide as it's listed in one of it's recommended places to eat in Hong Kong. Located literally across the street from the famous more tourist crowded Mak's Noodles, I honestly prefer Tsim Chai Kee to Mak's and I tell my tourist friends to go here instead.A small noodle shop that sells three basic items: wonton, fish balls and sliced beef. Menu is in English and Chinese. There is no 10% service charge.0The noodles I always order is this. A double whammy of wonton and fish balls for an inexpensive $37. Portion size is alright. It's not too big and not miniscule in size like Mak's. The wontons are large with a good mixture of pork meat and one huge shrimp wrapped around a thin wrapping. But my favorite? The HUGE HUGE fish balls made from dace. They are so big they always make me smile from the size. And they are fantastic. Unlike other places that use dace meat, a fish that has a lot of bones, there are hardly found in their balls. The balls are firm and has that nice bouncy texture. The soup is a clear shrimp based broth though there is a bit of MSG detected. The noodles are firm and perfectly al dente.0So, if you see a long line at Mak's Noodles, perhaps try this one across the street.

Still, we believed that it was better than plain rice with the mushrooms and dried scallops.For desserts, we chose sweetened almond cream and ginger creme brulee.Sweetened Almond Cream0Sweetened Almond CreamI could tell from the texture that it was freshly ground. It was not overly sweet.Ginger Creme Brulee0Ginger Creme BruleeIt was quite interesting that such a French dessert was offered in a Chinese set lunch. There was indeed some ginger flavour.

Very good indeed.$ 750$ 75There was plenty of soup inside while the wrap was not too thick either. Although the price was not cheap (about $15 each), it was ok.$ 530$ 53They were quite crispy. Unfortunately, there wasn't much spinach flavour. There was also some meat inside which I hadn't expected but there was no complaint about this.$ 750$ 75This one was very very bad. There was no swallow's nest as expected. But the biggest problem was that the custard wasn't flowing at all! Their presentation didn't justify $75 at all!We also tried 3 mains.$ 1080$ 108This one was very delicious. There were quite a lot of tenderloin cubes and they were well seasoned. Even the potato cubes tasted good.$ 971$ 97This one was quite good. The portion of the pork was quite big and they did have crispy texture and were well seasoned. The only complaint was that the pork lacked rich pork flavour.$ 750$ 75The fish was bigger than thought as we had expected a really small fish from its name. The fish was pretty fresh. The minced ginger was a bit salty though. Overall, quite a good value for money.We ordered one dessert to share.$ 750$ 75$ 750$ 75$ 750$ 75We were amazed when it was served to us and a cost of $68+10% seemed such a great value for money. But then when we found out the Chinese tea was really just Chinese tea with nothing special, $68+10% for 6 small black sesame dumplings was really such a big joke. Sorry that I had really expected some  sweet soup to go along with the rice dumplings...Service was a bit slow toward the end when we kept asking for our dessert and the bill. Overall, the mains seemed better and offered a better value for money while the dim sum didn't seem to be so. Maybe we had picked some wrong dim sum.

Central,Chinese,"After spending two hours walking around Tai Kwun highlighted by a personal tour from none other than Jelloman's dad who used to work here more than 30 years ago, it was finally time for lunch. Being the well-organized person that I'm, I've already got our lunch plans all figured out. In fact, I have secured a table at Old Bailey (), a new restaurant by JIA Group over a month ago.0First impressions are always important and we have a very good one here, with everyone loving the way they decorate the space with a lot of wood. And it never hurts to have plenty of natural light too (though it's been a rainy day so far).0At the front end of Old Bailey, they have this small bar area serving alcohol, coffee and tea along with a small list of refreshment. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that their tea and cakes were actually supplied by Teakha ().1While I waited for the rest of the party to show up, I went out to the restaurant's L-shaped balcony to get a breath of fresh air. I really enjoyed walking around this balcony. Not only does it have a very nice view of a quiet corner of Tai Kwun, it provides more than enough space for kids to run around.0This latest venture by JIA Group will tackle regional Jiangnan cuisine, bringing flavors from south of the Yangtze River including Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Ningbo, Yangzhou and Suzhou all together.0Marinated eggs, fermented rice wine () ($68) - It was nice to see marinated eggs on the menu after our recent run of tea smoked eggs.

Central,Chinese,"Our Fathers Day Lunch was ruined by this restaurant. What happened?? The restaurant did set lunches for Fathers day, we all ordered from the set menu thinking nothing can go wrong when a restaurant can prepare everything in advanced. We were wrong.....It took 1 hour for starters to come (pre-made salad & dimsum). Took another 1 hour for our mains to be served, whilst for our fathers it took an extra 30mins for their mains to be served (yes, you are right, it took a total of 2.5hours for starters and mains to be served for them). We were frankly frustrated because two of our diners had another event to go to so we asked them if they could serve a little faster...The manager came out and said we were the only table with an issue, and hinted it must be our problem (yes, I was shocked too when I heard that coming out of her mouth). We asked if she could follow up with the food, and guess what.... she said if she did not spend time talking to us she could have followed up with the food already....  just when you thought it couldnt get any worse...It ended up taking another 1 hour for its desserts to be served. Ive been Chinese all my life and have never had a dim sum lunch where it took 3.5hours; had the ability to piss off all the people we were trying to celebrate for, and the diners had to take attitude from the manager. I asked to speak to the general manager, turns out he wasnt at work, I guess thats why management was so poor... there was none. Frankly, I feel bad for the waiters and waitresses, there is no system, they were serving like a headless chicken only. Maybe we were a table of 10, thats why a place with almost no management or system in place completely failed to cope with it. I hope they dont screw up small table orders the way they screw up ours, and I really hope the management team reflects on this. Just by observing how they operated this afternoon even someone like me with no f&b management experience can think of a few ways for them to improve on. These comments can help their business if they do the right things down the road.

This is my favourite vegetarian takeaway restaurants in central. The food is so flavourful and fresh! At the front of the restaurant there is a display of todays food choices, usually there is 13 daily dish options and you can pick 2 or 3. Here is what I choose and my feedback:  Fried Tofu - fresh and cooked really well. Has a really nice soy sauce with it. Scrambled Egg with vegetables - not oily but really soft and creamy. There was a generous amount. Broccoli with Lotus Roots - crunchy cooked with ginger and garlic. For non Chinese speaking foodies, you may shy away from these places because you can read or dont know how to speak the language. But you are missing out! Let me teach you how to order here and you dont need to know chinese As mentioned there is a display of todays dish choices at the entrance of the restaurant. Each dish has a number attached. Tell the person at the front of the restaurant you 2 or 3 number dishes choices. They understand English. Once youve ordered and paid. They would give you a number, which you can ask them to write down. Once your order is ready, they would shout out your number or personally let you know.

In the middle of the restaurant, there's a tennis table. The table is good for large number of guests. Sofa seats near the open kitchen area was offered to us, lucky it was not noisy. 2The bowls is so funny, it is either ants or flies. My bowl was crawling ants. The ants was not 3D, it was painted. 0Back to the food, there are many options on the menu and it took us quite a while before we could decide what to try.Signature DishesWe order 3 signature dishes to try.Signature Roasted WhiteKing Pigeon $29@Signature Roasted White King Pigeon$ 290Signature Roasted White King Pigeon$ 29Mini gloves and hand wipes were offered to eat it. Mini gloves is an excellent idea! Wearing them to eat pigeon, our hands will not get dirty. The pigeon is meaty and juicy...the skin is very crispy. It does not taste like it was prepared and waiting to be served...it taste like freshly made . On the first bite, the pigeon meat is so hot and the meat tears out easily with juice leaking out.

You need to choose items from section A and B. Section A (3 items, choose 1) are cold starters. The drunken chicken have a strong alcohol smell and taste. The meat is tender and smooth. Section B(16 items, choose 2). Ivy mosses with Jellyfish () is also a cold plate. Ivy mosses and jellyfish () is so . The sauce is sesame oil and soy sauce, it was not too salty with a tint of spicy..refreshing cold plate. Season chicken & Noodles Salad. Remember to mix the chicken and noodles smoothly! The sauce is similar to Ivy mosses with Jellyfish except we can also taste peanut butter. The noodles is smooth and chewy.0Dim SumThe dim sum is innovative and nicely decorated. I love all the buns we ordered, it is so delicious.Steamed Apple Buns (3pcs) $49Steamed Apple Buns (3pcs)$ 490Steamed Apple Buns (3pcs)$ 49The buns is so cute!!! 3 mini green buns served in a basket.

The chili sauce made the dumplings irresistible.DessertThe ""Bayberry"" with Custard Fillings (3pcs) $39The ""Bayberry"" with Custard Fillings (3pcs) $ 390The ""Bayberry"" with Custard Fillings (3pcs) $ 39Itlooks like a cherry tomato with sugar bits. We thought the skin was soft but to our surprise it was deep fried. The leafs is mint. Even with the sugar bits, it was not sweet at all. For those who like mint leaves, you could consider eating the leafs along with the dessert.Overall, we enjoy the dim sum and commented every dishes we ate. Will introduce to those who have not yet tried to come. Food in here is worth trying...it is more than just dim sum.

Central,Chinese,"I am sure that there are enough commentaries on how good their Kikusan Rolls are. But there may not be any commentary about how they are like without uni. And how fortunate that we came across Kikusan Rolls without uni as we were told that they were running out of uni...Kikusan Rolls without uni$ 750Kikusan Rolls without uni$ 75I didn't think they added more minced toro to make up for the lack of uni as promised, maybe just salmon roe. Having said that, I think they still tasted good. The salmon roe was not salty at all while the minced toro was pretty smooth. I also liked the onions served on top! Yet I could only give an average rating for the disappointment due to the lack of uni, which definitely dragged down the value for money of this dish. Steamed Pork & Soup Dumpling$ 530 Steamed Pork & Soup Dumpling$ 53The dumplings I ate broke easily so that some soup leaked out. Otherwise they tasted quite good with loads of soup and reasonably thick wrap. Chilli Sesame & Peanut Soup Ramen with Minced Pork & Layer Pork Cutlet...$ 790 Chilli Sesame & Peanut Soup Ramen with Minced Pork & Layer Pork Cutlet...$ 79The layer pork cutlet was good, with thin batter and reasonably tender pork chop. The soup was slightly chilli which was of a good degree but it didn't have enough peanut flavour which was quite a failure for a traditional peanut soup ramen like this. The ramen itself was quite sub-par too, which was not al dente at all... Steamed Spinach Wrap Shrimp Dumpling$ 460 Steamed Spinach Wrap Shrimp Dumpling$ 46The one was quite good. The wrap was refreshing although didn't offer sufficiently strong spinach flavour. The shrimp filling was big and meaty! Yummy! Grilled Eel with Rice$ 1520 Grilled Eel with Rice$ 152It was served pretty hot! The eel was reasonably good, with thick skin and of quite a generous portion. The rice was quite hot with abundant yummy sauce. Green Tea Glutinous Rice Pancake with Red Bean Filling...$ 420 Green Tea Glutinous Rice Pancake with Red Bean Filling...$ 42Last time we tried glutinous rice pancake with peanut and black sesame filling which was really good. This time we decided to try this one. But it really lacked green tea or red bean flavour...Only the crispy nuts were good. It was very disappointing. The only good thing was that it was not too sweet due to the lack of green tea/red bean flavour... Chargrilled Beef$ 1630 Chargrilled Beef$ 163This one came last because we ordered it quite late. It was the worst dish of the day. We were a bit surprised that a steak came out instead of just normal beef. But it was totally lack of chargrilled flavour and it was so rough. It was really bad and we had to finish it off with the accompanying sauce.Overall, it was still a good place to go given its convenient location and reasonable price. Just that maybe it's better to stick to its signature dishes and don't try new dishes.

This one seemed to be a must-order dish as it was one of their signature dishes. The spring rolls were crispy as always with a lot of fillings. The only complaint was that the ingredients were not so evenly spread so that some rolls contained more shrimps than others. They were a bit dry so it was better to eat them with the sauces coming along which included spicy sauce and vinegar.

The eggs smelt and tasted really strong in hua diao which made the egg custard taste quite good. The flat noodles were just standard. Stewed ox tail in special sauce$ 860 Stewed ox tail in special sauce$ 86This was the best of all the mains we had. The ox tail was really very tender which was so easy to break apart to share. The special sauce was actually ! yummy!

Then they brought it to us again before our last dish of the mains arrived...Anyway, it was ok for me to just finish it then as we were almost done. The bowl was really hot when served but surprisingly the pudding itself was just warm. A bit weird. The only comment I had on this was . I found this dessert a very good value for money! Braised pomelo peel with dried shrimp roe$ 1190 Braised pomelo peel with dried shrimp roe$ 119The sauce seemed to be free of MSG/ salt and we could tell that it had been prepared using some .

Yummy!Overall, I had expected better overall food quality given the prices but it seemed that most of the costs had gone to the rent. Sub-par services during lunch had been well expected given its prime location so I really didn't have too much complaint about service.

Central,Chinese,"If youre working, it takes a lot of planning to ensure you can get here on time before they close at 1.15pm. Finally was able to be here! Before we sat down, the lady told us that they had ran out of the toast and we could only order the noodles. Though disappointed, we continued to order our noodles and realised that everyone (about 10 people before us) was waiting for their food.Its great to come in winter because its cool and we simply waited and chatted among ourselves. After observing, we realised we were the last customers and kind of lamented that we need to come earlier in future to try their toast.I think the lady may have overheard our conversation and to our surprise, she actually came to us later and told us discreetly that the owner said he could prepare one portion of the toast for us! We were so touched and figured out that they probably overheard us speaking in English and knew we were not locals. And because we were the last customers, he probably knew he had some ingredients and could spend the time leisurely preparing for us.So thanks to their kindness, we had the opportunity to try the super decadent corned beef omelette with cheese toast that was filled with lettuce and peanut butter. Sounds strange in words but tasted sooooo good together so was the fluffy luncheon meat omelette with instant noodle that was filled with so much cabbage and so satisfying to devour on a cold winter afternoon.Thank you Yue Hing, for that authentic taste and warm friendly service that even a 1-hr wait for the food is no big deal010",Yue Hing,nan,60,45,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-yue-hing/14243?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

So... while you may want to get here early to beat the crowds, don't get here too early...The specialties of this place is obviously the roasted meats. There are several of them here, but I went with the duck, since it looked pretty good. Honestly though, I didn't feel like this place was anything special from other unknown places which serve roast meats. Guess the michelin star standards are somewhat lax these days?However, this place should be commended for the fact that they've managed to stay in business all this time. Central has obviously been the center of financial activity in Hong Kong, and so obviously the attractions and business in the area have changed to become a slightly more 'international' flavor- still, I feel like this trend has picked up a little bit in the past couple of years.

To be honest, it is only a chain restaurant instead of fine dining, I think according to the price, their food is fine.They are doing a promotion for the new food item, $33 for the rice in lotus leaf and a hot drink. I am a fans of this and there is no reason of not trying. The portion is alright, maybe not enough for guy but I am quite sure most ladies can't finish the whole. It is warm instead of hot which is a bit disappointing, I guess because of lunch hour so they take out the food for a faster service.The rice itself is good, not too salty but has flavor. Got quite a lot of mushroom, some dried shrimp and pork. I am not a meat lover so the amount of meat is just fine.Not the best rice but from the price, it is better than average.

Central,Chinese,"This famous traditional Cantonese wonton noodle restaurant is located in Central, but also got a number of branches in other districts. I used to frequent more the one in Tin Hau where I lived before, and it was the first time in fact I visited the one in Wellington Street.The decoration is also a bit different, more elegant, neat and got a bit of original feel, such as the traditional tea cup they use instead of the more common plastic ones you saw in most Chinese cafe. The place is bright, clean and well-managed, and since it was early (about 11:30am) not too busy yet. 0I ordered the Wonton Noodle to start, while Ivy went for the Beef Tendon and Wonton Noodle. Yes, the portion is small, but that is the right size per the original serving. The noodle has the perfect texture, got a nice bite, and the clear soup was very good, full of flavors and delicious. Of course the wonton is their signature, with the shrimp very crunchy, with each wonton of bite size and having the right balance of shrimp and pork. Definitely one of the best wonton noodles in town in my opinion.As the portion is not big enough for me, as my routine I ordered another Dumpling Noodle. The same noodle and soup base, but instead of the smaller wonton the dumplings are larger, with the wood mushroom further adding the crunchy texture for enjoyment. It is equally tasty.With the three noodle and nothing else, the bill was $142. For many they would say it was a bit expensive, but nowadays considering you have to pay $100 for a Japanese ramen, I would not undermine the value and all the effort in making this wonton noodle, so for me it is of reasonable value for money.My overall rating is 63/100.",Mak's Noodle,3.6,71,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-maks-noodle/1998?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

Central,Chinese,"This is my second visit to the restaurant as I wanted to take my family to try something different from the average dim sum restaurant. We ordered 5 types of dimsum and 3 dishes, which was enough for 4 adults.My fave was the steamed vegetable dumpling with truffle (), we ordered 2 of these. Allow thedumpling to just cool slightly before consuming as the skin then tends to have a little more bite (like glutinous rice).Do notexpect to really taste thechopped vegetable filling as the truffle taste was quite strong, though not considered overpowering.0The presentation of the pineapple pastry ()was nice, coming to the table in a little birdcage, but it looked better than it tasted. The pastry was nice and crumbly, but the pineapple jam filling was overly sweet and tastedas if pineapple essence or flavoring was used. This is not something I will order again.1Buns in this restaurant come in cute little designs. The barbequed pork bun () came in the shape ofa white piggy face whilst the molten custard bun ()were little orange bunswith eyes. Both had nice soft buns and the custard cream was not overly sweet with a slightly saltiness to it.00The shrimp dumplings () had a generous portion of prawns and tasted fine, but was unspectacular. I willprefer if theyhad left out the coloring and gold leafwhich added nothing to the flavor of the dumplings.1I did not taste thespicy turnip cake (), but it was one ofa handful of turnip cakes from dimsum restaurants that my momfound acceptable. One of the pluses is that it did not come to the table doused in oil.0The fried squid tentacles () was thankfully not overcooked, but the batter was unfortunately more oily than crispy during consumption.0Their version of the fried french beans () came with a little twist - it was coated in salted egg yolk. This was another favorite, as the beans were not softbut just cooked enough to lose the raw taste. The only fault may be that it was just asmidge over-salted, but that was to be expected with salted egg.0Service was friendly and fairly attentive.

Central,Chinese,"I needed to do a couple of things in Central this afternoon and with my little nugget around, fine dining won't be an option but luckily, there are tons of dining options around here including Dragon Noodle Academy (), a place that I've been waiting to check out personally.At first, I thought they are a noodle place (judging from its name) but they turned out to be much more. Imagine a lobster themed dim sum and noodle joint with a dark dungeon vibe and a bit of kungfu twist. That pretty much sums it up.0We were pleasantly surprised that they're still open for lunch after half past two. It was right after we got seated that we were told the restaurant actually opens from 11:30AM to 11PM without stoppage but the food menu does change ever so slightly after lunch hours with less dim sum to offer.0I'm all for the throwback theme. The city definitely needs more of these kind of restaurants.0I got some stuff to play with before our food arrives.....0Dragon Noodle Academy probably gets its name from two of their signature items - Dragon (presumably lobster, which is pronounced ""dragon prawn"" in Chinese) and noodle but they're far from a one-trick pony. I heard they have a pretty good peking duck too (marinating in the oven now). 0First, some homemade camomile tea to quench my thirst. Thought it tasted a little weird but then I'm never a big fan of tea to begin with.0Seasonal vegetables in soup () ($79) - Something healthy before the funky stuff arrives.

The company was great, and the food was top-notch (I would recommend in particular the iberico roast pork and the peking duck, both of which must be pre-ordered, as well as the Sichuan-style fried chicken and the scallop/prawn dumpling). The service was also generally impeccable with people refilling tea and water often and being polite and courteous with us.The problem arose when it was time for dessert. Most of us ordered ice cream, but it took over 15 minutes for the ice cream to arrive. As the minutes went by I became more anxious as I had another appointment, and asked for my ice cream to be served in a takeaway package. 10 minutes later the ice cream arrived, literally as I was getting up to leave. I asked again for my ice cream to be put in a takeaway box and a male manager very rudely and abruptly said, while staring daggers at me, ""ICE CREAM NO TAKEAWAY.""I didn't have time to argue with him as I actually did have to leave, but the restaurant's slowness in serving ice cream (what, were they making it from scratch back in the kitchen??) and the manager's rudeness really left a poor taste in my mouth. Had I had time I would have demanded a refund because it's ridiculous that they don't have e.g. Styrofoam bowls to serve ice cream takeaway and also it was totally unnecessary for the manager to have been so rude. (I was neutral in my tone and demeanor so it wasn't like I provoked or deserved that type of response.)  Also, when I first asked for my ice cream to be put in a takeaway box no one said that would not be possible.As it is, we had to pay HK$99 (45 per scoop plus 10% service charge) for ice cream that went wasted because the restaurant staff were too slow in serving ice cream and too inflexible to serve it takeaway.

Central,Chinese,"2If I were to pick a particular kind of noodles to represent Hong Kong, I would give my vote to this unique and comforting noodles in condensed tomato broth other than cart noodles () that would have come to your mind. Thick broth is always the soul of noodles, regardless of whatever ingredients to be put inside. To pair pho with vietnam, ramen with japanese, boat noodles with thai, then Sing Heung Yuen's tomato noodles with Hong Kong.0Tucked away in an open space linking to a staircase at the back streets of Central-Sheungwan area, the halfly al fresco eatery is all the time busy. With canvas as shelters and placed with simple stools and wooden tables, the ""daipaidong"" stood there for more than 40 years, but it wasn't until 2000 that they started specialising in tomato broth dishes.0There aren't many food stalls like this remaining in Hong Kong, the license of which stemmed from wartime Hong Kong and was only given to families with injured civil servants with limited transfer of ownership. Originally operating as an all-round Chinese eatery serving a variety of cha chaan teng food, it added tomato slices to a bowl of noodles as requested by a customer, which in turn creates the legend of tomato broth noodles. At an average price of $35 for a bowl which is on a par with a meal box in fast food shop, it brings locals who desperately need an affordable meal, and tourists/ holiday commuters who are drawn by the fame of divine goodness of broth.Kitchen0KitchenAmong daipaidongs that I have ever visited, hygiene condition of this is way above average. Apparently looking fine on a sunny day that I paid this visit, it doesn't look that bad on rainy days either. Canvas above you do its job well to shelter you away from the rain but at the same time don't shed water on your back. While tables, stools and metal fans are gone when the shop closes, these green shacks remain, which are in fact the indispensable part, the Kitchen.Kitchen0KitchenNoodles are prepared in one side, the space of which is just fit for 1-2 ladies' moving around. Another side is for roasting crispy bun and preparing sandwiches. Given such a petite kitchen and limited staff, the food stall is operated smoothly with high efficiency. Sun or rain may determine how long you have to wait to be seated, but time and season doesn't really matter. With nearly flawless memories of the ladies, your order is usually served within 10 minutes after getting seated.0The menu seems to be long, but in fact just repeats combinations of ingredients, the price of which mainly varies with number of ingredients. The exuberant menu covers noodles with/without tomato broth, sandwiches, buns and drinks. What to be put inside noodles are common enough to be found elsewhere, such as beef, ham, sausages, luncheon meat, pork chop and chicken wings. Noodles served after breakfast time are instant noodles and macaroni.0 Macaroni with tomato, scrambled eggs with corned beef and beef $35  - Macaroni with tomato, scrambled eggs with corned beef and beef...$ 352  - Macaroni with tomato, scrambled eggs with corned beef and beef...$ 35A vibrant bowl of red greeted me, however red to the extent that it looks a bit eccentric to be edible. There lies no doubt of its genuine tomato content, which is a hearty mix of several types of canned tomatoes with variance in sweetness/ acidity. 0About the broth - Not much oil floats around, just a little bit probably from the scrambled eggs. What makes the fame is how thick the tomato broth is, which is not made by adding tomato slices or concentrate into boiled water. Pot of delectable tomato soup is cooked every day with lots of tomatoes, thus giving such a visually-inspiring red broth with plenty of tomato slices. The broth tastes tangy and superbly refreshing, without much add-on of artificial sweetness.Tomato and macaroni0Tomato and macaroniAbout the other ingredients - Beef and scrambled eggs with corned beef are my all-time favourites that never disappoint. Eggs with finely chopped beef is mildly fried and scrambled, therefore it can't be firm enough to be held long on a spoon or chopsticks. Permeated with aroma of not totally done egg and briny beef, pieces of scrambled eggs are blended beautifully, so flavourful on its own that neither egg nor beef overpowers each other. - Scrambled egg with corned beef0 - Scrambled egg with corned beefBeefis always tender and without tendon, which nearly melts in your mouth with a sip of tomato broth. Smooth and gentle, there lies no necessity to linger long in your mouth but swallow. Robust beef flavour remains from plain beef slices, which suggests 'less is more'. - Beef0 - Beef Butter & Honey with Lemon Crispy Bun $16 - Butter & Honey with Lemon Crispy Bun$ 162 - Butter & Honey with Lemon Crispy Bun$ 16Adding sandwiches to a bowl of noodles will be too much, but never say no to a crispy bun which is without substantial toppings that make you full. Firstly roasted to make it crispy and applied a thin spread of lemon honey, the bun tastes zesty and is easy to consume even without a sip of soup or drinks. Slices of four are not difficult to handle, or you may put it as the bread to go with the soup just like appetisers. Crispy on the exterior and slightly tender inside, a simple spread makes an elevated spin by the utter freshness of acidic lemon.00It is not a surprise that most of us finish off the tomato broth like this. Just like ramen, it seems to be paying tribute to the chef, but it is genuinely decadent instead of courtesy that makes me drink it all up. Hearty noodles as always, Sing Heung Yuen is one (among several) of my favourite local eateries where I long for a visit at desperate times.

Central,Chinese,"I was Ahab, and learning how to cook eggs the way Lok Heung Yuen does for their Char Siew Scrambled Egg Rice was my metaphorical White Whale. Do you remember the last thing you obsessed over, something you needed so bad that it would drive you insane otherwise? It could be small and irrelevant, yet you know you will never have peace of mind until the situation is resolved. I have been dining at Lok Heung Yuen for the better part of three years, and for the past three years, I have been totally fixated on learning how to cook eggs the way they do in their char siew scrambled egg rice (HK$38). Over the years, I have added a variety of ingredients (From corn starch to chicken stock) in my scrambled eggs in hopes of achieving the same results; and for three years straight, I have failed.Every chef worth his pinch of salt has a signature egg dish. Jean Georges serves scrambled eggs with vodka cream and a heap of caviar; Alain Passard serves his poached egg yolks in a shell with maple and vinegar, and Dave Chang water smokes his and serves it with potato chips. For me, the eggs in this humble coffee shop may be the verybest in Hong Kong, better than the numerous Michelin starred establishments and hipster friendly coffee brunch restaurants. Brave the Central lunchtime queues and you will be rewarded with one of the most exquisite one-plate meals in the city.The eggs are flash cooked (literally no more than a minute) until they are just set, the tender ribbony wisps of cooked egg giving way to succulent pieces of char siew, while the spring onions give the whole plate a bit of sharpness and colour. But most incredibly, the eggs curds remain gooey and runny enough to gently coat and lubricate every single grain of rice. There is no other way to put this, but this plate of char siew egg rice hits the spot  The rest of the menu, consisting of various pastries and other classic teahouse dishes, is well-executed, but remain non-events. Still, when nine out of ten people in a restaurant orders the same dish each time, it makes littlesense to deviate from the norm.I have a tumultuous love-hate relationship with the place - I love, wholeheartedly love how it cooks the humble egg so perfectly, but I detest the fact that it seemingly refuses to share its secrets on cooking the perfect egg. Try to peer into the open kitchen from your seat and there is a 5 foot tall counter obstructing your view; ask the friendly familyin charge for a recipe and all you get is a mute toothy grinand a shake of the head in return. Even now, I have no clue what goes in the egg mix, other than the fact that it must contain some form of liquid to thin out and smoothen the mixture. I still continue to pry around, hopefully to learn a clue or two, but I have the sinking feeling that the onlyway to get these perfect eggs is to visit the restaurant and brave the long queues.Char Siew Scrambled Egg Rice$ 381Char Siew Scrambled Egg Rice$ 38Supplementary Information*For more posts on cheap eats in Hong Kong, please visit wongeatshongkong.wordpress.com",Lok Heung Yuen Coffee Shop,nan,50,5,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-lok-heung-yuen-coffee-shop/31445?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

Central,Chinese,"0I love that Hong Kong is a central hub for many flights coming from Europe to Australia (or vice versa). It means that we often have friends stopping by, sometimes for a few days and other times for just 24 hours. One of the girl's great friends and her family were coming back from a family holiday and managed to spend a fun filled day in our new city.We're no strangers to having meals with Fi and Kev, with the girl and Fi having regular get togethers in the Indian restaurants of Brisbane. I'd even bumped into Kev in the UK one time and we shared an interesting dinner at Two Michelin starred Hibiscus (see post here). For this short trip, we'd arranged two dining extravaganzas, the first of which was at one of Hong Kong's most interesting and fun Chinese restaurants, Yum Cha.Now, yum cha is both the name of a restaurant and also a style of cuisine, which roughly translates to 'drink tea' and/or 'going for dim sum' - small, bite sized portions of Cantonese cuisine. What makes Yum Cha the restaurant so incredible is the fun and unique manner in which they present their dim sum. In fact, some of the dim sum is so interesting to look at, it's almost a shame to eat!Covering a massive 6,000 square feet on the fringes of Central, Yum Cha distinguishes itself with it's high ceilings that are reminiscent of a New York style loft. With it's high ceilings and large windows, there is a bright and airy feel to the dining area. What I loved as I wandered up the escalators to the entrance of Yum Cha was the full scale truck that dominated the entrance and was used for displaying the restaurant's opening times (of course, seems legit!)0Chef Winson Yip is the head chef of Yum Cha and has been responsible for creating some of the most Instagram worthy food seen on the net. The philosophy at Yum Cha is to serve traditional Chinese dishes and dim sum but with a very modern twist. The team proudly pronounce that their food is infused with a playfulness that maintains traditional flavours and most importantly, is free of MSG.We'd made a booking for lunch and arrived right on our allotted time, but were disappointed to note that our table had been given away already. So much for a booking system. Thankfully, the team were able to find a table, albeit a little small for our groups number of six - ahhh, what are you gonna do - this is Hong Kong. Everything's cramped, so why not our table for lunch.With an eclectic group at the table that included pescatarians and vegetarians, along with fully fledged meat eaters and with Fi recovering from a bout of food poisoning, we took to the the comprehensive Yum Cha menu with gusto, ordering a raft of dim sum and other Chinese delicacies with a view to keeping everyone happy. Before too long, we had round after round of food delivered to our table and I got busy taking photos of some of the cute looking food.I'm gonna talk about our food quite out of order for this post, mainly because I was so enamoured with some of the dishes, that were indeed crying out for posting to Instagram.With a degree of cuteness that was almost overpowering, we loved the BBQ piggy pork buns that when presented to the table looked like three little pigs trying to escape from a future that they knew all too well. Like the fates of the three little pigs in Red Riding Hood, the fate of our cute shaped pork buns was pre determined! Munch and crunch, our little piggies were devoured and the sweet pork filling tasting as delicious on our palates as they had been visually.1Just as cute were the hot custard buns that resembled a cross between the heads of minions and a Sesame Street character. With beady little eyes that gave the appearance of staring off vacantly into space, our little custard buns obviously knew that their fate was to be aligned with the little piggy pork buns. The hot custard inside the buns was bright orange and oh-so-sweet. Very much the dessert option from our meal, the table was completely enamoured with the treats; but no so much that we didn't devour them in seconds.1While the piggy pork buns and the hot custard buns were the most visually appealing dim sum from our meal, there was also a serious side to chef Winson's menu and I particularly loved the translucent shrimp dumpling, which were lovely and sweet; as well as the very traditional crab roe and pork dumplings, which were covered in vibrant orange roe. The sweet pork contrasting nicely with the salty roe.00I wasn't a huge fan of the sticky rice dumplings, but I had to admit that the looked quite lovely. Luckily, it wasn't all about me and the sticky dumplings were quickly devoured by the non meat eaters at the table! The naked vegetable dumplings were also a hit for the vegetarians at the table, although I admit to not trying the dish because -well, they were vegetables!00There were some other traditional Chinese dishes that we tried as well, oh, when I say we, I mean Fi, Kev and the girls. Broiled cabbage and crab roe sesame spinach are not really food substances that I'm going to eat too readily, but it was fair to say that they were appreciated by our weary travelling friends who'd not been long off their flight.000It was my first visit to Yum Cha and I found the dim sum to be tasty and very entertaining. The girl had been a number of times with her workmates, with the location perfectly located for office workers to get their lunchtime dim sum hit.It's probably not a restaurant that I'd add to my regular roster for dining out, firstly, it's a little far out of my way and secondly, while I did quite like the novelty factor, my favourite spot to eat Chinese remains Din Tai Fung.However, this is a place that you have to try out, for the kitsch factor alone - those BBQ piggy pork buns have to be the best thing I've seen in food for a long time - so cute. I'm positive that Yum Cha will be incredibly popular with local Hong Kongers and is definitely a spot that if you're in HK for only a short time is worth checking out.@FoodMeUpScotty0Ahhh, nothing like a local beer after a long flight!0Even our bowls were cute with little goldfish baked inThe Dim Sum at Yum Cha - so pretty and cute010Yum Cha is light and airy - like a NYC Loft000Supplementary InformationGet your camera ready - you need to post to Instagram",Yum Cha,3.3,600,5,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-yum-cha/475054?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

Central,Chinese,"So this was my first goose experience. I have been to Hong Kong more times than I care to remember but had, for some reason, never had goose.We went at 3pm and there was no wait at all. They have a menu in English if you cannot speak Cantonese and the prices are no different to the Cantonese menu.The interior is typically Hong Kong and very clean except the odd bit of grease on the floor but that is normal.The goose skin here is nice and crispy unlike Kams. the meat is also really good. there is a lot of flavour to both parts and a half goose is a great way to try different parts of the goose in one go. There was not too much fat as this had obviously rendered out during cooking. The plum sauce that came with it was very good indeed. The also offer a home made sweet soy sauce which is unlike anything I have ever tasted. I wish I could have taken the entire bowl of it with me.A half goose was 250HKD and rice and drinks were very reasonable indeed.

Central,Chinese,"A couple Saturdays ago, we were having dinner at grandma's, and my aunt said that we were only waitlisted for the dim sum place she booked for the next day. We decided to look for another venue for our dim sum lunch, and my brother and I suggested we go to Heichinrou in Central since it's usually not as crowded on the weekends. We called the restaurant and were able to book a table for the 8 of us right away.My uncle who knows the restaurant pretty well told us that they have a special Dim Sum set lunch on weekends and public holidays that's a pretty good deal, so we already knew we were going to order the set before hand.It was pouring heavily that day, so while most of us were able to get to the restaurant on time, my aunt who has a preference for parking venues had trouble looking for parking and her family didn't get to the restaurant till a little later. The rest of us that were waiting decided to order a few items from the Chef Special Dishes menu.1Items from the Chef Special Dishes Menu were on display in the main dining area of the restaurant, so we could take a look at the items before ordering.11Fish Ball, Pig Skin, Radish$ 651Fish Ball, Pig Skin, Radish$ 65Fish Ball, Pig Skin, Radish: We ordered this dish, that is usually a street food, because grandma is too old to risk eating street food! The fish balls and pig skin were seasoned pretty well and had a decent curry flavor. The radish pieces were much better than the street version. The street food vendors usually cook their radish with other innard items on their menu, so their radish carries the taste of those items. So, the radish at this restaurant didn't have that weird flavor and the natural sweetness of the radish came through much better.Egg, Ginger & Pig's Knuckle in Sweet Vinegar$ 651Egg, Ginger & Pig's Knuckle in Sweet Vinegar$ 65Egg, Ginger & Pig's Knuckle in Sweet Vinegar: The sweet vinegar in this dish was pretty tasty. The eggs were really hard from cooking for so long in the vinegar, which was expected. The Pig's Knuckle wasn't as tender as expected. Overall, the dish is ok.Deep Fried Wonton w/Sweet & Sour Sauce$ 651Deep Fried Wonton w/Sweet & Sour Sauce$ 65Deep Fried Wonton w/Sweet & Sour Sauce1Deep Fried Wonton w/Sweet & Sour SauceDeep Fried Wonton w/Sweet & Sour Sauce: My uncle and I are big fans of this dish, so we always order it when it's on the menu. The version this restaurant serves is the modernized version, so the wontons were more delicate and had the thinner wonton skin. We prefer the old school style with the thick crunchy wonton skin.Deep Fried Wonton w/Sweet & Sour Sauce1Deep Fried Wonton w/Sweet & Sour SauceThe sauce was pretty good with the many different ingredients in it. The sweetness and acidity of the sauce was well-balanced. Deep Fried Wonton w/Sweet & Sour Sauce1Deep Fried Wonton w/Sweet & Sour SauceAfter my aunt's family arrived, we ordered the special Dim Sum set, where you pick 5 dim sums that is served according to the number of people ordering the set, and a vegetable dish is included along with a dumpling soup for each person.1Dumpling in Soup w/Minced Pork & Dried Conpoy1Dumpling in Soup w/Minced Pork & Dried ConpoyDumpling in Soup w/Minced Pork & Dried Conpoy: The soup was quite aromatic, and the dumpling was filled to the brim. However, I prefer the old school version where the soup is within the dumpling, and you have to break the dumpling for the broth to spill out.Cabbage and Bean Curd Sheet with Gingko Nuts1Cabbage and Bean Curd Sheet with Gingko NutsCabbage and Bean Curd Sheet with Gingko Nuts: I have never had cabbage this way, and I found that the bean curd sheets gave a natural sweetness to the cabbage.The dim sum dishes we picked were pretty much on par with other restaurants.Steamed Dumpling w/Turnip, Peanuts & Pork ''Chiu Chow'' style...1Steamed Dumpling w/Turnip, Peanuts & Pork ''Chiu Chow'' style...Steamed Prawn Dumplings1Steamed Prawn DumplingsSteamed Prawn Dumplings: The prawn dumplings were larger than what we are used to, so I can understand why a lot of people recommend them.Chicken Wings w/Ginger Sauce1Chicken Wings w/Ginger SauceSteamed Barbecue Pork Buns1Steamed Barbecue Pork BunsSteamed Barbecue Pork Buns: There was a good amount of delicious filling, and the bun itself was sweet and moist.Steamed Beef Stomach w/Satay Sauce1Steamed Beef Stomach w/Satay Sauce12We ordered theSteamed Rice Flour Roll w/Shrimps from the a la carte dim sum menu since it's a must have item for the family.Steamed Rice Flour Roll w/Shrimps$ 651Steamed Rice Flour Roll w/Shrimps$ 65Steamed Rice Flour Roll w/Shrimps: The rice flour wrapping was not really thin, so it was just ok. The shrimps were pretty large and were not mushy, so that's a plus.Deep Fried Dumpling w/Pork$ 431Deep Fried Dumpling w/Pork$ 43Deep Fried Dumpling w/Pork: This is a personal favorite, so I couldn't resist ordering it after re-reading the menu and saw that the price of the dish is discounted on weekends! The crust of the dumpling was perfectly crispy on the outside and sticky and chewy on the inside!The dim sum set came with dessert, but I was too full to have it already!Heichinrou in Central is a good venue for a relaxing Sunday dim sum lunch. Since the Central office crowd is not around on the weekends, the restaurant is not crowded, and you won't feel rushed during the meal. The service is pretty good, and the servers were quite attentive in changing our plates and refilling the teapots throughout the meal. The weekend dim sum set and discount on the a la carte menu are pretty good deals since dim sum at Heichinrou can be a bit pricey. I would definitely suggest coming to Heichinrou if grandma's favorite dim sum venue is not available again!

Central,Chinese,"Teawood is one of those places that seem like a solid choice when it comes to not being sure what to eat or if I'm with girlfriends who don't want to choose anything they aren't familiar with. As that is what Teawood does well. It offers a nice consistent area for customers, serving various Taiwanese favorites for a reasonable price in a pretty setting.Boyfriend and I were in Central for Art Central and found that they had opened a new Teawood in Central. We had never noticed this branch before, so we gave it a try. It seemed that the design was different than the other branches. Usually they have a very white and beige design, a very Muji type feel. But this one was more luxurious as they opted for dark wood panels and leather seats. I assume they are focusing more on a different type of customer in Central as opposed to their other branches?Menu is in English and Chinese and is like their usual trademark newspaper type format. However, I noticed that they have reservation service here at night. I guess that's pretty good because the queues at Teawood can get pretty insane.0Cuttlefish Roll in Soy Sauce, Sesame Oil and Wine ($72).We shared a starter of marinated cuttlefish. This was placed over a small candle to keep it warm. I liked it. The cuttlefish was tender and not over cooked. The sauce was not too salty and had a lot of big pieces of sliced ginger that made the whole dish smell fantastic.0Fried Chicken Fillet and Marinated Minced Pork with Rice ($80).Boyfriend had this. It seems a lot of the time we eat at Teawood, he orders this. The chicken fillet crispy but still moist and not dry on the inside. It seemed they marinated the skin with a salt and pepper mixture that is popular in a lot of Taiwanese fried food items. The minced pork was sweet and went well with finishing off the rice. It came with a bit of pickled vegetables and half a soysauce marinaded egg.0Handmade Pasta with Cheese and Creamy Boston Lobster ($138).I noticed they served pasta here, something I never noticed in other branches. When it arrived, I was surprised the lobster was bigger than the amount of pasta. It tasted ok. The pasta was cooked al dente. But what I liked was the sauce. It had a strong cheese taste. It was so creamy and rich. A pretty decent cheese sauce that I think would have been better with macaroni for a mac n cheese.0Brown Sugar Bed Bean in Ice Pearl Milk Tea ($38).Boyfriend ordered this as his drink. Drink was fairly sweet from the brown sugar but the tea used was fragrant and rich. The tapioca pearls were soft.0Rose and Roselle Tea ($40).I chose this drink and it came in a pot that you can refill upon request. It smelled lovely but the roselle over powered everything when you tasted it. I think it needed a touch of honey to sweeten it up as I love honey with my tea. But that is not available.0Tiramisu Danish Toast ($90).I remember the first time I had one of these from Teawood. I had ordered it with such joy but then as I continued to eat, I regretted my choice and I left it in a soggy ice cream mess. I guess boyfriend forgot about my dread of eating this as he ordered it without my knowledge. When it arrived, I was all set for the painful regret that will sink in. But for some reason, this didn't happen. Why? Teawood improved on their signature toast. Improved on it significantly. The bread used was toasted so it was still crispy. The bread used was also better as it was buttery Danish bread. Everything tastes better with butter. They also used a better ice cream (that was coffee flavored) as it was smooth and creamy. I recall before the ice cream didn't taste like ice cream but this strange fluffy cream. It is now just one scoop of ice cream so it didn't melt to become one big puddle, making everything soggy. The ice cream to toast proportions is now more balanced. I'm glad they made such a good improvement on this so now when my girlfriends insist on ordering, I can now nod my head instead of begging no.0Teawood is always a solid place that I go to often. A good option for me to choose for my next girlfriend gathering.",TeaWood Taiwanese Cafe & Restaurant,3.6,250,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-teawood-taiwanese-cafe-restaurant/486576?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

Central,Chinese,"My husband and I were looking somewhere quick to eat before my son's playgroup. I suddenly remembered this place so we hurriedly went in around 1:45pm. Luckily the lunch crowd was almost gone because we had a baby, it would've been quite annoying for other diners if it was packed (which I'm sure it is at normal the lunch hour). We ordered the rich lobster bisque udon ($120) and the lobster cheong fun ($68). The udon came really quickly, the ladies were really considerate, giving us extra bowls and placing the hot soup away from my baby. At first glance, there was a substantial amount of lobster on top (awesome), with other garnishes (can't remember what else apart from corn) and a lobster oil (I think). The lobster bisque was thick and creamy, packed with flavour, we (including my son) enjoyed it immensely. I had a bit of the lobster, it was tender and not overcooked, which is easy to do especially when it's in a hot broth. Portion was good, my husband couldn't finish the noodles. The cheong fun came much later. I was wondering what took so long, as I assumed it would just be pre-steamed cheong fun with a lobster sauce on it. It came with bits of lobster (not the big chunks like in the udon but it's only $68! what did you expect?) and shrimp/lobster roe. They even had roe on the table so you can help yourself to more. I like the generousity, even though I didn't add any. I took a bite and I realised why it took so long. The cheong fun wasn't just steamed, they were lightly fried so they had a slight crispiness to it. Very enjoyable, I ate it all as my husband wasn't interested. If I were to be picky then I'd say it was a little bit oily and heavy together with the sauce, so it would be good to add something to cut through the richness.At a time where dining out is crazy expensive, I think Lobster Bobo's food is worth its value. Service was good, even though there wasn't a service charge. I mean a $120 for a soup noodle lunch isn't cheap by any means but this is lobster! In Central!

Central,Chinese,"BBQ meats were surprisingly decent. the BBQ pork had nice charred bits and a good balance of sweetness and soy sauce saltiness. However, the other dishes were generally subpar in terms of flavor and/or skill. Stir-fried sticky rice was OK but quite soggy, not the characteristics one would expect if it was ""raw fried"" as claimed (meaning that the grains of rice were cooked from start to finish in the wok by stir frying resulting in the more coveted al dente finish rather than a soggy sticky mess that sticky rice is prone to). The last dish, and the one that drove the nail to the coffin of a bad review was the vermecelli dish. At $90, it featured fish and gai lan and was supposed to be stewed. We didn't expect much, perhaps a bit of fish filets tossed in some consomm and a couple gai lan stalks (the normal way to do any type of ""stewed"" noodle dish), but what we got was some pale looking noodles that was merely tossed in oil with some pieces of minced fish paste and a couple pieces of sad looking gai lan.

Central,Chinese,"dimsum was mediocre. and this is what what other people were raving about. it was bland. tasteless.for example, we had the chicken pie - the crust was hard and too sweet.we tried the abalone - it was expensive, nothing more.the spring roll had black truffle - yes you could smell but not taste.pork dumpling - too gooeywe also tried the fried rice with egg, crab meat and black truffle. there was hardly any taste.the fried pork belly with garlic - you would think it was full of flavor due to the garlic, but total opposite.the service was excellent though. for the small place there seemed to be too many people walking around but you never have to wait to call someone's attention.why this has 2 michelin stars I cannot explain. I don't think those guys at michelin have gone around HK enough to find the really good, authentic places.if it's cantonese and/or dimsum you want, there are literally dozens of other places with better food. perhaps not the ambience. but for this price, is that what you really want to spend your money on?",Duddell's,2.3,500,nan,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-duddells/137716?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
Central,Chinese,"My colleague hyped about the slow-cooked Chinese BBQ pork of this shop so I came to check it out. The shop branded itself as a not-your-average Chinese BBQ restaurant by:1) its tiffany-blue color theme, almost like a froyo shop;2) its use of uncoventional method of slow-cooking its BBQ pork (supposedly more tender and juicy than the traditional kind); and 3) offering a few trendy/creative side dishes which would never set foot in a traditional Chinese BBQ place, such as hot spring egg (with wobbly egg white and egg yolk), eggplant with fish sauce, homemade kimchi and fried okra.I ordered slow-cooked BBQ pork and chicken with rice. The slow-cooked BBQ pork was on par with the good ones in Central, such as Lung Kee and Yat Lok. Its scallion oil had no taste to it whatsoever. While the food was decent, I would not revisit the shop for the following its pitiful portions and un-generosity:1) Pitiful portions: While the side dishes looked good, Good BBQ asked for HK$15 for two bite-sized side dishes. Literally, two bites - think of the wasabi or small kimchi plastic containers when you order takeouts. While the prices were considered reasonable in Central, a grown man would not be satisfied with the quantity the shop offered; and2) All the surcharges: Extra scallion oil in a half-full 5ml costs an extra HK$1 (just like McDonald if you want an extra dip for six-piece McNugget). An extra HK$2 just to pick a fattier or leaner portion of BBQ pork. While some shops, e.g. Lung Kee, do charge extra for scallion oil if the order doesn't contain chicken, the BBQ pork surcharge is simply unheard of. This place seems to seize every opportunity to charge extra the way its peer shops won't. In conclusion, food was on par with other good BBQ restaurants in Central. The portion's reasonable for office ladies but not the lads. Side dishes, as tempting as they look, came in abhorrent portions for what you pay for. I didn't feel good looking at all the possible surcharges. It certainly didn't make me want to go back again.",Good BBQ,2.8,42,10,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-good-bbq/472287?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

There is usually a long wait for weekday lunch, but otherwise you should be able to walk straight in. The decor and service are both no frills, but perfectly acceptable for this type of place. The Cafe itself is also clean as far as I can see, but the drains outside the door can be a bit smelly. Don't let that put you off!I have always had the same thing, the barbecue pork tea set. I love this set at most places, but particularly at Swiss Cafe. They are much more generous with the meat than anywhere else I have been, and the portion sizes more generally are really big. The macaroni soup has a strong flavour which I prefer. I do thing the set would be better with scrambled eggs, but the fried eggs are very tasty and halfway to scrambled anyway, which is nice.The main reason I recommend this place is the price. $40 for a big meal + drink in the middle of Central is amazing.

Hoisin sauce on baguette topped with roast duck. A twist from Peking duck pancake I guess. Bread was soggy by the time it arrived at table... Awful. Duck terrine ... Even worst. Duck pieces all fallen apart. It looked well marinated but it was dull and tasteless. Hugely disappointed. I had to ask the waiter why is it so tasteless. They didn't explain and offered to take it back. I then ordered a macaroni and cheese (from kids menu)to be safe. It was fine. All meals range around $150. A smoothie was $60. Without looking for the drinks menu I ordered apple juice x 2. These turned out to be the most expensive juice ever. $42 each!!! And they are not the fresh ones.Again I asked if there was a mistake..

Central,Chinese,"This was the last part in my quest to try the three Michelin listed (not rated, just listed) dumpling restaurants in Hong Kong (the other two are nearby Dumpling Yuan and Ah Chun Shangdong Dumpling in Price Edward (which in my view is the best of the three)).The specialty of this simple restaurant are Beijing style dumplings. So we tried Pork and Chinese Cabbage Dumplings  10 pieces for 48 HKD. And we got 10 nice, decently sized, good tasting and obviously homemade dumplings. Nothing to complain about, dumplings as they are supposed to be.In addition we ordered Gou Bu Li  4 pieces for 32 HKD, which is a kind of stuffed baozi. As I never had the original ones from Tianjin I don't have a reference point, these where relatively flat and had a minced meat filling. Given that it is impossible to get decent baozi in Hong Kong I would say these where ok, but definitely not as good as any street stall in Beijing or Shanghai as casing and filling where quite dry.Hot and sour soup (little bowl for 20 HKD) was neither very hot nor very sour, so there are definitely better versions available in HK.So overall: good dumplings (I would say it's a draw with Dumpling Yuan), not very excited about the other dishes. Would come back anytime for a quick snack, but probably stick to the dumplings.Service was ok, dishes came very fast.Prices are listed above, as you would expect from a place like this it provides some very reasonably priced food.",Wang Fu,nan,100,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-wang-fu/15794?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

This is a private kitchen and completely home-run, with paintings a little kid drew hung around the walls of the apartment-like restaurant. Although the place is severely underfurnished, the tables are in fact less cluttered together than many other places in Central. When we came at exactly 12, we were the first few customers and were directed to a table with adequate space and privacy.The lunch menu is very simplethere is a range of Sichuan noodles from Dandan noodles to Zha Jiang (Fried Sauce) noodles () to Hot and Sour Sweet Potato Noodles (). These are all around $30-$50. We ordered one Dandan noodles for share and also had Sichuan Chicken (), Spicy Beef () and non-spicy stir-fried lettuce ().The food came in less than two minutes. The Dandan noodles look a bit different from usualneither the Japanese nor the Sichuanese variety. The soup is a clear (but slightly black) broth and the noodles are slightly grayish in color. The portion is big. The clear soup broth makes this a less heavy dish, as there is no sesame paste or peanut butter. Although there is no shredded pork topping, the soup is well seasoned and I almost had all of it. You will have to finish the noodles quickly if you dont want it to go soggy. This was a tasty dish, though I am not sure this should be called Dandan noodles at all!The Sichuan chicken comes as a cold dish and the chicken is cut into pieces. The meat is super tender and I loved this because I didnt have to pick out the bones. It also has a very special spicy sauce topping that is black in colora truly intense and memorable flavor. The portion size is very generous. This is just $30. No chili oil or peanut.The spicy beef also came as a cold dish. These are slices of lean beef boiled in fermented chili bean paste and soy saucethe Sichuan peppercorns leave your tongue with a lingering numbing sensation. This wasnt greasy and the beef slices were mostly tender, although I was unable to chew on some of them.The vegetables were crispy and juicy and helped soothe our burning tongues.Service was great.

Central,Chinese,"As the headline suggests I went for dim sum on a Sunday.The restaurant has a slightly odd basement location. The interior is modern, but not fancy, let's say it doesn't distract from the food. Is a realatiy small restaurant (by Chinese standards), probably a bit under 20 tables.We ordered to types of char siu based dim sum. The baked one had a thin shell and lots of stuffing, which was quite sweet - together with the sugar on the bun a bit too sweet for my taste. Not bad, but no match for Tim Ho Wan's signature. The steamedchar siu bao was solid HK quality.The ha gow (shrimp dumplings) where at the higher end of the HK quality range - relatively large and with perfect texture.The sui mai where the least good of the lot with the shrimp overlooked and the overall flavor too mild.Finally we got the boss' signature fried rice, which was truly one of the best fried rice I ever had (and I had a lot in my life) - very dark and savory with lots of shrimp and a bit of green vegetables.As desert I picked one of my usual favorites - mango, sago, pomelo. A relatively disappointing version - too creamy and very liquid.Overall a good experience, but I don't understand why this restaurant deserves I Michelin star compared to many other equally good restaurants.

Central,Chinese,"Came here with eight other colleagues on a Friday for lunch. I was one of the three late-joiners so by the time I had arrived the orders have already been put through.The dishes were: tofu and cucumber as appetizers, Shanghai-style soy-sauce cooked duck, deep-fried small yellow fish, stir-fried beansprouts with bamboo, Shanghai-style pork dumplings, shredded pork with Chinese buns, and rice cake. Finally, we had osmanthus jelly pudding and deep-fried red bean paste and banana pancake for dessert.For a nine-people lunch, the selection was a good balance. Having a very sensitive bowel I have to stay on a FODMAP diet 95% of the time and it gives me a lot of trouble enjoying meals with people who don't know about my dietary requirements well enough. But here I could still eat almost everything, even if not in large quantities.For the price (which was only around $200 per person), I really cannot complain about the quality of the food, especially given that the restaurant was very spacious. It's difficult to find a place in Central where you can sit and talk in privacy and comfort.Often times my take-aways are above $200 and I would get much less quality. None of the dishes were particularly memorable, but for a restaurant chain I was happy with what they served. Nothing was completely off even though the way they made their dishes was not too authentic to the Shanghainese tradition.So back to the food--The tofu was of good quality, but the sauce overpowered the freshness of the tofu. Still tasted refreshing though if you avoid the sauce (which I had to). Something I would recommend for appetizer for a meal with over say six people. Cucumber was even better. Restaurants often source some of the lowest quality raw materials but Shanghai Min seems to be more than decent in that aspect. The cucumbers were freshly cut and still retained their cucumber juices and the seasoning went in perfect harmony with them. Definitely a highlight even if it was just an appetizer. Soy-sauce cooked duck was very nice. But it depends on whether you like your sauces sweet, as Shanghai dishes often inevitably do have a lot of sugar in them. Texture-wise the flesh was also very nice--not too soft nor too flakey--an indication that the duck is neither unfresh nor overcooked.Pork dumplings were OK. The skin was well-made. For this price, I was very impressed. The deep-fried fish was excellent also, as everyone agreed, but as I couldn't eat too much as it was deep-fried. Stir-fried beansprouts were good, but I would add a little less oil. Their chefs might not be extraordinary, but the raw materials they source are of better than average quality for restaurants in general. I didn't try the rice cakes as it was not something I would be able to digest. Shredded pork was a great disappointment. Too salty, too hard and too oily. But perhaps it wouldn't matter if, like the others, I spooned the pork into the buns (which I could not eat as it contained flour).I didn't have the dessert save for a small bite of the red bean paste, but the jelly seemed to be unimpressive based on other people's comments, while the pancake was quite alright.Overall an enjoyable meal where I got to eat a little bit of many things. I would definitely recommend the place to anyone looking to book for a large group of friends or colleagues in busy Central. And could I also add that they didn't have air conditioning blasting at 10 degrees? The temperature was very comfortable. Service was very, very average though, but I might give them a second chance.",Shanghai Min,3.2,200,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-shanghai-min/9835?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
Central,Chinese,"We had just flown in from Maldives on a red eye flight and even though our hotel had graciously allowed us an early check in, it didn't quite help mitigate our lack of sleep. And so there we were, tired but hungry, having lunch at our favourite dim sum restaurant, Lung King Heen, on a chilly weekday afternoon (we had left Maldives with a scorching tan so a cold climate was certainly welcome!).0We managed to snag a much coveted window seat by virtue of making a reservation as soon as it opened up 6 months prior. Not much of a view I must say, especially with the fog and construction going on in the vicinity. But it beats staring into the restaurant or at the other tables.Lobster Dumpling - A singular slice of scallop sandwiched between between a prawn and generous lobster paste, deftly wrapped in a translucently thin yet elastic green skin. Sweet crustacean goodness in one full bite.1Abalone Puff - One whole abalone (albeit small but complete with shimmering gravy) sitting on a bed of savoury minced chicken, complete with a wonderfully buttery pastry shell that didn't threaten to crumble at the touch of my fork. Wah Lok's rendition comes close but isn't quite like the real deal (maybe its the whole abalone vs diced abalone issue).0BBQ Pork Bun - I once mentioned that LKH's BBQ pork buns () are even better than that of Tim Ho Wan's and I firmly stick by my judgement. Pillowy soft with a crusty, sweet top. Filled with a joyous concoction of gooey, mildly sweet BBQ pork and pine nuts, with the latter providing a subtle crunch and a hint of buttery nuttiness. (It was so delicious that even Piggy Guy couldn't resist jumping in on the action)Lung King Heen Roast Chicken - The eponymous chicken dish that had us salivating for more in two of our previous visits still boasted crackling crisp skin coupled with moist, juicy meat that carried a salty slant. However, the chicken did seem a wee bit on the fatty side this time round (or maybe as I grow older I tend to be more health conscious?) and I had to resort to removing the yellow bits of fat beneath the skin before consumption. Still a very good eat nonetheless and thumbs up to the crisp lotus root chips served alongside as well.Fried Rice with Roasted Goose, Barbecued Pork, Shrimp, Taro and Preserved Vegetables - We would usually go with the namesake lobster fried rice but decided to try something different this time round. And we settled for this ""all in one"" pot of fried rice after spotting a recommended sign on the menu. Well fried with a mild wok hei and evenly coated in black sauce, the rice boasted a bevy of ingredients (roasted goose, BBQ pork, shrimp, taro and preserved vegetables) and tasted like a more refined and flavourful version of the humble yam rice that is sometimes available at braised duck stalls in Singapore. Bits of taro imbued a slightly mushy texture whilst the preserved vegetables offered a salty side. Bite sized chunks of BBQ pork and roasted goose provided the necessary protein. Pretty good but only if you do not dislike yam.Petit Fours - And ending off with their ""signature"" petit fours; wolfberry (aka goji berry) jelly and a rice cracker, both of which we had on my very first visit.Lunch was a comparatively cheaper affair than our previous visit, just shy of 1000 HKD (~ SGD 175). And it was enjoyable, even though the whole jet lag thing did mar the experience a little; we were constantly yawning and staring into space.

The restaurant is small, and crowded, not recommended to come if you want a nice long lunch, however, if you are eating alone and don't mind sharing tables with people practically sitting on your lap, this is a cheap and easy place to go.The staff is efficient and fast. You should know exactly what you want because they will not have the patience to recommend or go through the menu with you. If you dine in, expect your food to come quickly (a huge plus!) but also expect to be rushed out as soon as you finish. The wait staff will openly tell you to leave and pay the bill. You can also see there's a long queue outside that's always at least 10 -15 people deep.The restaurants specialty is noodle soup with your choice of 1-3 toppings. I always get the pork and veg dumpling with fresh fish meat balls. The portions are HUGE. Theres a choice of rice vermicelli, rice noodles and thick or thin egg noodles. The dumplings are all freshly made. When you bite into the dumpling you can feel some of the meat juices oozing out. The dumpling skin is soft and silky. The fresh fish meat balls is also their specialty. When you bite into the ball you can feel there is fresh fish meat, whereas some places mix a lot of flour into the mixture. if you're feeling more adventurous you can dry the intestines or kidney with the noodles.

Central,Chinese,"There's just no getting around it, sometimes you need to 'bite the bullet' and book a restaurant. I love taking my chances and rocking up to a restaurant and seeing if I can jag a table. It works more often that you'd think, but I guess when you are trying to get into one of Hong Kong's hottest new Michelin Starred restaurants, making a reservation is a much smarter option. It didn't stop me from trying to get into The Boss, located in Queens Road Central, a few times before giving up and making a booking.To be honest, I only made a reservation this time because I was hosting a work colleague who was visiting from London, so it wouldn't do to turn up for a busy lunch service, only to be turned away. It seems as if my reputation for choosing for amazing restaurants had spread, so I'd been given specific instructions not to book into an 'expensive' restaurant. Knowing that The Boss had a lunchtime Dim Sum menu seemed to be the logical choice, it would showcase a great new restaurant to our London visitor, while keeping it real for our wallets...The Boss is located in the basement of the Peter Building in QRC and once you descend the steps the the dining room, you're presented with a modern looking take on a Chinese restaurant. Modern and minimalist are the words that spring to mind when describing the fit out of the restaurant, combining blacks and greys for a sleek and contemporary feel.0We were handed a number of menus, including the lunchtime set, which consisted of three very reasonably priced banquets style options. We were also provided the a la carte menu, which for the lunchtime hours consists of an extensive dim sum selection. My lunch companions handed the menu to me and with the assumption that I'd pick some delicious Cantonese, let me sort out lunch. Knowing that the kitchen was being managed by Chane des Rtisseurs medal winner and thirty year veteran, Executive Chef Tony Lam, I knew that just about anything I selected would be superb.But I kept that piece of knowledge to myself  .I loved the unique presentation of the deep fried spring rolls with shrimp and garlic, instead of coming flat on a plate like every other restaurant, the spring rolls came standing upright in a glass. The crisp golden rolls stood around and tall in a glass, which made them much easier to get access to and dip into the chilli sauce. The golden coating was very light, with none of that greasy feel that sometimes affects spring rolls. The prawn filling was wonderfully cooked and the ever so gentle flavour of garlic was appreciated. I'd have loved a few more!0Shrimp dumplings are an absolute requirement for me when eating dim sum and the Boss shrimp dumplings were as good as they come. The translucent dumplings allowed us to see the fresh prawns so clearly and the sticky dumpling skin stuck to our chops sticks as we dipped them into some vinegar. Luckily for me, there were four dumplings, and with only three of us at the table, I managed to score the extra serve!0There was a bit of a trade off however - I'd ordered the steamed barbecue pork buns and, not being a fan, I offered my pork bun to the table. Interestingly MR, who also mentioned he didn't usually like pork buns, thought they were great. It's possible I missed out on a new experience by not trying the Boss version, so I might just need to go back some time.0Another very traditional dim sum offering was the steamed spicy prawn and pork dumpling, which is essentially a pork wrapped prawn, steamed to perfection. There is something about the combination of prawn and pork that really works, and again, I found the Michelin Starred Boss version to be every bit as good as the Tim Ho Wan version (the cheapest Michelin Starred restaurant around).0When eating dim sum and dumplings, there is always one special little morsel that I keep my eye out for, xiaolongbao. Called steamed Shanghai dumplings on the menu, I spent some time explaining the concept of soup filled dumplings to our London based dining companion. The idea is to bite the corner of the dumpling, then drink the flavoursome soup before devouring the rest of the dumpling. I've perfected a technique where I can just pop the whole xiaolongbao into my mouth without burning my tongue, with the combined flavour of the pork and broth taking me to heaven. The Boss version was not quite as refined as Din Tai Fung, but they were delicious none-the-less.0It wasn't all sunshine and smiles though. wW'd ordered the steamed beef balls, which I didn't really care for and the steamed flour rolls with barbecued pork, which were just OK. I think it was the texture of the steamed beef balls that didn't sit well on my palate, although to be fair, my dining companions thought each was pretty delicious.00It was interesting to get the perspective of my dining companions, who were both as impressed as I was about our The Boss meal. I'd certainly met the expectations of finding a restaurant that was both high quality and reasonably priced. Of course, The Boss meal we'd consumed was from the cheaper dim sum selection and a full meal would be significantly more expensive - as you'd expect from a Michelin Starred dining spot.Service was excellent and not at all reflective of the grief I'd experienced the half dozen times I'd tried to do a walk in for lunch. Clearly, if you've made a reservation, you're all good and you're going to be well looked after. Make the mistake of thinking you can just walk in, well, that's a little bit of a different proposition. Our dim sum was delivered at just the right pace to ensure we felt sated, but not overly full.There are a lot of nice restaurants in Hong Kong, many with Michelin Stars, but I found The Boss to be the perfect spot for a quick lunchtime meal on the cheap (relatively). It was good enough to want me to take the girl along for lunch or dinner sometime soon, and a restaurant where I want a quick revisit, is a spot worth talking about...0The mystery dumplings - I can't remember what they were called, but they were tasty!0The spring rolls presented in a unique and interesting manner0The steamed prawn dumplings were my favourite The Boss dumplings0And the magic Michelin Star for The Boss - new entrant for 20150Supplementary InformationMake a booking and check out the lunchtime dim sum",The Boss,nan,400,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-the-boss/135392?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
Central,Chinese,"This is a new restaurant in the Maxim's Group that has replaced one of our go-to restaurants in the Landmark, the Kiku.

It is no longer a top end restaurant like Kiku was but a Szechuan-meet-Japan quick-eat-casually place.We ordered quite a few dishes for the two of us: Dumplings in red oil - spicy and piquant as expected. Tastes quite good, especially considering the fact that it is not a full-fledged Szechuan restaurant but the dough wrapping can be thinner still. Pomelo salad - as stated on the menu, there is a spicy dressing, more like Thai (reminds me of Lian, another restaurant in the Maxims chain that closed quite a few years back). This dish is more invented / modified from a Thai flavour, it seems, than it is Chinese or Japanese. Very pleasant and refreshing. I will definitely order this when I return.Sushi platter - this was presented on a stand and has 12 pieces (I think). Fresh and tasty.Soft shell crab in rich paper roll - again, something like a Vietnamese variant. The crab was larger than the tiny ones often found in other outlets and crunchy.

Then again, I am not a big fan. Even though it helps avoid a really thick and rubbery piece of pork, some people enjoy the satisfaction of chewing through a thick, JUICY piece of pork chop. The thin slithers of pork did not achieve the same effect. The batter was very well made and the skin was very crisp and moreish, but I think I prefer a pork chop. Don't get me wrong though - this dish is worth a try. Caution to those who can't take heat: the dandanmien (noodles) are pretty spicy!! The noodles came with a small dollop of peanut, onion and shallot mince, which, when mixed in well with the noodles, tasted pretty darn delish. Just a mouthful for me because I can't really eat spicy food.The dandan noodles were cooked al dente (yep I'm using this term to describe Chinese noodles), slightly chewier than expected, but it was fine! Thoroughly enjoyable - if only it were a tad less spicy. Maybe you could make the specific request when you order, the resto probably could accommodate!Conclusion:Although my overall rating of the food this time is a mere ""OK"", I will definitely be back! coz the takeaway hot lunch boxes look delicous.

Central,Chinese,"0It's easy to get carried away eating dumplings in Hong Kong, most Chinese restaurants seem to do dim sum during the busy lunch period. My dumplings place of choice is Din Tai Fung, but there is not a Din Tai Fung close to work, so I've had to look for other places to dine. You'd think that would be easy with so many restaurants, right? Well, I'm finding it pretty difficult, mainly because most of the restaurants are not on street level, but on various floors in high rise buildings, so it's a bit hit and miss.I've managed to find one restaurant nearby that is clearly marked from street level and is relatively easy to access... I mean, you just have to go up a couple of floors in a rickety old elevator and guess at the right level because I can't quite read Chinese yet!The Majesty Seafood Restaurant takes up the whole of level two (or three) and has pretty awesome views of Queens Road Central for a brief respite during lunch from the crazy crowds that make up Central HK. On my first visit, I was placed right by the window and had a great view of the crush of crowds below.0 There were no menus for lunch at the Majesty, it's a matter of pulling out a slip of paper that has all of the menu items, thankfully in English as well. However, with no real sections that I could discern (again, suffering from not reading Chinese), I had to have a guess at what I was ordering and hoping that I'd receive the dumplings I was very much craving for. The sweet smell of success..... I'd guessed right and the very dumplings I'd been hoping for started to arrive at my table. In what had turned out to be a case of eyes bigger than belly, I'd ordered too many dumplings, twelve in all. My favourite was easily the big prawn dumplings encased a glutinous dough that allowed the large prawn pieces to shine through. In fact, they looked so inviting, I ignored the warning bells in my head and jumped straight in, while they were still steaming hot. Yeah, that was a big mistake. Not wanting to spit the dumpling out, I held it in my mouth, trying to cool it down, but in the process just burned the inside of my mouth! Another lesson learned in HK - wait until food stops steaming.0 0Mouth burning aside, I really enjoyed all of the dumplings from the Majesty Seafood Restaurant and have been back a few time for lunch.

Though the main standouts other than the buns included the ""tonic medlar and petal cake"" which is definitely a classic dish often differently described. I believe it is made with chrysanthemum tea and petals but I'm really not sure. In the end it is a delicious, slightly sweet, textural jelly that is the perfect cleanser. The other standout was the glutinous rice or lo mai gai. This classic dish, wrapped in lotus leaves, contains chicken, Chinese sausage (tastes like blood sausage here), mushrooms and several other base ingredients. The perfume from the steamed lotus leaf provides an attractive introduction to what is a dense, decadent, and rich package of rice and meat.

(ex:Chicken, Duck, Pork etc...)I had gone to many of roasted meat shop, and I had eaten much of roasted meat when I had visited Hong kong.Among of all shops, I recommend this shop is the best shop of roasted meat.Pork B.B.Q()is very tender and quality is genuine.And I have to tell one thing, attached rice is good.I guess almost roasted meat shops thinks that attached rice is not so important.But this shops are using good rice, and not added oriental style spice.It's easy to eat, and also meat are fantastic.I recommend roasted duck and Cantonese Pork B.B.Q with rice.(Perhaps It is called ())Roasted duck and boiled chicken with rice.()...0Roasted duck and boiled chicken with rice.()...(This picture was Duck and Chicken, It's not B.B.Q)Duck are including bone, but it's very tender and good taste like a Beijing duck.",Dau Ji Roast Expert,4.1,60,5,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-dau-ji-roast-expert/86485?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
Central,Chinese,"Go down the unassuming escalator and you'll discover yourself in a glittery world of cool decor, boudoir-cum-dungeon style eatery, where soft thumping club music is playing in the background, every waiting staff is under 30 years of age (or at least look it), and people dine without reading the price list on the menu. They might as well not have printed it, because the price alone might give someone a heart attack. $320 for a dish of char siu? $110 for ONE har gao? I didn't even dare ask how much the Peking duck cost. Thankfully I was a guest.... and I took no chances at not savouring all those lovely dishes I've been oogling on this website.First up, the char siu. Tender, juicy, just the perfect amount of fat where you can taste it, but you can't see it, and it's so well marbled into the meat that you think you're just eating lean meat that's awefully succulent. And I love that it's not smothered in sugary honey sauce, sometimes it gets so gooey that you can see it being pulled like spun sugar. So good, and so few pieces to go around a table of eight. Oh, and go for the deluxe/supreme version.Deluxe char siu0Deluxe char siuThen it's the roast pork belly. Crispy crackling, melt-in-the-mouth meat, perfectly seasoned. Bite-size delights.And then some. The fatty, creamy, wobbly stewed lard-on-flesh was flanked by a few verdant crunchy broccoli and topped with crispy sliver-thin slices of radish? (whatever it was, it was brushed aside pretty quickly), and the tower fell apart at the slightest prod of a fork, it was THAT good. The skin was cooked so that the texture was almost collagenous and didn't taste greasy at all. The meat put me in a stupour. So yum.Hualian slow cooked pork belly0Hualian slow cooked pork bellyThen the Peking duck which I had requested the day before. Despite the duck being decently sized, there was surprisingly fewer slices of skin or meat that I had expected. I could have taken the carcass home and done some serious damage to it with my fingers. The wafer-thin wraps came in a steam basket and was individually layered with paper so they won't stick. The condiments were lovely, especially the sweet, dark sauce that replaced the regular hoisin sauce in other restaurants, it was almost like a sweet aged balsamic vinegar. Needless to say, everyone dived in before I could whip out my phone for a shot.Peking duck - meat, skin, both0Peking duck - meat, skin, bothThere were also dim sums such as wagyu beef puff, prawn/crab roe/pork siu mai, har gau, a clay pot of cod with potato and chilli, and a dish of stir fried string beans. All very nice, some using expensive ingredients, but for me dim sum should make a good honest meal without having to sell your kidney. But admittedly, it was all well executed.

Central,Chinese,"I'm a frequent Yummy Noodles customer at lunch time (not to confuse with the one 2 stores away with the same name but without the word 'Noodle' at the end), the food is consistently good - I might be biased here as I always have the same food.I was reluctant to try this place before just because it isn't a traditional (historical) noodle shop you can find elsewhere in Central. After my first visit, it has definitely changed my naive mindset and become a regular customer.Recommended Food: Signature Beef Brisket Noodle - can be served in either soup or as lo mein (stirred noodle)It is one of the best beef brisket I had, not only it's soft in texture, it has also brought out the original taste from the beef well. Thin egg noodle cooked really well too and most importantly -it's 'al dente'. If you are hungry, lo mein is probably a better choice as the portion is huge with an extra $6. Otherwise, noodle in soup with additional veggie should have satisfied most office workers appetite.I am not sure what other food's like. But my food buddies were also impressed with the food there except for the rice noodle. It's overcooked and not as good as other rice noodle specialist nearby.Supplementary InformationThey have a special price for drinks and veggie if you order with noodles. Extra $6 for drinks ($3 supplement for special cold drinks) and $12 for drinks and veggie",Yummy Noodle,4.6,50,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-yummy-noodle/112444?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw
Central,Chinese,"We had made a good choice to have dine in this local spot during our quick HK trip. Reached before noon for lunch on a weekday, so it was easy to get a shared seat before the rest of the working crowd came in. No wait time required but prepared to squeeze into a tiny table with strangers. They have simple menu with pictures (just a few of their best sellers) and much more variety in the chinese menus. We're not able to read chinese (we're tourist after all ) but no hassle with pointing on the pictures and getting food. The only problem was the bundle, or I should say 'set' that comes with the main seems a little complicated (note: for lunch they would pair specific drink with main and the price is cheaper that way than ordering separately). I pointed what I want andkinda irritated the waiter because I didn't choose something within the set. I'm cool with the down service since it was expected level for the 'dai pai dong' environment.We admired the old style HK restaurant during our quick wait and singer Alan Tam's picture all over the wall. Food came and it was instant noodle. Very yummy and addictive with fried marinated soy chicken and vegetables, stirred with sesame oil. Noodle is good and bouncy but chicken was okay - homemade taste and not hot.Then the drinks was on the spot. Excellent milk tea as raved by reviewers. Just the right temperature, texture and sweetness. And then the toast - fried to perfection, served hot. The best toast I've ever has thus far *still drooling*We're seated, lunched and gone within 15 minutes - satisfied. The 'cafe' was easy access from Central and worth a go if you're in that area.chicken one 'ding'1chicken one 'ding'milk tea0milk teafrench toast - Excellent!0french toast - Excellent!",Lan Fong Yuen,nan,50,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-lan-fong-yuen/1814?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
Central,Chinese,"Note that it's a small establishment, so be prepared to share tables with strangers!Loved the fact that each bowl only cost $25 upwardsU have 3 toppings to choose from:- King Prawn Wantan - big, juicy prawn wantans. Yum!- Fresh minced fish ball - huge fish ball... but only so-so- Fresh sliced beef - thinly sliced but also only so-so$25 - 1 topping, $31 - 2 toppings, $35 - 3 toppings.And a choice of 3 noodles - yellow noodle, flat white noodle(kuey teow) or vermicelli (beehoon)Personally, I'd suggest going for just the king prawn wantans w yellow noodle and soybean milk.Fish balls and sliced beef were very meh.Overall I liked their wantan noodles. Had it w 3 toppings, just to try.Loved the huge wantans. Noodles were nice and springy but the broth was just ok.I feel like I've had better wantan noodles in Malaysia tho...",Tsim Chai Kee Noodle,3.7,35,5,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-tsim-chai-kee-noodle/3823?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw
