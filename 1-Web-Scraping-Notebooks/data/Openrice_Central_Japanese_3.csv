Central,Japanese,"A couple of years ago, I went on a solo shopping extravaganza in Tokyo. Exhausted, hungry and carry a ton of shopping bags, I came across a place called The Tomatoman in Ometsando. Tomato soup based tsukemen using organic tomatoes. I loved the richness of the soup. The springiness of the noodles.But apparently, the shop had closed and now has moved to Hong Kong. Located on Gough Street (where there are already two other very outstanding ramen shops), I decided to give this one a try.Though the logo is the same, the whole layout is different. Gone is the white,red and silver design. The Hong Kong branch is red with brown wood.0Menu is similar with the addition of cold noodles and sides. The one in Tokyo was much simpler. Menu is in English, Japanese and Chinese. You can choose how spicy you want your noodles and amount. Unlike most tsukemen places, this one doesn't offer a lighter dashi soup to dilute the soup for you to drink. Instead they suggest you add money for rice to mix it up. This was not offered in the original Tokyo location. But the soup isn't that concentrated so you can actually just drink it as is.0Boyfriend ordered the tsukemen with char siu ($118). He ordered a level 3 spicy and medium amount (250g) of noodles. The char siu lacked flavor. The egg also was a bit bland. The amount of spicy was just right for him but it covered the flavor of the tomato soup.0I had the one without char siu ($88) so I could get slice from him. I had the level 1 spicy (though I recall in Japan I could get baby spicy but this was not available here) and medium amount of noodles as well. The soup was a bit better without the amount of spiciness. It was a bit spicy but not too much. It just didn't cover up the taste of tomato. The only thing was the taste of the tomato also wasn't very rich. The noodles were ok though they were also warm and not cold like how it was in Tokyo. I assume it's to cater to the Hong Kong palate as most do like their dipping noodles warm and not cold. The egg was ok. Not much flavor but at least the yolk was runny.0It was ok but a bit average. Nothing really stood out. Flavor wasn't as intense as the original one in Tokyo. I know to never compare to Japan because they are just so much better over there, but this was far cry from the original. Doubt I'd be back. And a lot more expensive as well.",The Tomatoman,nan,115,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-the-tomatoman/646721?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
Central,Japanese,"Went out to have lunch with colleagues on a Happy Friday. Picked this restaurant as my colleagues wished to have Taiwanese food.0I chose this , as I missed the time I had unagi in Tokyo. To begin with, the whole piece of eel is grilled to an optimal juiciness and scent. You can smell a bit of charred taste, but the meat of the fish is still tender and moist. The sesame, seaweed on top also add some umami and crunchiness to the eel as well. The soft-boiled egg was a nice touch too, which adds some molten yolk to the rice. However, the rice is rather on the soft and mushy side0Sorry to say but the soup was mediocre, didn't expect much from it, but I suggest them to add more flavour to the soup. Will come back for the rice though.",,3.5,140,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-%E4%B8%80%E8%B5%B7%E9%A3%9F%E5%A0%82/603439?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw
Central,Japanese,"Tomato Soup Dipping Noodles with Boiled Pork Meat$ 1180Tomato Soup Dipping Noodles with Boiled Pork Meat$ 118The Tomatoman is a newbie on Gough Street, Central. It serves ramen and tsukemen in tomato broth. It seems that tomato broth is becoming a trend now.Tomato Soup Dipping Noodles with Boiled Pork Meat$ 1180Tomato Soup Dipping Noodles with Boiled Pork Meat$ 118I ordered this Tomato Soup Dipping Noodles with Boiled Pork Meat for lunch and was so satisfied. You could choose how much noodles you want, regular (250g), large (350g) or extra large (450g) for the same price. As for the broth, you could opt for little spicy, which is the least spicy option as the chef put some pepper in making the tomato broth, all the way up to fire spicy (this requires HKD$10 extra, and I wonder how spicy that is!).I got a regular (250g) tsukemen with little spicy broth. The noodles were prepared cold, and the waiter suggested dipping the noodles bit by bit in the broth, otherwise the broth would be cooled really quickly. The noodles were quite thick and chewy. The only thing that I didnt like about the noodles was that they were too coldeven after dipping them in the brothThe broth was very tasty! I particularly like the bits and pieces of okra and broccoli in it. Heavy tomato flavor, yet not artificial.There were 4 piece of pork! How generous is that! And they were really delicious meat indeed.",The Tomatoman,nan,118,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-the-tomatoman/646721?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
Central,Japanese,"I had lunch with my colleague at this restaurant for the first time.  Though I did mark my request for a table next to window side when making the reservation via openrice, the staff didnt offer us a window side table and I also noticed that the window side had been fully occupied at the time of our arrival.  We were seated at the chefs counter in the end.  When we were halfway through our meal, there was an incident where a waitress dropped the plates with food on the floor, which also unfortunately spilled some food on my shoes.  Besides cleaning up the mess in a quick manner, the other staff immediately offered us another table and provided me some napkins to clean off my shoes.  One thing that impressed me so much is a male staff who looked like the owner or manager of this restaurant shortly came over to apologize and give us our meal free.  I had never come across with such superb service at any restaurant in Hong Kong before, though similar incident did happen on me for not only once.  Although the food served here is a bit fusion, I can say its service is typical Japanese based on my experience this time. On food, I ordered the eel & egg don set with yuzu ramen, while my colleague had yuzu ramen.  The eel was tender & had no bones.  Yuzu ramen with chicken meatballs was in chicken-based broth with some yuzu scent, where the broth was rich & creamy but not fatty or oily.   Given the quality of service & food here, I must come over again to give other dishes a try!",NOJO,4.5,150,nan,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-nojo/610909?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw
Central,Japanese,"Came here Saturday 2pm.  Half the menu is crossed out and many items we want to order is not available.  I would have walked out but since we had an appointment in an hour, we didnt have time to find another restaurant.  We ordered what food was available on the menu.  We ordered the grilled pineapple-the waitress a said they were out. We wanted the Japanese sweet potato-that was also out too.   We ended up ordering a grilled salmon roll.  I asked the waitress not to put any mayo-ofcourse unsurprisingly-the rolls came with mayo.  Disappointed. This may be the worst Japanese Izakaya I have ever been too.

Central,Japanese," Spicy Soup Ramen0 Spicy Soup RamenAs one who loves to indulge in spicy foods, I enjoyed having this  Spicy Soup Ramen. Sliced pork was tender without too much fat, noodles were done just right without being too soft.  Soup base was delicious, flavourful pork bone broth.  What I like is how ratio of soup is a lot more than the ramen noodles, this way, osmosis wont make the ramen noodles swell up, so so so importantGiven this said, its really impossible for these Japanese chain store ramen to taste bad, so I still give it 5 stars even though I wish it be more spicy, or come with more of the limited spicy sauce!",Ippudo HK,nan,100,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-ippudo-hk/96369?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw
Central,Japanese,"The restaurant is in Central, hidden in one of the small alleys. The chef was Japanese and he told us they only import the finest food ingredients from Japan. He and the staff were very kind and accommodating to our fish preferences. Each dish was very tasty and they paced it very well. One of my favourite dish was the unexpected Tamago-yaki. I thought it would be the same as those I've had outside but it was not. You wouldn't be able to tell it was tamago-yaki just by looking it either.The ambiance was also nice and quiet.

Central,Japanese,"It was my third visit.

After less than a year, price had inflated by $100 to $680 + 10%.I placed a reservation for a group of 5 on the same day for lunch on a weekday and still managed to get 5 seats at the sushi counter. Was it a recent trend for slightly higher-end restaurants like this nowadays?Salad and Steamed Egg Custard0Salad and Steamed Egg CustardOur first dish was the salad and steamed egg custard. Last time, there was an appetiser rather than a salad. Given the pretty bad quality of appetiser last time, the salad was definitely much better. The  was as usual. It was pretty good. It was served really hot. There were lots of ingredients but most of the crab meat was on the surface. The egg was very smooth.0Here you go our first sushi. It was  as always. This time it was , which had nothing special.0The second piece was  which was in season and tasted pretty good. I also had this sushi last time. 0 The third piece was with . It was outstanding with a perfect match between the fish and the toppings. The fish was in season and was again very fresh. You could also tell that the  was super fresh too. Well done indeed.0The fourth piece was, which I also had last time. The shrimps were minced so they were not so sticky texture-wise. Nothing new to me.0The 5th piece was , which I also had last time. The scallop was just standard. I think it could have been better, maybe because it had nothing new to me since I had it before.0The 6th piece was , which was new to me. The fish was in season and it was quite a good combo with the toppings of fish roes on top which were slightly salty. Delicious.0The 7th piece was , which was so so pretty! Texture-wise it was super crispy too. Taste-wise it was so fresh. Portion-wise it was so big. Very outstanding indeed.0The 8th piece was. Last time we had  but this time it looked so much better because the one we last had looked like one broken into different parts...However, taste-wise it was quite disappointing because I found it worse than those grab-and-go I bought from average supermarkets in Japan.0The 9th piece was . We used to have sea urchin presented in a much better way on a mini plate with loads of sea urchin. That said, this one was actually ok with fresh sea urchin and loads in terms of quantity. 0 The 10th piece was  which was new to me. It was made from minced  which was in season. The deep-fried onions on top enhanced the texture of the sushi. I really like new items like this given that I had visited this place more than once.0The 11th one was , which I also had last time. It was so fatty and I witnessed how it shrank in size after drilling. It was tasty.I forgot to take a photo of the 12th one which was , which I also had last time. It was super fatty and melted in my mouth immediately. All my lunch partners said it was delicious.0The last one was . I liked it especially how there were so much spring onions.Miso Soup0Miso SoupThere was nothing special with the miso soup.An ice-cream scoop was included in the lunch set, with a choice of green tea or black sesame. I had a mixture of green tea and black sesame (quite a creative offer to mix the two flavours together!).Despite the seemingly less crowded restaurant during this hour of the lunch (we actually came in at 1:30p.m.), service seemed to not have improved with no one to fill up our cups of tea and we always had to ask for refilling the sliced gingers for us. I really hope the restaurant has heard us and do something to improve their service given the small number of seats anyway.That said, with 13 pieces of sushi of such a quality at a price of $680+10%, I had to admit that it was quite a good value for money, less so though after the $100+10% inflation in price.

I was told that the more expensive set included 2 types of sashimi and two  but only 8 pieces of sushi and rolls. Hoping to try something better and different, we decided to go for the $800 set. As we were in a bit of rush, we asked for checking out by 1:30p.m.00The server dressed up in  was so kind to introduce the food to us in Cantonese after the chef's introduction to us in Japanese.

However, the male manager's level of service really ruined the whole dining experience. There seemed to be just one male manager and another server throughout lunch. My phone's photo-taking function was out of order in the middle of our meal and it took a while to fix it. It was when the male manager came over to ask us to eat faster to finish on time in a very rude manner. It really ruined the whole dining experience to be honest. I appreciated his reminder but he should have really delivered the message in a much softer way. I felt like I was scolded. When we asked for our desserts to check out, the manager didn't offer us any choice while we heard that the customers next to us got to choose between the yuzu sorbet and yoghurt mousse offered by another server. It took quite a long time for him to serve us the desserts which was done after checking out our bills too.

Anyway, as my friend had been there before, the sushi chef prepared our toppings according to what he thought shed like. It was about only about 60% the same as the couple next to us who also ordered the omakase i.e. the sets are quite customized.

Central,Japanese,"Lunch Menu1Lunch MenuIt was our second visit. Our first visit was over a year ago and we ordered the cheaper lunch set so we were quite pleased by their sushi but left with a not-so-full stomach. This time we decided to try their Omakase Sushi Sets (13 pieces) at $580+10%. It seemed to be quite a good value of money to have 4 more at an additional cost of $100+10%!Our first impression of the dining experience was not so good because the attitude of one of the waitresses was not so friendly. She ordered us to take our seats in a commanding tone and was not so friendly when we followed up with our Miso soup and ice-cream.Appetiser 1Appetiser Appetiser 0Appetiser Appetiser  was not good. They were just some pickled veggies which were too salty.10 was served really hot. It looked so lovely. It seemed to be the same as the one we ate last time.It smelt super good of yuzu when opened. It tasted so good of yuzu and crab meat when I ate it. There were lots of ingredients and the egg was very smooth. It was pretty good. If I had to pick bones from an egg, the chicken was a bit too rough.Pickled gingers0Pickled gingersThe pickled gingers were so thick. They didn't taste particularly good. My lunch partner saw them opening packaged pickled gingers to serve us. The chef was too busy refilling our pickled gingers too but was happy to serve us gingers when asked.1Here you go our first sushi.  looked so lovely with small flowers on top. It was fresh with nothing special.1Our second sushi . A pretty common sushi with nothing special either.0Our 3rd sushi . The shrimps were minced so they were not so sticky texture-wise. Still, it tasted fresh and was quite good.0Our 4th sushi . It smelt so good of black truffle even before eating. The scallop was so meaty. I saw the other customers ordering 9 pieces of sushi and their scallops didn't have black truffle on top toro0toroOur 5th sushi toro. It was really fatty and melted in my mouth.0Our 6th sushi . The fish wasn't very special but the crispy toppings did add some texture to it.0Our 7th sushi . I remembered we also had this last time. The dressing was very delicious. There were loads of fish on top with very colourful sesames!0Our 8th sushi . Again there were loads of sea urchin! They were fresh but a bit too cold though.Grilled 0Grilled Our 9th sushi grilled . Grilled fish was quite good with the nice grilled smell. It was quite fatty too but the seasoning was a bit too strong to make it a bit too salty.0Our 10th sushi . It was pretty fresh!  was usually pretty  but this one was prepared quite well that we didn't find it  at all!0Our 11th sushi . It was super fatty and melted in my mouth immediately.0Our 12th sushi . This one was really good. It was not salty at all despite the usually salty salmon roes, as it was balanced by the  and yuzu seasoning! It was so refreshing to the mouth!toro0toroOur 13th sushi toro grilled by . When we saw the chef take out the toro we were amazed how fatty it was! It was so fatty that it looked like pork belly! The seaweed was super crispy. The whole thing didn't taste so greasy after eating.Miso soup0Miso soupThe miso soup was so small but super concentrated.We got to choose either coffee or ice-cream. We both chose ice-cream of course.Yuzu Sherbet0Yuzu SherbetYuzu sherbet was pretty refreshing.Black Sesame Ice-cream0Black Sesame Ice-creamBlack sesame ice-cream was also quite delicious. A good end to the meal.This time I did feel full after the whole meal.The chef at the sushi bar who served us was so nice and friendly that he always wore a smile on his face and was so willing to answer questions. He gave us such a good dining experience despite the relatively poor service of one of the waitresses. Overall, It was quite a good value for money for 13 pieces of sushi with some less commonly served ones at such a price. Another pleasing thing about this place was that the chef was particularly good at putting different kinds of toppings on the sushi to at least decorate them if not adding different flavours / textures to the sushi. But we did feel a bit thirsty afterwards as all of their sashimi got served with a coat of soy sauce above. In short, I would recommend this place for some high-quality omakase sushi lunch sets. However, remember to allow sufficient time in advance to make reservations! And I really hope the service of their waitress could improve for our next visit.",Sushi IMA,nan,638,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-sushi-ima/512392?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
Central,Japanese,"In today's working environment, escape from the daily hustle seems like a near impossibility. Not only are we swamped with enless tasks and back-to-back deadlines, but in the age of mobile devices, getting away from work to enjoy a nice break almost seems laughable.But just when you thought that the notion of a little escape is out of reach,enter Fuku by Nishimura. When it comes to a nice place to have a quiet lunch, this place is an absolute gem.Nustled in a tiny corner of Admiralty, this place is an oasis right from the moment you enter the shop. The whole restaurant is nicely decorated, but most importantly the layout is effectively spaced and compartmentalized to facilitate quiet conversation.Furthermore, we were seated in alarge booth, offering maximum comfort and privacy - first class dining if there ever was such a thing. (But do make sure that you book well in advance)The avaliable food selection was adequate and we ended settling on the Tuna Rice and Assorted Sushi lunch sets.The sushi set was well portioned and would definitely keep you full for the afternoon slog, especially with the udon. Sure,the seafood was fresh and there was sufficient variety, but aside from this, the meal didn't really stand out. For example, there were no items that demonstrated extraordinary flair or creativity, which is what you would expect to come with the price premium.Things took a turn for the better however, with the arrival of the tuna don. The dish was beautifully presented with fat juicy slices of fish laid out on the fluffy serving of rice. Simplicity at it's finest, the freshness of the dish really came through.The bill, at alomost $400 per head, was not cheap, but given that Fuku by Nishimura offers one of the best place for a quiet escape, I'd say the price premium was well worth itTopped of with choice of dessert or drinks our meal was made complete with a nice chat over coffee, in this mini oasis.",Fuku By Nishimura,4.1,399,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-fuku-by-nishimura/469081?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw
Central,Japanese,Second time visiting this place. Went in on a weekday for lunch with the girlfriend. Did not have to wait long considering its lunch rush (1-2pm) Greeted to our table by the friendly staff. I ordered the Chasiu Soba and Tsukemen for the gf. Also ordered extra eggs and their chicken karage. Found it to be very delicious since soup and noodle texture is spot on. Have tried a couple of other Ramen/Soba places around HK but i have to say by far this is the best in HK. Price is reasonable too so definitely would recommend this place to anyone who have a taste for some good Soba. 0000,Zagin Soba,4.5,200,15,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-zagin-soba/551177?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw
Central,Japanese,"Very decent sushi restaurant, everything here just like you are having sushi in japan! So clean and every kitchenware and tableware are so tidy.Chef will prepare sushi in front of you, and give you on the wooden table instead of a plate, like typical sushi restaurant in japan.Here are the sushi, they are all fresh! Including those mackerel and bonito fish.And we particularly like the sea urchin, chef freshly pick them out from the sea water...yum yum For sure the tuna is nice!!!But only one thing is the vinegar they used for the sushi rice, personally think its taste too strong which will cover a bit the freshness taste of the fish. Reasonably to expect that the price will not be very attractive, because you are having fresh sushi in Central 000000",Sushi Nakamoto,3.5,600,nan,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-sushi-nakamoto/576545?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
Central,Japanese,"We had tried quite a few sushi bars in Central so I had done some research on openrice and saw this relatively new sushi bar. Time to try something new!We had reserved two seats at the sushi counter which wasn't full at all despite lunch hour on Friday.00The tableware was very lovely, offering a very good start to the meal beginning with my eyes and lifting my expectations.2We decided to order their 12-piece sushi set at $420+10%. The price set was somewhere in the middle between the top sushi bars and the cheaper ones in Central I must say.Pickled gingers0Pickled gingersVery soon we were welcomed by some pickled gingers. I had to admit that they were pretty bad. They were all well-prepared in advance and they were so thick cut and not particularly yummy. In fact I found them a bit too spicy. Yet I had to eat one piece in between the sushi to clear my mouth to try the next piece. Really disappointing indeed although they were not supposed to be the focus of the meal.Salad0SaladThe salad, which was included in the set, was quite fresh and there were quite a lot of veggies. The salad dressing was tasty but it was actually just standard.Steamed egg0Steamed eggThe steamed egg, which was also included in the set, looked pretty appealing. There were quite a lot of ingredients and the egg was indeed smooth. The taste was ok with the right degree of saltiness.0The first sushi was  with fresh seaweed on top. The chef introduced to us that the texture was a bit chewy. It was the first time that we heard about and tried this sushi. I actually tried to search for more information on the website about this sashimi but couldn't find much. It was really a bit chewy although I couldn't recall much about the taste afterwards except for the seaweed. The sushi rice was well seasoned although there could have been slightly more wasabi.0 almost always appeared as one of the first few sushis of such sushi set. It was fresh indeed but was like other similar sushi out there. No surprise.I forgot to take a photo of the 3rd sushi which was . Please excuse me for being unable to recall much about the taste without a photo0The 4th sushi was  which was quite fatty and was pleasing to the tongue! I recalled this one had slightly more wasabi than the previous sushi although I didn't know why.0 with lime and yuzu juices had a very interesting texture as it was crispy but not as crispy as those other shells you normally got. It was really refreshing with the lime and yuzu juices added.0I found this one taste a bit like red tuna although my lunch partner didn't agree. It was not particularly pleasing.0Then we waited for a long long time before our next sushi arrived because the chef was very busy preparing the omakase sets for others. It was quite pleasant watching the chef prepare food but unfortunately we still had to work after lunch!  had the typical sticky prawn sashimi texture which I really liked. The  was ok although I don't like it normally as it is usually too salty. Having said that, I think the quality of the prawn could have been much better, especially at this price.0 with salad dressing was served to us for free maybe as an apology for having kept us waiting. It was really appreciated. The  was very crispy and went well with the salad dressing. Although again we had to wait for quite a long while before our next sushi was served.0Starting from this sushi, the sushi rice started to fall apart when I tried to take it from the sushi plate to my own plate using chopsticks. I suspected that it was all because the chef was in a rush.0It was not fatty nor salty so I wondered why they served this in such an order? It was a bit too plain to me actually. By that time I had already asked for faster serving of sushi because we had to go soon so all the remaining sushi sort of rushed in. The chef did apologize to us.Toro0ToroToro was good as always but it was not the fattiest of all.0This one really melted in my mouth and it was so fatty!Uni0UniThe uni was quite fresh. For some reason, it was better when eaten with the whole thing in my mouth compared with just trying 1 slice of uni from the top.Udon0UdonWe had a choice of either miso soup or udon and we both went for the udon. The udon was a bit disappointing given the class of such a sushi restaurant because they could have been much smoother. The soup was ok as it tasted quite good.Black Sesame ice-cream0Black Sesame ice-creamWe had a choice of coffee or ice-cream and of course we went for the ice-cream. The quality of ice-cream was quite good.Although my stomach was quite big, I did feel full after finishing everything from the set.Overall, I would say the quality of the sushi was ok although more special sushi could have been served given the price. Moreover, I was really a bit disappointed by the sushi rice towards the end of the meal. At such a price, I think I would rather top up a little bit to go to those better sushi bars in the same district.",Sakura Japanese Cuisine,3.1,462,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-sakura-japanese-cuisine/566794?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
Central,Japanese,"5019 Premium Factory has peaked my interest for some time. I see them in all the Japanese pop up fairs. The smell of their burgers from those pop up fairs was astounding. That's when I discovered they had an actual restaurant! I had to try one of their burgers!Located in Central, it's found on the same street as that popular social media wall that all the tourists like to take a photo of. The restaurant isn't very big. There are a few tables and a long bar table on one side.0During weekday lunch time, they have a lunch set menu. Menu is in English only. Sets include a drink with sides.10I was interested in their burger so ordered the 5019 Wagyu BLT burger set, choosing the 120 gram portion ($138). It came with a side of salad and fries. First off ... the portions of the sides was quite generous. Salad greens were fresh. The fries were fantastic. Crispy and well seasoned.0The burger was quite a mouthful. There tomatoes, lettuce, bacon, pickled carrots, onions and an omelette! I didn't even get to the patty yet! The patty was moist and juicy. I love the sauce! It was sweet and savory. The bun was a sweet brioche. There was so much stuff, it was hard to hold together. This was a fantastic burger.0They gave me a point card upon leaving that was pretty easy to accumulate. Rewards include a side of chicken wings! Food was great. Service was friendly.

Central,Japanese,"This restaurant is located in an old building which is a bit out of my expectation but its cozy inside with a little balcony - should be good for small private party.Its my first time here with my 2 friends. We ordered 3 lunch sets to share. Its a 3-course lunch where we can pick our preferred starter, main and dessert.We tried the mushroom toast and seafood soup. The toast was fine - no surprise but the seafood soup did wow me with the ingredients inside. I guess I got like 3 mussels in a bowl which I didnt expect. (FYI, Im a mussel lover). For the main, we picked a lamb salad, slow cooked chicken and sea urchin pasta with beef. Front right: The salad tastes good and the lamb is just well cooked. Middle left: The chicken was another surprise. Its so tender and matched perfectly with the berry sauce. The Chinese Choy Sum on the side was creative but just didnt work out. It really dragged the whole dish a little bit down. Back right: Lastly, the sea urchins pasta didnt look good tbh - I expected it in orange rather than white when I saw sea urchins on the menu. To be fair, the menu did mention its in cream sauce so nth wrong with the color. We couldnt find any single piece of sea urchin but we could taste it. Its just amazing that it tasted way better than it looked. Overall speaking, all 3 mains were above average in terms of taste. Pretty satisfying but the portion is a bit small so I was not really full by the time we cleared the plates. Glad that dessert is included in that I still wanna eat. I ordered a pancake for myself and my friends got the green tea puddings. The pancake was not really the fluffy or American style. Its actually a pancake roll with cream inside - a bit out of my expectation. It tastes just so so but could make me feel the fullness more. The green tea pudding was just fair - better than the so-called pancake. The whole lunch experience was quite good given the quality of food (except dessert). Ill probably come back when I have lunch with Central buddies next time. 0",The Balcony,nan,125,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-the-balcony/543605?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

The portion of the rice was quite big. I did feel full after eating although I had been pretty hungry. It would have been better if the rice had been made with more vinegar and less moist. The wasabi could have been more fresh and was below average.A salad and a miso soup came with the don. The salad was quite fresh with 2 pieces of orange which were really appreciated. The miso soup was better than average because there were quite some veggies in it.Overall, the tuna salmon don was quite a good deal especially with the 20% discount by reservation on openrice!

Central,Japanese,"To be honest, I wouldn't have visited this place if simply considering its name. Because its name reminded me of another modern Chinese restaurant in the same building charging food at a premium for its creativity of the interior decorations and names only while the portion of the food was so tiny. However, we decided to give it a try as there was omakase sushi lunch sets at quite an economical price.We asked for seats at the sushi counter so that we could enjoy omakase sushi the best. I had made the reservation with a discount offered by the openrice and there was some confusion when I double confirmed with the staff while checking in so that our lunch experience didn't start off so smoothly. Anyway, I cared more about the quality of the food.1We both ordered Nigiri sushi (8 pieces) with udon. It seemed that prices had already inflated compared with those mentioned at recent comments on openrice. Maybe the promotion season was over.Small Side Dish & Salad1Small Side Dish & SaladThe small side dish with small fishes tasted quite good. They were not salty at all. The salad was normal.Steamed Egg0Steamed EggThe steamed egg was not hot but pretty smooth with quite a lot of ingredients like chicken, mushroom, prawn, etc. It was quite good.Pickled ginger slices0Pickled ginger slicesThe chef who served us was from HK and he was quite attentive to us (as we arrived so early so he basically just served us). The pickled ginger slices were quite disappointing as the quality was just like those at Genki Sushi, really nothing compared with those served at professional sushi bars. Anyway the chef kept refilling for us as we had a habit of eating one to two slices of pickled ginger before trying the next sushi.Sushi 1: 1Sushi 1: The chef sprinkled some seasoning on top. There was also some jelly on top of the sushi. It was ok. But I think they didn't add much soy sauce to the sushi in general so I found them a bit too plain. I had expected that I didn't have to add any other seasoning to the sushi after being tailor made by the chef.Sushi 2: 0Sushi 2: A very common sushi. Nothing special to talk about.Sushi 3: 0Sushi 3: It was so thick and meaty with strong yuzu and lemon juice. The texture was so good and it was so fresh, although I personally didn't fancy such a strong yuzu and lemon flavour.Sushi 4:  with caviar0Sushi 4:  with caviarI actually tried 1 caviar first and the caviar was tasteless!

I had expected just a simple ice-cream scoop. It was really disappointing.Overall, I would say the quality of the sushi was better than I had expected from the price especially given the location in Central. I even enjoyed an early bird 15% discount which made it an even better deal. Definitely no harm to try given such a price.

Central,Japanese,"Today I would like to show my friend the best tempura in town. So I bring them to Tenkai at Sheung Wan Aberdeen road.it is only twelve at noon, the shop is queue up with number of people, unbelievable!They provided Premium lunch set for Weekend -Four types of tempura lunch , including tenkai Ten-Don set, tempura lunch sets and tempura lunch special set, Ranges from $180-$300. The major difference between those lunch set is the number of tempura pieces served. Today I encores the Tempura lunch special set $300, 9 pieces of Japanese authentic tempura .The whole set comes with: Shrimp, sea urchin, white fish, conger eel, tenkai egg, Sakura shrimp and veggies (Includes soup , two appetizers and two free rice. )The weather is so hot today, and The iced green tea comes in the right moment ! It is from Shizuoka, the taste is so mild and smooth, with the cold ice, what a delightful healthy drink in summer.All the tempura is so good! Perfectly done!  I cant find any one of them I dont like. It is Served piece by piece. And All the seafood is freshly imported from Tsukuji market in japan! All The appetizers is quite tasty 11and the soup is light and refreshing.1First dish is shrimp tempura and white fish. 1Though the shrimp is not huge, but The shrimp is so fresh and the shrimp head is so crispy! Like it! The white fish is coated with a thin layer of batter, crispy outside and very soft inside, with light fish flavor. Now here comes a slightly stronger flavor - The conger eel . 1The eel got stronger taste and it is a bit firmer than the fish. The vegetable tempura is very nice too. 1This time I drip the veggies with salt Instead of tempura sauce. The apparatus is really tender and juicy, the lotus seed root is crisp and crunchy, and pumpkin tempura is so soft and sweet. Everyone of them got diverse texture and taste.And then here comes the highlight of the meal: sea urchin! 1The sea urchin tempura is so so sweet!! It is so creamy and soft , contrasting with a thin layer of batter, almost melts in my mouth completely! Love it!! . I also enjoy the tenkai egg a lot! 1Thats the other highlight of the meal. Not many restaurants do the tempura eggs, while this requires high level of skills. The tenkai egg is semi cooked, covered with extra thin layer of batter. I cut the egg into half, the orangey egg yolk just flows onto the rice. 1Mix it together with a bit of wasabi and tenkai sweet soy sauce , it is so creamy and rich. A bit creaminess, a bit of wasabi spiciness and a bit sweetness of the tenkai soy sauce. what a simple heavenly flavor! The Sakura shrimps tempura is the third and last highlight of the meal. 1The shrimps are so tiny , but with really strong shrimp flavor! Mix it together with the broth, seaweed and white rice, it becomes chazuke. 1The soup is so clear and smooth, with a hint of seafood taste, together with soften Sakura shrimps and seaweed, it is umami, tasty and moist, also a perfect ending for the seafood tempura meal. All of us really enjoy the meal. however the pace of serving tempura is too fast. One comes another non-stop. That may be due to lots of customers waiting outside, so the chef have to served the tempura really quick for another round. Anyway, I still enjoy the high quality of tempura here,  from the rhythm of light tastes tempura to strong taste tempura. I definitely will come back again for more.",TENKAI,4.6,330,45,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-tenkai/470394?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

Central,Japanese,"I remembered coming across this restaurant on some news earlier. But it was not the reason of our visit. It was my lunch partner who found this place on openrice by searching ""yakiniku"" but we ended up not eating ""yakiniku"" for lunch.0This restaurant was quite nicely decorated. It was quite empty despite lunch hour on a week day.Lunch menu0Lunch menuThe Japanese Appetisers, Salads and Oden Buffet cost $138+10% and you got to choose different mains at different costs which included miso soup, steamed egg, pickles and dessert.Japanese Appetisers, Salads and Oden Buffet$ 1520Japanese Appetisers, Salads and Oden Buffet$ 152There were not too many different food items on the buffet table, but more than enough to fill the stomach. The quality was ok in general in terms of buffet, although I would say most were quite salty. There were some really fresh and crispy greens, carrot/cucumber/celery sticks, smoked salmon, 3 types of cheese (quality a bit sub-par), cherry tomatoes, sweet corn, some pre-mixed salads with Japanese dressings like sesame, Japanese-style appetisers like  but they were really cold, Japanese-style small dried fish, sliced Italian-style veggies and some cooked chicken slices which were really hard. The oden was ok, although not as good as those served at convenience store in Japan of course! For fruits, there were only some dragon fruits and pineapples. My personal opinion was that, the cost of $138+10% seemed not so justified by this simple buffet, so you really have to top it up by ordering a main.Unagi Don - Eel Rice Bowl$ 660Unagi Don - Eel Rice Bowl$ 66Unagi Don - Eel Rice Bowl$ 660Unagi Don - Eel Rice Bowl$ 66The rice and the eel were hot! There were quite some eel which were of reasonably good quality as expected. There was plentiful eel sauce in the rice.

The miso soup was normal.Sukiyaki Don - US Prime Beef Rice Bowl$ 660Sukiyaki Don - US Prime Beef Rice Bowl$ 66Sukiyaki Don - US Prime Beef Rice Bowl$ 660Sukiyaki Don - US Prime Beef Rice Bowl$ 66Comparatively, this sukiyaki don was less delicious as the beef was quite rough and fatty without much sukiyaki flavour. The quantity of beef was quite a lot though. The vegetables like those onions and leek tasted better. The half boiled egg mixed with the rice made the rice very smooth and was really delicious!Dessert - Chocolate ice cream0Dessert - Chocolate ice creamThe accompanying ice cream was quite thick and dense. A perfect end to the meal!Overall, we had quite a satisfying lunch with reasonably good quality of Japanese food. Service was quite attentive as the waiters/waitresses took away the finished plates quite promptly. It was quiet enough for a nice chat over lunch.

The mix berry smoothie was just like juice and it was not milky at all. The Spinach Green smoothie was made up of spinach, banana, mango etc and was slightly more milky.

The Raclette cheese was really the highlight of the burger. It tasted quite salty but it was so good! It was so thick despite having melted. However, the patty was too salty and broke into minces so easily. The bun was toasted well and it was so crispy. Overall, we were a bit disappointed by the Wagyu patty.The accompanying fries were quite subpar. Although freshly deep-fried, some of them seemed over-deep-fried and some of them were too thin with too much batter. So you know why there were quite some leftover by others.

I was told that itwas the only dessert so we decided to give it a try.It was to our surprise when it was served to us, as it was served on a teppan with all the exciting cooking sound! The toast was deep fried and soaked in honey. It was so crispy and sweet and it went really great with the vanilla ice cream. I was glad that it was vanilla ice cream rather than something more heavy to balance the heaviness of the deep-fried toast and chocolate sauce. Yummy and special dessert indeed.Overall food quality seemed ok despite the rather disappointing Wagyu patty. Given the cost and the location, there were definitely better burger places in the same district with better chips and shakes.

Central,Japanese,"This place intrigued me as its quite hard to find authentic Japanese restaurants in Central. Since it was weekend lunch, seating wasnt a problem. Decor was very minimalist, and one of the chef was native Japanese. As brunch, we ordered the uni/minced tuna rice bowl, and another sashimi lunch set. With the dishes being raw ingredients based, we were able to taste its freshness. The sashimi set also served raw tuna and octopus, both being difficult ingredients to serve as tuna can easily have gamy flavor and raw octopus can easily turn foul. But the raw tuna tasted very light and fresh, with the raw octopus not having any slime and tasted light like squid. Even though for lunch it wasnt cheap, but definitely an alternative instead of heading towards Causeway Bay where its heavily Japanese cuisine based. 10",Gyotaku,4.7,300,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-gyotaku/49901?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

Central,Japanese,"Figaro is a small restaurant located in the Gough Street area. It was something the caught my eye for it featured Japanese inspired French cuisine. Quite honestly, I love how the Japanese have created their own versions of Western food and it's often really fantastic and inspiring.I arrived at lunch. It was pretty full and I was given the last table. And there I sat. For a long LONG time before someone came over and asked if I was ready to order. I replied that I was provided with no menu. The waiter apologized and then gave me the lunch menu. Before I could look at the menu, another waiter came over and stood next to me, pen poised. I didn't expect to be paying over a $100 for lunch to only have cha chan teng service. I told him that I just got the menu and so he so ""Oh, I'll come back later. I see you're not ready to order."" You're right, buddy! I just told you I just got the menu!ANYWAYS .... Lunch menu is in English and Chinese. It includes a main and soup. You can upgrade with appetizers, drinks and dessert with a certain amount of money. There apparently is a minimum charge of $88 per person, so no sharing of one set.0They also have a daily special lunch sets. Of whatever they want to point out. This includes an appetizer, soup, main, drink and dessert for $218. I chose the Hiroshima oysters and clams Provence style.0The appetizer was (from left to right) tuna cerviche topped with black fish roe, Japanese potato salad and mixed greens with sesame dressing The cerviche was refreshing and nicely complemented with the crunchy roe on top. The potato salad was creamy and what I like about Japanese potato salad. The mixed salad, however, was ok but I found a number of browning greens.0The soup was a crab soup with a heavy handed drizzle of truffle oil and an odd streak of black pepper. This was disappointing because all I could taste was truffle oil. Though I did find lovely chunks of crab meat throughout. The soup was also very VERY creamy.0Then my main arrived. This was fabulous! Lots of clams with meat in each one. There were also 2 big Hiroshima oysters. The seafood was cooked perfectly. But it was the sauce was the winner. A rich tomato based sauce that was fragrant with an added kick of heat from the chili added.0This came with a plate of garlic black pepper rice. A welcome addition to soak up as much of that wonderful sauce as possible.0Dessert was a choice of roll cake or creme brulee. Roll cake was my only choice and I was not disappointed. A soft sesame roll cake with a sakura cream. It was not too sweet and was a total highlight.0My drink was an ice orange tea. This was nice and refreshing with a whole piece of orange in it. The tea wasn't infused with orange flavor so I had to poke at the pulp to release orange flavor.0The food was quite good. Well, aside from the mediocre appetizer and over truffle oil soup. But the rest was astouding. The only thing I didn't like and is reason I really won't be back or at least create extreme hesitation for me to return is the service. First, I wasn't provided with a menu. Then when I was provided with one, I was expected to order like some sort of cha chan teng. Next when my food arrived, the waiter noticed I had no eating utensils. Then he noticed he didn't even wipe the table. Don't you do these things before your diner sits down? Another thing was how fast everything came out. I had EVERYTHING in front of me (including dessert and drink) at once. I guess if you want a fast lunch, this is the place for you. If you want a quiet relaxing lunch this may not be for you. It's sad really as I did like the food. It's too bad the service made me think twice.

It was very moist which was the type I liked but it was not sour enough.0As soon as I finished my diced sashimi rice, these 2 arrived. They smelt so good of fatty fish oil. There were 5 thick pieces!

It was served with unagi sauce and a house special sauce that tasted a bit like siracha. There was a few slices of pickled daikon that weren't sour at all. I wonder if they were even pickled? The maki was ok. It did fall apart quite easily when I picked it up with my chopsticks. Love the crunch of the tempura shrimp and the freshness of the ingredients.0I added $8 for a miso soup.

I liked it enough but it also oddly reminded me of the Japanese in Canada. When I had never tried actual Japanese food. It felt like the westernized Japanese. It wasn't terrible but it also wasn't really Japanese. Items I'd find at a food truck in the US. That type of food. Would I be back?

The eggs were really smooth with a strong flavour of tofu. The texture was quite interesting given the crispy . (rib eye, sirloin & shoulder from the bottom to top)...0 (rib eye, sirloin & shoulder from the bottom to top)...The order of eating was from bottom to top in the increasing level of fat. This was the portion for two persons, which was quite small given the price I would say.Vegetable Plate from Japan0Vegetable Plate from JapanThe Japanese chef who served us was so nice to ask if there was anything we didn't like on this vegetable plate maybe because he noticed that I was checking out the veggies.Beef fat0Beef fatThen the chef started the sukiyaki by the beef fat.Japanese egg dip0Japanese egg dipWhen my lunch partner finished one egg, the chef asked if he would like to have one more without anybody telling us that they were going to charge us $20 more. We were a bit surprised when we saw that on the bill. Next time we should really remember to ask before ordering.Sukiyaki with rib eye & leek0Sukiyaki with rib eye & leekThen the chef started the sukiyaki with rib eye and leek. It was quite enjoyable watching the chef cook for us, like the way he sprinkled sugar and added sauce onto the food. Maybe most of the cost of the meal really went to the service of the chef. But when he was cooking towards the end, the sukiyaki pot spilt out some sauce onto my face and blouse. It was ok. The chef did apologise.Rice0RiceWe were given a very small bowl of rice which could be refilled for free. The rice was quite moist which was my cup of tea.1st bowl: rib eye & leek01st bowl: rib eye & leekIt was the first bowl prepared by the chef. The rib eye didn't have a strong flavour of beef nor a strong flavour of yummy sukiyaki sauce. It was quite disappointing indeed. Dipping into the egg just made the sukiyaki sauce even more diluted.2nd bowl: Japanese vegetables02nd bowl: Japanese vegetablesThe second bowl was all vegetables. I thought vegetables should be served later after eating more beef. The vegetables could have been better, especially those cabbages which were a bit rough. The tofu were quite good though. The tofu-like cube on the left was very smooth!3rd bowl: sirloin03rd bowl: sirloinThe third bowl was sirloin with some refreshing greens. The sirloin tasted more or less like the rib eye.4th bowl: onion04th bowl: onionIt was a very pretty and nicely presented onion. I could eat it ring by ring!5th bowl: sirloin, potato noodles & leek05th bowl: sirloin, potato noodles & leekThere was some leftover sirloin with potato noodles and leek. The potato noodles didn't taste particularly good as they didn't absorb the sauce well. It was really quite disappointing.6th bowl: shoulder06th bowl: shoulderThe shoulder gave a much richer taste of beef than rib eye and sirloin. The greens were so pretty with a nicely tied knot. Still the beef was not comparable to those we recently ate in Tokyo...Miso soup0Miso soupThe best thing about this was the tofu cubes at the bottom.7th bowl: udon with beef & eggs07th bowl: udon with beef & eggsWe could choose between rice and udon. Of course we went for the udon. The chef cooked udon first and then beef pieces with our leftover eggs to make the toppings. The udon looked really nice with the toppings. The udon itself was pretty good, not super al dente but acceptable, and it was very smooth. Again, it was not comparable to those sukiyaki noodles we ate in Tokyo.Green tea ice cream0Green tea ice creamThe ice cream was ok.Hot lemon water0Hot lemon waterWe asked for hot lemon water (they didn't offer cold drinks) instead of coffee.Overall, I would say this set was quite pricey at $580 + 10% considering the quality of the beef and the portion. I had expected better quality of the beef and sukiyaki itself (although my expectation could have been too high given our recent amazing sukiyaki experience in Tokyo). Having said that, the service of the Japanese chef (but not the staff) was quite good.

Central,Japanese,"I am sure that there are enough commentaries on how good their Kikusan Rolls are. But there may not be any commentary about how they are like without uni. And how fortunate that we came across Kikusan Rolls without uni as we were told that they were running out of uni...Kikusan Rolls without uni$ 750Kikusan Rolls without uni$ 75I didn't think they added more minced toro to make up for the lack of uni as promised, maybe just salmon roe. Having said that, I think they still tasted good. The salmon roe was not salty at all while the minced toro was pretty smooth. I also liked the onions served on top! Yet I could only give an average rating for the disappointment due to the lack of uni, which definitely dragged down the value for money of this dish. Steamed Pork & Soup Dumpling$ 530 Steamed Pork & Soup Dumpling$ 53The dumplings I ate broke easily so that some soup leaked out. Otherwise they tasted quite good with loads of soup and reasonably thick wrap. Chilli Sesame & Peanut Soup Ramen with Minced Pork & Layer Pork Cutlet...$ 790 Chilli Sesame & Peanut Soup Ramen with Minced Pork & Layer Pork Cutlet...$ 79The layer pork cutlet was good, with thin batter and reasonably tender pork chop. The soup was slightly chilli which was of a good degree but it didn't have enough peanut flavour which was quite a failure for a traditional peanut soup ramen like this. The ramen itself was quite sub-par too, which was not al dente at all... Steamed Spinach Wrap Shrimp Dumpling$ 460 Steamed Spinach Wrap Shrimp Dumpling$ 46The one was quite good. The wrap was refreshing although didn't offer sufficiently strong spinach flavour. The shrimp filling was big and meaty! Yummy!

This time we decided to try this one. But it really lacked green tea or red bean flavour...Only the crispy nuts were good. It was very disappointing. The only good thing was that it was not too sweet due to the lack of green tea/red bean flavour... Chargrilled Beef$ 1630 Chargrilled Beef$ 163This one came last because we ordered it quite late. It was the worst dish of the day. We were a bit surprised that a steak came out instead of just normal beef. But it was totally lack of chargrilled flavour and it was so rough. It was really bad and we had to finish it off with the accompanying sauce.Overall, it was still a good place to go given its convenient location and reasonable price. Just that maybe it's better to stick to its signature dishes and don't try new dishes.

Central,Japanese,"We called to reserve a table in less than an hour before we arrived and still managed to get a table. We had been craving some high quality yakiniku again so decided that we would go for yakiniku lunch sets right away. However, there were quite a few choices of yakiniku lunch sets and it took us a while to decide to go for two Deluxe Yakiniku Sets at $220 each. All set came with miso soup, appetizer, salad, rice and ice-cream. We also paid $66 for an extra order of beef tongues + chicken and another $66 for another extra order of chicken + pork.Salad, Appetizer (Bamboo shoot & Beef), Beef Fat & Roast Meat Sauce...0Salad, Appetizer (Bamboo shoot & Beef), Beef Fat & Roast Meat Sauce...The salad and appetizer arrived very soon after they had taken our orders. The salad and bamboo shoot were ok but the beef was so hard so that the below average mark was mostly due to the beef. The roast meat sauce was totally unnecessary because I found that the beef itself was seasoned very well.Deluxe Yakiniku Set$ 2200Deluxe Yakiniku Set$ 220The waitress didn't introduce the beef when she brought them to us. So we asked. Those on the left were  which were off the menu while those on the right were flank steak. The flank steak looked pretty mouth-watering right? We asked if there was any recommended order of eating and the waitress answered ""up to you"".0So we started off with the less fatty  before our additional orders arrived. The  were quite yummy. They were not super super tender like those at 298 Nikuya Room but were still ok texture-wise and had strong flavour of beef.Beef Tongues & Chicken, raw on plate$ 660Beef Tongues & Chicken, raw on plate$ 66Then our extra order of beef tongues and chicken arrived. The portion was a bit disappointing because last time our extra order of beef tongues at 298 Nikuya Room was so big and it was only $55!The roasted chicken was very tender, smooth and had strong flavour of chicken. A waiter said they imported everything from Japan. No wonder. We hadn't had such high quality chicken in a long time.Beef Tongues0Beef TonguesThe beef tongues were quite chewy, unlike those at 298 Nikuya Room which were super tender. I would say such chewy texture was also good.Flank Steak0Flank SteakFlank Steak0Flank SteakThe flank steak were of course very tender given the fat distribution. But my lunch partner said the  gave a stronger flavour of beef. I personally found the flank steak too fatty. The  was good enough if you wanted to consume less fat.The rice was just plain rice, a lot worse than those offered by 298 Nikuya Room which was so moist and smelt so good. As the rice was not particularly good, I didn't ask for more despite the need to eat more rice to balance the fatty meat.Chicken and Pork$ 660Chicken and Pork$ 66Then our extra order of chicken and pork arrived. It arrived last as we didn't place this order at the very beginning. There was nothing special with the pork. The pork did taste good but it was too fatty and there were only 2 slices. The above average rating was mostly due to the chicken.Ginger & Red Bean Ice-cream0Ginger & Red Bean Ice-creamOne of the good things about this set was that ice cream was included after eating so much fatty meat! The ginger ice-cream was ok but there were some tiny ice cubes in the red bean ice-cream. Maybe just couldn't expect too much from these freebies.Apology for comparing this place with 298 Nikuya Room throughout this commentary given our recent yakiniku experience at 298 and their close location. I would say 298 Nikuya Room was better in terms of the types of beef included in the set (they offered both thin and thick cuts and different parts of the beef for you to try), bigger portions (also taking into account extra orders), service and ventilation. But of course 298 Nikuya Room was slightly more expensive and you couldn't occupy their tables for so long during lunch hours.

The quality of the sashimi was quite good: the uni, although far far from top-notch quality, didn't have any weird taste; the scallops were fresh; the crab meat was not the average crab stick you normally got out there; and the salmon was ok too.

Central,Japanese,"Much as I love ramen, I still have yet to try Shugetsu (Chinese name: ). Originally from Japan, their first branch in Hong Kong is located in Sheung Wan on Gought Street. They became so popular they opened another branch in Quarry Bay. Garnering a Michelin Bib for four years now, they are a must for many ramen fans.So, why haven't I tried it yet?Mainly for their soup base. A fish based broth that people have reported to have a very vinegar like taste. I wasn't sure. Would I like it? It always made me pause.As I was at PMQ to view the Mlle Prive exhibition, I decided to pop here for lunch.1Inside was the design was all in wood. Just like the front of the restaurant. It gave it a very retro ramen feel.0They have one room where you can see where they make the noodles.0Even the design of the menu was very nice and was wood.0Menu is in English and Chinese. You order off the menu.0As they are famous for tsukemen, boyfriend and I both ordered a bowl. For price, you can choose how much noodles (100g, 200g and 300g) at no additional charge. You can also choose how rich you want your broth and if you want hot or cold noodles.I chose the Shugetsu tsukemen in a light broth for $89. It included half an egg and no char siu. Just noodles. This is the 200g portion. It looked big but actually, it was placed on top of a bamboo mat. The noodles were the thick kind and were ok. The egg was super salty.0The soup was really sour. I expected it to be sour but wow ... was it ever sour. It was like drinking a bottle of vinegar. It was also lukewarm. As I ordered cold noodles, I expected the soup to be piping hot so it would balance out as that is how a good tsukemen is served. But as it was lukewarm, dunking my cold noodles into it just further made the soup cold. I wasn't too pleased and I guess here you have to break with tradition and order hot noodles instead. But oddly while dipping my noodles, the acidity lessened somewhat. Or maybe I was getting used to it? I also found the soup to be far too oily. There was a thick layer of oil on top. After I was done eating my noodles, I asked for soup. But instead of how most places just give you a thermos kettle of clear broth, this place has the staff pour it for you. And did they really dilute it! They pretty much diluted it to the top of my bowl. it was so much, I couldn't finish it. But after the addition of clear broth, the acidity lessened even more. It actually tasted better.0Boyfriend wanted meat so he ordered the one with grilled Kurobuta pork belly ($112) in 300 g size. This, too, was placed on top of a bamboo mat to make it appear like it was falling over. But in actuality, it wasn't lot of noodle. The pork belly was ok. I felt it didn't melt in my mouth and it was super oily. Boyfriend liked it more than me.0His broth was more stronger as he wanted a rich broth. Somehow, ordering the richer broth the vinegar taste wasn't as strong. It was there, but not as strong. It was more balanced with the taste of the fish.0I didn't like it as much as boyfriend. He loved it. So, I guess if you would like to try it, I would suggest the richer broth. They do have regular ramen along with an abura version (where you just get noodles without soup and it's rolled in oil). Would I be back? Perhaps to try the abura. I wasn't a big fan of the acidity of the broth. But people tell me that this place you either hate it or you love it. For me?

Central,Japanese,"Summary: If you like sushi rolls, but wish they had more exciting ingredients (or had non-raw fillings), Chotto Maki is the place for you. A light, fresh and tasty high-concept lunch spot. Try the pre-set rolls!Chotto Maki is a cool idea  giant but affordable sushi rolls that you stuff with any number of ingredients, freshly prepared on the spot. Each order comes with four giant pieces and costs about HKD 60-70. For normal people, I think its just the right serving size for lunch, though guys might want to add an extra ingredient or some other toppings.Though they only prepare sushi rolls, if you like vinegared rice wrapped in seaweed, you have quite a bit of freedom to stuff them with whatever youre feeling like that day. I tried the DIY version with salmon, mixed greens, seaweed (more like kelp), avocado, a Tobiko (flying fish roe) topping, with their house sauce / wasabi mayo tastefully drizzled over the top. While it was tasty and fresh, I felt like I wasnt embracing the concept fully, and when I tried my friends Beef-iyaki roll (which was DELICIOUS) I got it.Dont think of this place as a traditional sushi joint. This is not a place for purists; fish-wise, only tuna and salmon are offered, and while good, I think choosing fish is missing the point. You should be going for maximum impact with the non-traditional ingredients and their delicious homemade sauces. Try their pre-set rolls first, which are packed with complementary (sometimes surprisingly complementary) ingredients and, while they sound kinda nuts, are flavor-packed. After all, you can get a salmon avocado roll anywhere, but where else can you get a Teriyaki beef, cucumber, tofu skin, avocado, garlic chip, Unagi sauce roll?Overall, Chotto Maki is a nice addition to Central lunching (something new for a change!), and the price point and freshness of ingredients are a big plus. Its not for everyone of course, but if you go in with an open mind (Embrace the Flavor!), you wont be disappointed.",Chotto Maki,4.2,70,nan,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-chotto-maki/551993?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

Must say that they were really efficient. However, I was so so disappointed that it was just shabu-shabu in sukiyaki soup base rather than real sukiyaki. I think the name ""Mini Sukiyaki"" and that person answering our query over the phone the day before were really deceiving.00Heard that they offered . Maybe the quality of these beef slices was not so good, I found them not so up-to-standard because they totally lacked the taste of beef and they were just too fatty. The beef couldn't offer a rich flavour of the sukiyaki soup base either although I had tried to soak the beef into the soup. Maybe should have soaked them for longer, despite the risk of overcooking the beef.0However, I had to admit that the presentation looked very appealing!Raw Egg0Raw EggThe egg was very good, offering a strong egg flavour which smelt so good and was so smooth. Could tell that it was imported from Japan. It looked so pretty and the egg yolk was a bit hard to break.Vegetables & Udon0Vegetables & UdonThere were some veggies and udon underneath the beef. The vegetables tasted much better than the beef, well absorbing the sukiyaki soup base. The mushrooms, in particular, tasted really delicious which were so sweet and went along well with the soup base. The udon was so smooth too! I wish there were more udon.Rice0RiceCould tell that the rice should be imported from Japan as well. They were quite moist which I really liked although I normally don't like rice. So generous that they were willing to give you more when asked.Miso soup was served really really hot! Great for the low temperature! Nothing special about the pickles.Strawberry Ice-cream0Strawberry Ice-creamAlthough not specified on the menu, ice-cream was offered to end the meal. It was really appreciated because I'm such an ice-cream lover. The bowl and the spoon were kept cold to serve the ice-cream.

Today we decided to give it a try at Michelin 2-starred restaurant Kashiwaya Hong Kong, which is the only overseas branch of the famous Michelin 3-starred restaurant Kashiwaya in Osaka.In order to reserve a table, we had to decide the menu and give them credit card authorisation of the full payment at least 3 days beforehand. I had asked for seats at the bar table to try to maximise our kaiseki experience. When we checked in at our seats, we were greeted by our nicely-printed lunch menus and the Head Chef Atsushi Takahashi who was slicing sashimi for ourTsukuri.

We had tried better food of a greater portion and at a cheaper cost in Kyoto. Maybe it is just unreasonable to expect the same in Hong Kong.

Central,Japanese,"On a holiday noon, what better way to spend my lunch other than with my loved ones. As she like Japanese food, i decided to bring her to this restaurant as the reviews are quite good on Openrice. It was located on Central, just a couple minutes walk from Central MTR. They offer quite a wide range of Japanese food, ranging from sushi, sashimi, and meat etc. When we reached slightly after 12pm, the place was already almost full. I guess it was so popular as their menu was quite comprehensive. Banana beef rollThis was also one of the better beef roll i have tasted. Beef was sliced till thin, juicy and tender at the same time. The only thing is that the rice roll was quite huge in portion, and may not be able to fully taste the beef instead. Soft shell crab hand roll Portion was quite huge, as the soft shell crab was overflowed wrapped in a seaweed roll. In order to enhance the taste, i poured some soy sauce in it so that it can be slightly flavourful. It was crispy on the outside and yet the meat was soft. Grilled steak we ordered a main course. Even though the steak was cooked slightly towards well done with not much redness in it, but the meat was still soft and tender. Sauce was poured onto it.Clams with sake Normally when i dine in a chinese resturant, clams was usually cooked in black bean sauce or the chinese way of cooking. When i comes to a Japanese restaurant, i will definitely want to try it being cooked in a different way. I liked the way how the soup taste, as the sake did not overwhelm the whole dish completely. The soup was clear and sweet, with the clams juicy as well. We practically finish drinking the whole soup off.  00",Tsukiji,4.5,100,8,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-tsukiji/14620?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

Central,Japanese,"5th October 2017. It was an amazing experience to have omakase lunch at Sushi Shin, a newly opened sushi restaurant on On Lan Street. We went in a group of three. And we ordered the 12 pieces nigiri sets. It turned out all the nigiri were up to a premium standard and precisely made! 1- Marinated octopus in Japanese soy sauce. Its a very refreshing piece to start our dining experience with! The octopus taste so fresh with a well balanced flavour of the custom made sauce, it was tender, sweet with a nice bit of crunch and crackle with each bite. Its definitely a nice opening dish.2- Steamed egg with salmon roes topping. It was a perfect match, the sweetness of the egg engaged well with the salmon roes.3- Karei |  It was a mild flavour white fish to start with, light and tasty with a sweet after taste.4- Kinmetai |  Chef has slightly seared the surface/skin of the fish, its fattiness and oil enriched the tasting experience of having this piece!5- Chutoro | The Chutoro nigiri was strong, juicy, fatty and sweet! Wild toro has a slightly richer flavour than normal tuna, with an enhanced after taste.6- Siro ebi | It was so fresh and sweet! As you all know I will never take prawns in my life, but after Adachi san introduced this piece to me.. I have definitely got a completely different perspective towards ebi. I love the after taste!7- Hotatekai | The hotatekai nigiri was so tender and fresh. It has been a while since I had fresh hotatekai!8- Aji | Chopped ginger and the sauce enriched Aji. The skilful kiss-cuts on the back of the fish enhanced the texture of the piece!9- Kohada | Kohada is always a signature sushi of Tokyo Edomae sushi. It has been seasoned with salt and marinated in rice vinegar before it was served. It taste slightly lighter than other shops I personally think, but still very nice.10- Kinki | Special treat from the head chef, the kinki was so soft and juicy, its skin was crunchy and rich! The marinated radish went so well with the fish with a slight sour flavour, definitely brought it to another level!11- Maguro | Marinated tuna with homemade soy sauce. The sauce married so well with the tuna, its less fat but yet tender. I like it long lasting after taste!12- Wild Salmon | It was one of the highlight of the day. Chef has aged the salmon for a day, marinated it in customised soy sauce and slightly smoked it with Sakura wood! It was definitely a surprise for me how good salmon can be. The treatment made it unique and outstanding! Its texture was so soft and smooth, its flavour was rich and ever better with a fine touch of woodiness from Sakura wood.13- Uni | Hokkaido uni marinated in between seaweed. The uni became much more delicate and it has fully engaged with the flavour of the seaweed sauce. Its outstanding indeed.14- Tuna hand roll | The seaweed was so crispy, and the chopped fatty tuna was very juicy.15- Anago (sea salt) | Seared anago marked the end of the day. It was seasoned with sea salt. Its so soft that it melted in my mouth straight a way!16- Anago (soy sauce) | This was even better than the last piece! The sauce worked very well with the seared anago and its the perfect amount! Its awesome.17- Tamago | Homemade panna cotta by Chef Adachi.

Civilized environment, no queue and no one piling food onto their plate. Music was just loud enough without intruding but shut out the conversations from neighboring tables.

Our mini Kaiseki consists of 6 courses:1. SakizukeSimple and at the same time sophisticated mixed of ingredients mixed together as a starter.  Signal of summer time is about to arrive.  The sweet sea urchin is of course the main character of this dish, which match very well with the asparagus and tofu.  It is very good.Leaf decoration is being place next to the dish signaling ""best wishes"" for the season.2. NimonowanThe soup with mixed crispy white fish and pumpkin and yuzu flower.  The extra slight sourness of the yuzu flower is the absolute highlight for this dish that makes the taste profound.  The different texture of fish and tofu enhance the overall experience of the soup. Very interesting and indeed thoughtful!   3. TsukuriTwo types of sashimi.  Otoro and snapper. Super fresh and perfect temperature served in home made soy source.  The Otoro can almost melts in your mouth.  The light grilled snapper is very tasty, a totally different taste and texture vs Otoro.  Very interesting sashimi combo.4. HassunAbsolute highlight of the whole meal.  (I feel so bad that we forget to take the detail photo of this dish).  It consists of two sets.  One being the Grilled Mackerel with sweet miso and babe onion.  This is absolutely delicious.  I have nothing else to say as the miso source is absolutely perfect for the grilled Mackerel.  The babe onion pickel on the side just provide a sour touch for you in between each bite of the fish.  Absolute thumbs up!The second portion is a mixed of different taste.  Another highlight is the water spinach which is very delicious and it is an eye opener for us of using tofu paste and sesame flavour mixed together.... the horse Mackerel sushi wrapped in oak leaf has a touch of raw oak leaf taste which make this sushi quite unique.  Lastly, the absolute delicious plum in jello (strongly suggest eat last) gives a perfect ending for this delicious dish.  We are frankly lost in words.5. ShokujiJapanese steamed rice with eggs and deep fried mackerel with homemade soy source with different variety of japanese pickels and. It is a perfect balanced with suttle flavour that matches well with miso soup.  6. MizumonoJapanese fruit with ultra sweet mango, kiwi, and pineapple.  Perfect ending for the wonderfull meal.Easily this is one of the very best Kaiseki lunch experience we have ever had in Hong Kong.  The whole lunch theme is filled with summer ingredient and deep green color presentation for all the dishes.   The food quality, the theme of ingredient, the timing and sequence of dishes, the presentation, the environment, the service, the set up, ... everything it is top notch.  HKD 680 per set is even a bargain in my opinion.  We are in particular lost in words for the grilled mackerel!  Unlike Chinese cuisine that maybe more flavour driven on each dish. Japanese Kaiseki is a whole dinning experience they want customer to experience, and Kashiwaya executed perfectly.  No wonder this is a 2 stars restaurant already just the first year opened in HK.  It is definitely 3 stars waiting now.Again, head chef Atsushi Takahashi came out to say goodbye to us when we left the restaurant, and we took a photo with him together.Highly recommended (if you have the budget)!000Sakizuke0SakizukeNimonowan0NimonowanTsukuri0TsukuriHassun (Sushi roll)0Hassun (Sushi roll)Hassun (Plum Jello)0Hassun (Plum Jello)Shokuji0ShokujiMizumono0Mizumono",Kashiwaya,4.6,750,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-kashiwaya/475194?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

Central,Japanese,", , , , ,, 3/10I've always been fairly curious about Armani/Aqua, primarily due to it's mysterious and cool looking front entrance. Unfortunately, having had lunch there, the front entrance remains to be the only impressive item.1The interior was fairly classy, as you would expect from a collaboration between Armani and Aqua. Much to my pleasant surprise, there was even a children playroom at one end of the restaurant. 0There was this new free flow brunch set with unlimited starters on offer at about $600. ($400 odd without alcohol). We chose the non-alcohoic version - big mistake as our tastes buds were able to fully engage in the taste of the food.The ""unlimited starters"" would end at 3:00 pm. It consisted of, amongst others, some not very fresh looking sushi and sashimi, similarly unfresh oysters and assorted seafood (shellfish and crabs), smoked salmon and salad. There were also parma ham, salami, and a pasta corner where you could order angel-hair or a mickey pizza. The food did not look appetizing to me at all. It was rather a rather depressing sight and I did not take anything from the starters. Those who had the sushi thought that the taste of the sauce was rather odd. The neta was not fresh. 1The hot starters from the Japanese corner were slightly better than the cold ones, even though I did not enjoy the onsen tamago with truffle. I had to ask for extra soy sauce before I could wash it down. The tempura prawns were not bad but nothing exceptional. Those were on the oily side. I did not try the piece of wagyu on offer as I do not eat beef. The others did not enjoy it.The stuffed chicken wings with mentaigo was really average stuff. Not what I would expect from an allegedly top notch Japanese/Italian restaurant. The polenta balls with cream cheese (?) were interesting but not particularly tasty.1The hot mains from the Japanese kitchen were also rather disappointing. The texture of the salmon, half cooked and half raw, was rather weird. The oily batter and what seemed to be tar tar sauce did not help. The foie gras were cold and bland. The wagyu patties (or hamburgers) were again very average stuff. Those who had the beef did not enjoy it.0At this stage, most of us were already completely demoralized and did not have the interest to carry on. The hot mains from the Italian kitchen fared a bit better. Most of the lamp racks were fine other than 1 or 2 pieces which did not taste well. The few pieces of paprika were probably the freshest item in the whole meal.At least the little one enjoyed the mickey pizza and the play room.1To be perfectly fair, the desserts were very good.1The cup of green tea, despite being contained in a stylish but highly user-unfriendly cup, was also not bad.0Service was very good.All in all, unless your primary purpose is to enjoy free-flowing drinks/desserts, I would steer clear away from this place.0",Armani / Aqua,nan,520,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-armani-aqua/61124?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

Central,Japanese,"We accidentally pump into this Japanese restaurant locates in Central after not able to get a seat for several restaurants earlier during the lunch time.  After a quick check on the openrice, we decided to give it a try as we are a bit tired already.  By the way, Xuan Sushi is a recommended restuarant by Michelin guide for several years.Locates on the third floor and with moden but yet contemporary setting.  With a bar table and around 10 plus tables, it is quite comfortable indeed.  Weekend lunch has 10 choices includes omaisaki sushi, sashimi, seafood rice , sukiyaki beef set, etc.  Me and honey after debate for a bit and we both decided to go for the deluxe seafood rice  (#3 on the menu) per their recommendation as waitress explains there are around 10 plus seafood assorted all together included ""Uni"".  Just too good to be true right?Boy, this seafood rice  is amazing!  Presentation is wonderfull and you can instantly sense the seafood is extremely fresh.  The orange colors uni, the salmon roe, toro, scallop, etc.  It just look amazing.  After mixing the soy with wasabi, I immediately tried out the horse mackerel, and it is so good and fresh.  With the perfect vinegar blend rice and body temperature serving, it has instantly become my flavor  ever!  Also, the rice includes a mixed of seaweed and pickel ginger that simulate our taste bud and texture.  The toro is also amazing, and it is almost the best toro I have ever had ... of course it is a bit exaggerated by me.  Haha.  The next up is the Amaebi (sweet shrimp), and it is flat out amazing.  Normally, Amaebi from any ordinary sushi restaurant will be a bit too soft but this one is really fresh!  Almost you can sense a bit of chewy texture, and it is absolutely delicious.  Uni is sweet and matches very well along with the salmon roe.  OMG.... We are pleasantly impressed!Lunch set of course comes with typical meso soup and steam egg.  Both the soup and steam egg is loaded with ingredients and flavour.  Very vood, but they are simply overshadowed by the amazing rice.You can have the choice of coffee/tea or ice cream.  HKD 330 plus service charge for ""seafood rice lunch set"" is a bit on the high side pricewise.  However, the quality is absolutely worth it.

Central,Japanese,"I came in for a late take-away lunch... it is rare to find take-away at a ramen restaurant. I ordered the mazesoba, which was very expensive for what it is (noodles and oil essentially).  By the time I made it to the office to eat, the noodles were already fused together and needed quite a bit of work to separate. The oil base is essentially soy sauce, with no life or kick, or anything to justify it's existence (or $105 price tag). The roast pork loin was good, but it takes a really poor chef to make bad pork loin... so that is no measure of a place's quality.Overall, this was a mediocre mazesoba and definitely not worth the amount of money they are charging.

Central,Japanese,"I am a repeated customer to this restaurant. Food was good and service has been ok and hence we decided to go back again today. Today is my 5th visit within the last 3 months.Reservation was made and so no waiting time at all. But restaurant was busy which is understandable since it's near Xmas.However, service was terrible. We sat down and ordered at 12:30. 4 set lunches with 2 additional orders of snacks. Snacks arrived fairly quickly. However, by 1:00 our set lunches were still missing. What upsetted us most was that a table behind us, who sat down almost 15mins after us, have their exact same set lunches arrived before ours. We asked the waitors if those were meant to be our order. The waitress came back first with an embarrassing look on her face and asked if she can offer us some other food first while our set lunches were being cooked. Then we asked again if they have sent the wrong order to the wrong table. A waitor then came to us and said the order was arranged by the cook and he didn't look at all sorry when he said that. We were like ""eh ? isn't your cook following orders took by you guys ? if he arranged the orders in such a way, does it mean you have missed our orders ?"" Then we hurried them to get our orders done without arguing more. But it would have made us feel better if they would at least apologise for missing our order. Anyway...Meals came in another 10mins. Food quality was like before but must say the ox-tongue was half the size in thickness as before (and I do have the same meal every time I go !!!)After our meals, we asked for the bill and asked for our ice-cream mochi. Guess what... they said they have run out of stock ! It really did make us wonder if a well established restaurant would not have ordered extra for busy period like Xmas (and mind you, we left at 1:30 with the restaurant still packed. So they must havecome short of 30-40 mochitoday)or if the waitors were upset with our complains and hence....All in all, not a very pleasant experienceespecially whenit meant to be celebrating Xmas.",Nan Tei,nan,150,nan,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-nan-tei/12439?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
Central,Japanese,"If you are a meat lover, this would be a place for you. But if you don't like meat that much, the food here may be a bit heavy for you. May be you can share 1 set with a friend as you have to order 200g of meat each time. A small bowl of salad, rice and daily soup would be provided for adding $30. But as you can order the exact amount of meat that you want, you know how much you are eating.Another tip would be do grab a high chair if you are wearing high heels. You will feel tired soon as part of the restaurants are walled with high tables only, you have to stand for the whole meal.

But a tip for the food is that do order 1 level lower than the level of how well you want the meat to be cooked. For example, if I like the steak which is med-ium-well, just order a steak in med-ium because the metal plates are extremely hot that will keep heating the meat while you are eating. Therefore, if you order a med-ium well steak, the second half of it would be ""well-done"" by the time you eat it. As said, not being a meat-love, I like the onions and corn on the side.

Central,Japanese,"0You really do need to stop and look at what's behind the curtain. For over twelve months I walked down Aberdeen Street in SoHo, wandering by a little yellow restaurant that had it's door partially obscured by a heavy curtain. Sure, I knew that it was a Japanese restaurant, the name gave it away. A little research may have piqued my interest much sooner, but the name of that little restaurant really meant nothing to me. Ippoh! Boy has that changed! It wasn't until a workmate, lets call her Zoe, wanted to help me celebrate my recent birthday with a special lunch time treat. She'd been telling me for a long time that her favourite Japanese restaurant in Hong Kong was Ippoh, and wanted to see if I agreed; so we made our way through Central to SoHo and our midday booking. It was a lightbulb moment for me. Finally the curtain was pulled back and we entered the tiny little tempura style restaurant, and seated at one of the eight spots available at the bar style dining room. All eight seats put diners right in the action where the Ippoh head chef (I never did get his name!) was busy preparing the tasty morsels that would be lightly tempura and fried right before out eyes. There were a couple of options for lunch, the YUKI course which consisted of eight pieces of tempura or the OMAKASE lunch, which was a much more comprehensive journey. No prizes for guessing which we chose. 0 Ippoh has been in Hong Kong for only a couple of years, opening in it's Aberdeen Street location in 2014, but there is a much longer and richer history to the little Japanese tempura restaurant. With a history that spans over a hundred years, the original Ippoh is located in Osaka and is one of the most respected tempura restaurants in Japan. The fact that our chef for the day was a fifth generation tempura chef spoke volumes about how seriously Ippoh is about presenting the very finest quality produce, where is imported fresh each morning from Tokyo's Tsukiji market. Very shortly after being seated, we were presented with all of the dining equipment that we'd need for our meal; I loved the seriousness and ceremony with which our setting was presented. As I played with the chopsticks, waiting for the meal to commence, our waitress complimented me on my technique. I have to say, I was pleased that she'd noticed and commented.... 0 0 A beautiful little bowl was first to arrive, filled not with tempura but a sliver of incredibly fresh halibut wrapped around spring vegetables and bathing in a pool of ponzu sauce. The simple freshness of the fish was sublime with the ponzu, which gave enough of a bite to perfectly balance the halibut. 1 It was almost mesmerising as we watched our chef prepare our tempura pieces, the first of which just about redefined my concept of fresh and delicious. A large prawn had been presented along with a green pepper, the tempura batter on each golden and almost translucent. Each was given an order and instructions about which accompaniment to use, the salt or the radish infused tempura sauce. 1 1 The first bite of my prawn left me dumbfounded. I'd had amazing produce before, many times in fact, but the light sweetness of the prawn, combined with the tempura and just a touch of salt was so incredibly well balanced that I was rendered speechless. I just closed my eyes and savoured the sweetness and the lightness. My second bite actually finished off the prawn and I was let saddened for a moment that it was gone. 0 I was apprehensive about the green pepper, I'm usually not a fan, but I needn't have worried, there was no bitterness or harshness from the pepper, it was just sweet and crunchy from the tempura. Chef watched us carefully as we ate each exquisite bite, informing us of the best way to devour the tempura, and often the careful backstory of each piece. Kisu, a variant of whiting from Japan was next, specially flown in from Japan that morning. It was ridiculously light and just as divine to eat as the prawn. Miatake mushroom followed, also known as hen-of-wood, the rich earthy flavour of the mushroom was particularly spectacular once shallow fried in the tempura. 1 I've never been a fan of sweet potato and once I learned that the golden wedge in placed in front of me was in fact sweet potato, I prepared myself for a distasteful experience. Again I was dumbfounded, the sweet potato tempura was delicious; I couldn't let it rest, and our chef explained that the sweet potato had been steamed for half an hour making it soft and luxurious. 0 Calamari was next, not a small thin strip like you'd see elsewhere, but a large chunk of squid that had the potential to be rubbery. But by now I had complete trust in the chef, and after a squeeze of lemon and a small dip in salt, the large piece of calamari easily yielded to my bite and, far from being chewy, was tender and sweet and oh-so-more(ish). 0 Understanding how delicious that first prawn was, chef provided us another prawn, this time wrapped in sisho. The slight bitterness of the sisho leaf was a superb contrast of that sweet prawn flesh, the bitterness not so overwhelming and again showing a deft hand by the chef. Probably the only tempura that I didn't enjoy was the eggplant, I guess even a fifth generation tempura chef with mad skills was not enough to overcome the fact that I hate eggplant! 0 I was amazed at the presentation of the uni, which had been wrapped in seaweed and tempura so perfectly that only the outside of the seaweed seemed to have been dipped in the tempura. The strong flavour of the uni was accompanied by a heavy dose of miso, which certainly packed a punch for my palate, but was still nicely balanced. 1 The tasty bites kept coming with Hokkaido scallop providing a lovely hit of sweetness. I'm a huge fan of scallops, the plump soft flesh especially wonderful with that light golden covering of tempura. 1 Sweet corn was next, a long flat section of the corn was presented and provided a new level of flavour, the corn beautiful and sweet, the tempura crunchy, the overall effect perfection. 1 Without doubt, the tempura from Ippoh was the best I'd ever encountered and if that was all I'd devoured on the day, I 'd have though the meal perfect. But, there were elements that were just too much for my western palate! A red miso soup came, presented in a lovely red container, but it was just too powerful for me, I didn't like the smell and the flavour was not to my liking. 0 A bowl of rice was topped with the Japanese version of bubble and squeak, leftover vegetables and some sweet fish. The tempura was nice, but I didn't really eat the rice. 0 It had been a huge meal, with almost too much to eat, I probably would have been happy without the last two dishes, feeling happy and sated just with the tempura. The meal finished simply with some Yuzu sorbet and Japanese plum grapes; simple and refreshing. 1 There was much to love about Ippoh, without doubt one of the best Japanese restaurants in Hong Kong; the tempura was second to none and watching our chef prepare and explain our course in an interactive way was wonderful. It's no wonder it can often take months to book a spot in one of the eight seats. It's a solid reminder that there are so many amazing places in Hong Kong that you can just so easily walk by and never know how close you've come to greatness. Ippoh continues the Japanese tradition of taking every day actions and taking them to an extreme art form. The humble tempura will never be the same, my expectations now at stratospheric levels. Thanks Zoe, for bringing me to your favourite Japanese restaurant! I will be back real soon to visit Ippoh again.

The place was totally empty on the upstairs / downstairs area, we decided to sit downstairs. The interior design is quite raw, music is pop music and very loud and the place was rather smokey.

When you pay this price for a steak you expect more than this.Last but not least, the front of house staff does not seem to be very customer oriented. When we arrived, all of them were looking at their phones and did not seem to care much about us.

Central,Japanese,"Quality sashimi;Funky decor;Pricey but good quality.Ronin:0It's common knowledge that the sashimi served over lunch are not as fresh as those served at night. That's the reason why I seldom order sushi or sashimi at new Japanese restaurants. But quite a number of Japanese friends have recommended Ronin so I decided to give it a go. 0I ordered their Assorted Sashimi Rice lunch set. It came after a short wait. It had scallops, hamachi, tai, ikura, prawns,salmon and tuna (Akami). Not bad for a lunch set:00 I have to confess that the presence of salmon worried me a little, especially when I'm paying $280 for this. It is relatively uncommon for a traditional/authentic Japanese restaurant to serve salmon sashimi. Most Japanese customers would complaint about it. Salmon is not very suitable for sashimi because of the risks of parasites. Some Japanese restaurants use salmon that had undergone a process of deep freezing to kill off parasites but it's still relatively uncommon. Fortunately, the general quality of the sashimi was good (including salmon). The scallops in particular were the most fresh. To my pleasant surprise, the akami, which is usually the acid test of the freshness of a restaurant's sashimi, was very decent too. The tai and prawns were decent too.Whether grated wasabi was used is another indication of the level of a Japanese restaurant. They used grated wasabi here. I appreciated the fact that sushi rice was used. The amount of vinegar was just right. I enjoyed my assorted seafood rice set. After having the red miso soup, steamed egg, seaweed and salad, the whole meal was filling enough for me.While some of my colleagues found the portion of their meal on the petite side in view of the price they were paying, they agreed that the quality of the food was good.000So the verdict is that the food quality was good and the restaurant did pay attention to details. I was happy with the meal even taking into account the price. A place worth bearing in mind if you are around the area. I might even try their dinner sometime.0",Ronin Japanese Cuisine,3.6,310,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-ronin-japanese-cuisine/470697?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
Central,Japanese,"Been to SAMA at Gough St many many times. One of the reasons is the close proximity to work, primarily of course, is the food.They offer a selection of hokkaido style soup curry with a good mix of toppings plus a standard set of vegetable. The highlight is one gets to choose the level of spiciness for the curry, ranging from 1 to 30. Personally, i like to ENJOY a meal so i tend to choose a milder taste. For those whom think they cannot handle the spiciness, stick to a number below 5. As the staff always say, if it ends up not hot enough you can always spice things up but you cannot reverse it.Customers can choose to have rice, ramen or udon to go with the curry (rice is standard, the noodles at an extra cost). Topping-wise, my personal favourite is the patty. Pan fried, not over-cooked and generally taste good (it's a patty, not an A-grade steak what else can one ask for). Pork is not recommended, the cut they use has way too much fat attached. Chicken and seafood are decent choices as well.SAMA is one of my favourite lunch places. I take friends there, challenge them to eat level 30, no one has fell for it so far...It is not situated at an eye catching spot, accommodates around 20 people.

Central,Japanese,"After hearing some good reviews about this restaurant, decided to pop in for lunch with a few friends. The interior primarily consists of a classic japanese wooden interior, with a majority of the floorspace dedicated to a large sushi counter. There is also a smaller room with a small sushi counter that seats maybe 5 people as well as 3 individual tables that seat 4. The spacing of the restaurant is very well designed. However, when I sat down on my table (the 4 seater), I noted that the table was still wet so had to notify the water to dry it. If i remember correctly, there are 6 sets to choose from (omakase, Hokkaido set, sushi set, deluxe sushi set...and 2 others). I opted for the Hokkaido set, which includes steamed egg, uni/salmon roe rice, 6 pieces of sushi and udon. The steamed egg was velvety and very smooth, with a small piece of mushroom inside, slightly seasoned for taste. However, the uni/salmon roe rice was relatively dissappointing as the salmon roe was not very fresh and didn't have the briny flavor you usually get from other comparable restaurants. The uni itself was ok but I expected it to be a better grade as it wasn't as smooth. The sushi was the biggest dissappointment in terms of freshness, with one of the pieces emitting a very strong fishy smell, which I did not expect from such a reputable establishment. The udon was average although slightly overcooked. The meal in itself was $500, and at this price, I will probably visit other similar establishments in the Central area for better grade sushi...at least during lunchtime.",SUSHI SASE,1.5,500,3,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-sushi-sase/47958?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

The sweet potato was in deed quite sweet and had an interesting mushy texture, the shiitake mushrooms had a good taste and texture, but was unfortunately almost cold, the peppers where three little slightly spicy peppers (similar to Spanish padrons) topped with bonito flakes- the best of the three skewers.Overall a satisfying and good value meal in an realized environment - will be back.Spicy beef rice bowl set$ 1280Spicy beef rice bowl set$ 128",Yakitori Bar,3.7,130,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-yakitori-bar/124768?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
Central,Japanese,"Funky Sumo restaurant.Probably better for drinks than for lunch.5/10  Unless you work (or drink) often in this area, it's very easy to miss this location. There used to be a nice lounge at the same location. It then folded and turned into a decent Japanese restaurant, which also folded and now became Amazake, which literally means sweet sake. It's a special type of sake usually served hot during festive seasons.Amazake has a funky interior with a comical sumo wrestler appearing throughout the shop. There is a prominent bar area set in the middle of the shop with partitioned seats and regular tables arranged around the bar counter.01There is a limited but sufficient amount of lunch sets to choose from:0I ordered a katsu don while my colleagues ordered tempura set , a seafood don and a negitoro don respectively.First came the salad (due to some techinal difficulties I couldn't upload that photo.) The salad was wholesome and tasty enough for set lunch standards. The amount of sesame sauce used was certainly generous. No complaints at all. That was relatively uneventful until we get to the miso soup and chawanmushi (steamed egg):While both the miso soup and the chawanmushi were decent enough (I would have preferred more dashi, i.e. fish stock, in the steamed egg as it was quite bland), what those lacked in quality they made it up by quantity. By that, I mean the restaurant does not appear to have a record of what the customers had. Most of the servers held a large tray with either miso soup or steamed egg. As they walked past each table, they will ask whether you had the soup or egg already before putting it on your table - which was normal, or just put it on your table if they can not see either of those on your table. 00In our case, we each received either an extra egg or miso soup. Being honest customers, we alerted them to the situation. Not that I'm really complaining about it.  After a rather long wait (and two more trays of miso soup and egg), my katsu don finally arrived:0The amount of egg sauce was good, it was neither too salty nor too soggy. The taste was just fine. The Japanese pearl rice was nice too. It was just the right texture.Unfortunately, the cutlet porkchops (tonkatsu) were a bit soggy.I suspect it's probably because my katsu don had been languishing somewhere on the servers counter before being brought to my table and not the fault of the kitchen staff. The management leave a lot to be desired.All in all, the katsudon was fine but HK$190 plus service is a bit steep.  Unfortunately, one of my colleagues was not satisfied with her tempura set. According to her, the tempura prawn was fairly bland and the batter was too soggy. 0  The colleague who had negitoro thought his was fine but I think the color of the negitoro is slightly too white for my liking. In my experience, it tends to indicate that it had been kept in the freezer for a bit too long. 0On the other hand, my other colleague enjoyed his amazake assorted sashimi bowl ($240).0  I asked for the dinner menu just for the sake of completeness. The items there seems far more interesting than the lunch sets here.

Central,Japanese,"Our entire team came here today for lunch. This is not my first time at Miso, but it is the first time I am having lunch here in at least two years. We were thirteen people in total and sat along a row of tables that were put together for us.The restaurant is located in the basement of the Jardine House building. The interior was simple and dimly lit, and the polished finish of our rustic, wooden table lends it a modern touch. At the heart of the restaurant is an open sushi kitchen bar and guests can sit around the bar and watch the chefs at work.The menu books were leather-covered and hot tea was served with what looked like authentic Japanese cast iron teapots (tetsubin). Lunch hours at any restaurant in Central are typically hectic no matter how cozy the same restaurants might be in the evening. With attendants being overstretched trying to rush from place to place, the ambiance was slightly chaotic. We often struggled to catch the attention of the waiting staff, but overall they were courteous and have worked hard to satisfy our needs.The menu presents a traditional selection of Japanese dishes. Although most of the items are in the raw fish, sushi or grilled seafood categories, they also serve beef and pork to cater to a wider audience. For lunch, the price range is around low 200s to mid-300s, although some of the shared lunch sets (for two) cost a little more if you want greater variety and less hassle in deciding what to have.As this place names itself Miso, I naturally went for the grilled miso-marinated cod ($215) that is otherwise also one of my favorite Japanese dishes. I ordered it separately  la carte, and paired it with a fresh salad with yuzu vinaigrette dressing ($78). Alternatively, you could have the grilled cod with sashimi (around eight slices of an assortment of three mid- to low-tier-priced raw fish), white rice and dark miso soup for a lunch set price of roughly $270.Most of my colleagues sitting near me went for the latter choice. The white rice glittered like shiny pearls under the warm lighting and they were small, round grains with a serving size that most of my female colleagues were able to finish.My salad came first and it was served in a very large bowl. Most of it was lettuce and frisee, but it also contained radicchio (red leaf chicory) and bright tangerine-orange cherry tomatoes that were exceptionally sweet. The leaves were fresh, and the dressing was refreshing and authentic.The miso-marinated cod was probably grilled on a teppan or a pan. There is some skill in preparing this dish, as the cod needs to be marinated in miso and sweet mirin one to two days in advance. A slight error with the proportions of the mirin and the miso could lead the fish to become irreversibly bitter, and the miso in the marinade could easily burn if it isnt removed from the cod before grilling. My grilled cod was cooked with perfect timing for a silky texture that is not overly dry. The flavor was just right with a subtle taste of miso, and the grilled fish was served with a big spoonful of daikon oroshi (grated radish) to offset the fattiness. In terms of portion size, this was also a generous helping compared to a lot of the restaurants I have been to.Our only complaint would be that they werent attentive enough to remember each of our orders and each time they came around with a dish it took us a while to figure out who ordered what. With such a chaos, it was only inevitable that one of us took the wrong lunch set. The waiting staff then informed us that it would take the kitchen another 45 minutes to redo the dish. In the end, my colleagues were forced to swap. The difference in time between the first and the last dishes served was also hugepossibly a half hour gap. Hopefully they would manage the logistics of a larger party size better in the future.",Miso,3.7,270,nan,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-miso/7678?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

The shrimp ramen wasn't any better.Having being a fan of dining in Japanese stalls, what I felt was most lacking is the passionate Japanese energy from the environment. Restaurant looks lifeless, staffs didn't seem to be enjoying what they're doing.

Soup came with the rice and the dish and it's normal / nothing special. I had the mackerel spike with Japanese rice. I find that the fish is nicely grilled and very appetiting to go with the rice. The dessert is the typical ice-cream filled glutinous rice cake found in most Japanese restaurant and a very good finish.

Central,Japanese,"Naked is pretty high up on the mid-levels escalator. I guess one of the reasons why it was pretty empty during lunch hour. The decor inside the restaurant also hinted that its more suitable for dinner as all walls where painted black and servers uniforms were also black. Only thing that could be considered bright or cheerful were the servers there.0They have a pretty focused lunch menu, 7 mains to choose from. For starters we had quinoa salad and scallop miso soup. Soup was standard; salad was fresh  crunchy veg with goji berries to give it the Asian flare and lots of quinoa to give texture. Unfortunately they used too much sesame dressing. It was too salty to eat the last few pieces of lettuce as they were soaked in the pool of dressing.1For mains, we had Mount Fuji and Naked Sashimi Donburi. Mount Fuji was prawn tempura sushi roll topped with a bed scallop sashimi and quinoa coated with mayo dressed in their lava sauce (hot sauce). Supposedly the more creative dish in the menu. I think the lunch chef forgot to put the kombu flakes and seaweed flakes as listed in the menu - we didnt see them when the dish arrived. They probably wouldnt have an impact on the taste anyway, only there for aesthetic reasons. The tempura prawn was soggy, probably made way in advance so they could be efficient with the lunch crowd. The roll was wrapped very loosely and fell apart as soon as your chopsticks touched it. The scallop and quinoa topping saved the otherwise very bland dish, yet you can tell the scallops were not fresh.Mount Fuji0Mount Fuji0Naked Sashimi Donburi was rather disappointing. You think they would put more effort in the dish if they put their name on it, but no. Uni was very appallingly pungent (you know, the unique smell/taste of stale uni). They gave us very generous portions of yellowtail tuna and big eye tail tuna but both lacks personality. Quinoa was very chewy and personally I didnt think it went well with the rest of the ingredients. Tried too hard to be a fusion dish, but failed.Sashimi don0Sashimi donThe sets came with tea or coffee. Two meals came to $271, we couldn't finish the donburi.

Central,Japanese,"Summer is coming and I am out of shape. I came here for a light lunch. I was going from IFC so I took the mid-levels escalator. Wasabi Warrior was on the same street as , the Chinese herbal tea shop. I got there at around 12:20pm, before the lunch crowd. The servers there walked me through their choices  they had sushi rolls to nigiri, to sashimi, and even hot Japanese rice bowls (teriyaki chicken or eel). As it was very hot that day, I opted for one sushi roll and three nigiri.As recommended by my friend, I had the Cooked Tuna and Avocado sushi roll ($19). I ordered the spicy version but they gave me the one without the seven-spice. It was still enjoyable, probably better than the spicy version. The tuna was dressed sufficiently with mayo, on top of it there was a slice (or two) of ripe mushy avocado, making the roll creamy and airy. Glad they gave me the non-spicy version as it felt refreshing and clean (in line with my original intent).Cooked tuna and avocado roll - Creamy fillings!$ 190Cooked tuna and avocado roll - Creamy fillings!$ 19I picked two types of nigiri out of the seven they offered that day: regular salmon, regular tuna, regular scallops, seared scallops, seared salmon with avocado, inari sushi with crab sticks and inari with seaweed. (1 for $12, 3 for $32, 6 for $52)Seared nigiri - Sushi rice packed too tightly$ 320Seared nigiri - Sushi rice packed too tightly$ 32Both seared nigiri were lightly charred with lines of mayo drizzled on top. I had two seared scallops nigiri, which was coated with a sweet sauce which tasted like teriyaki sauce, a bit foreign but it tasted good. The scallops were soft to the bite, which was a big contrast tothe rice below. The rice was packed way too tightly, one had to work the rice in the mouth for a bit before it disintegrate. Same goes for the seared salmon nigiri, salmon and avocado were always a good match, upped by the sweet sauce. But the rice was simply too packed. Maybe it was how the Aussies liked it (??).I didnt have the inari sushi but I had to mention them because OMG the inari sushi were gigantic! They were at least three inches long! They werent stingy with the crab stick/seaweed for the inaris either. I think it will be an excellenttummy filler.My lunch came to be $51 for four items, which was reasonable considering its location in Central (comparing to some upscale supermarkets where six pieces of salmon nirigi cost over $100).

One of the most gorgeous restaurant i have ever been in honestly. Everything was classy and neat. The brunch here is great especially Armani Aqua serves two countries of dishes. Italian and Japanese. Lets start off with Italian. When you first walk into Armani Aqua restaurant during brunch time, you can already see bunch of delicious Italian dishes. What i like to grab for Italian dishes are, Prawn And Mussel Platter, cause i love seafoods but except for the Fresh Oysters, reason why is because the oysters has too much sea water taste. For the rest that i like to grab from the Armani Aqua brunch Italian dishes is Octopus Carpaccio, Parma ham, smoked salmon, Italian platter and so on, they're all fresh. For the Japanese dishes that i like is Tofu bean curd, Udon noodles, of course Sushi and Maki and last but not least, Sashimi. They all taste fresh aswell. During brunch time they also have kids play room which is adorable. Its good that kids could play along than just sitting down. Kids can at least enjoy. But what i don't like is the table is too small. If im gonna add up some more food, the space isn't enough. So is with the Air conditioner. When its on, its too cold. But when its off, its too hot.

Central,Japanese,"This is a new restaurant in the Maxim's Group that has replaced one of our go-to restaurants in the Landmark, the Kiku. After a few months of renovations Kiku became Kikusan and we finally visited. It is no longer a top end restaurant like Kiku was but a Szechuan-meet-Japan quick-eat-casually place.We ordered quite a few dishes for the two of us: Dumplings in red oil - spicy and piquant as expected. Tastes quite good, especially considering the fact that it is not a full-fledged Szechuan restaurant but the dough wrapping can be thinner still. Pomelo salad - as stated on the menu, there is a spicy dressing, more like Thai (reminds me of Lian, another restaurant in the Maxims chain that closed quite a few years back). This dish is more invented / modified from a Thai flavour, it seems, than it is Chinese or Japanese. Very pleasant and refreshing. I will definitely order this when I return.Sushi platter - this was presented on a stand and has 12 pieces (I think). Fresh and tasty.Soft shell crab in rich paper roll - again, something like a Vietnamese variant. The crab was larger than the tiny ones often found in other outlets and crunchy. Pleasant enough and tasty.Spring rolls - Served piping hot and not overly greasy. Crisp and crunchy wrapping with tasty shrimp inside. Very good. Go for it when you visit.Dan dan noodles with katsu pork in layers - this was a huge let down. As the previous reviewer said the noodles are spicy, which is fine for me but the pork was tasteless, as it is layered, it is like eating a manila envelope. Not recommended.Eel on rice - as expected, not much to write about. Portion is not the full-size as was in old Kiku, nor is the price, therefore fair enough.Pork noodles - we ordered this as it was one of the star items on set menus with Kiku.

Central,Japanese,"I'd always prefer Tenmasa over Ippoh if I were to have tempura in Tokyo, but visiting Tenmasa where we are is a bit of a trouble having to travel all the way to Macau, so Ippph is first on the list when convenience is a call.We were lucky, got to be the fill-ins for a cancelled booking and were able to secure 2 precious seats for lunch. Otherwise would have to wait for 2 months to get the dinner booking we originally desired. I was told on the phone by the chef who usually confirms all bookings himself that the omakase menu for lunch is the the same as dinner so what the heck, we're in!With a capacity of only 8 seats around the tempura counter and a table for 4, serving just tempura, the food'd better be good. It IS good, well worth the wait and the price it charges.Setting - the place is small but lots of attention is paid to details like the beautifully engraved exhaust hood and the particularly arranged set of servingware on an Ippoh mat. Food - after the lettuce salad with dried seaweed and the onsen tamago served with mackerel soya jelly, we were set to net the freshest catch of the day straight from Tsukiji Market. We must have had 20 pieces of different kinds of seafood and vegetables, including different kinds of prawns, fishes, abalone, scallop, uni, squid, ginkgo, avocado, asparagus, maitake mushroom and more. All coated in an airy light batter that is briefly crunchy but juicy and tender inside. The chef delicately deep fried every single piece for each and every customer like performing an art, then carefully blotted off any extra oil and put on the netted plate in front of us and patiently explained what the piece was and how best to eat it, whether plain, with salt, with sauce or just a zest of lemon juice. Our meal should be finishing off with tempura prawn cake on rice in soup and dessert which was yuzu sorbet and fresh fruits, but in the end we were so full that we asked for the two to be skipped. However the chef insisted that we should try them because they are too good to be missed. We couldn't reject the enthusiastic chef and agreed to having just 1 rice in soup without the fritter and a dessert to be shared between the two of us. Both didn't let us down which brought our lunch at Ippoh to a complete and impressive ending.Service - typical Japanese courtesy and servicing etiquette that are greatly appreciated.

Then again, I am not a big fan. Even though it helps avoid a really thick and rubbery piece of pork, some people enjoy the satisfaction of chewing through a thick, JUICY piece of pork chop. The thin slithers of pork did not achieve the same effect. The batter was very well made and the skin was very crisp and moreish, but I think I prefer a pork chop. Don't get me wrong though - this dish is worth a try. Caution to those who can't take heat: the dandanmien (noodles) are pretty spicy!! The noodles came with a small dollop of peanut, onion and shallot mince, which, when mixed in well with the noodles, tasted pretty darn delish. Just a mouthful for me because I can't really eat spicy food.The dandan noodles were cooked al dente (yep I'm using this term to describe Chinese noodles), slightly chewier than expected, but it was fine! Thoroughly enjoyable - if only it were a tad less spicy. Maybe you could make the specific request when you order, the resto probably could accommodate!Conclusion:Although my overall rating of the food this time is a mere ""OK"", I will definitely be back! coz the takeaway hot lunch boxes look delicous.

Probably about 6 tables and a bar table on one end for single diners. Everything was nice and tidy.0They had a display of Hitachino Nest Beer. A Japanese beer my boyfriend was pretty excited about because it was his favorite Japanese beer.

This is for those that want to attempt their level 30 spiciness, they will take a photo of you and place it here. You don't have to finish the bowl. Just attempt it and you get your 15 minutes of fame.0Lunch menu was simple enough. You choose how spicy you wanted it, what soup base you want and then the meat. All curry come with vegetables, half an egg and rice. Add money for udon or ramen (which wasn't available when I was there).1Rice came in on a plate and was flattened. Portion size of the rice was extremely small. This was ok for me as I don't eat much rice, but not ok for boyfriend. But not to worry for those that can eat a whole rice cooker full of rice, rice refills are free.0Marathon Chicken ($88). I chose Marathon Chicken which was one chicken drumstick. My soup base was prawn and as I am a wuss in the spice department, I chose level 1. Yes, I'm a baby bear.   The chicken was moist and tender. Just fell off the bone. There was a generous portion of mixed vegetables that included lotus root, okra, carrot, eggplant, broccoli, cauliflower and aspargus. Half a hardboiled egg was also given to you. The curry soup was thin like a broth and very sweet and strong with prawn. I liked it. Level 1 was still bit spicy for me. Yeah ... I'm a wuss.0Hungry Bear ($128).

Central,Japanese,"This is a good Japanese restaurant but not the best. It does not pretend to be the best or to be haute cuisine, just good and reasonably priced considering it is in a prime location in Central.

The lettuce was fresh and crunchy, the crab stick and flying fish roe were as expected.

Central,Japanese,"This is a restaurant that we have been to dozens of times. Whilst it is supposed to be one of the best in town, I am afraid it is not so, in terms of food and even less in terms of service. It is certainly not bad but just not really that good.The restaurant is in the IFC, very near the Four Seasons and supposedly one of the nicest spots in Central. Of course people do pay high prices but they should not expect any less in return. Alas, this is where the problem lies. Due to its location and that there are not too many other options for high class Japanese food the restaurant is perennially full. The staff, whilst not rude, are no different from what you find in 2 or 3 star places when this is supposed to be a 5 star restaurant (not Michelin star but think hotels). Here, instead of the staff paying attention to you, you have to pay attention to them. You will not have anyone coming over until you spend some time and effort to flag someone down. You have to chase after your food. We were at the teppanyaki table and our neighbours were only given the set lunch menu and never realized that a la carte existed...We decided to go for teppanyaki this time and ordered a set lunch each plus a la carte for more food and variety. First off, the salads came, one a sashimi salad, one a plain one. Nothing to write home about. They were fine, just fine. Not presented in an appetizing manner or style.0We had abalone and beef for teppanyaki. Prices have gone up but portion sizes for abalone have steadily gone down over the past 2 years. Teppanyaki, especially at high end restaurants, should involve at least some grace and finesse, if not ceremony. There was none. We ordered different kinds of beef. No one bothered to even let us know which was which (the guests were supposed to figure out from tasting them? It so happened that even after asking and being told which was Australian and which was Japanese, we felt they tasted the same which was a shame). The food tasted fine over, but again, nothing special.0After a couple of small dishes, to finish the meal, one of us was supposed to have tempura cake (our favourite whenever we visit Japan) with udon noodles. This is ONE item, just that the tempura cake, in order not to be soggy, was to be served separately, from the noodles. Separate they really were. The tempura cake came out and the waitress plopped it in front of us. When the noodles did not appear, we chased, and chased, and chased. After 15 minutes came the noodles by which time of course the tempura cake had gone cold. Should this have happened at any restaurant? any nice restaurant, much less a top Japanese restaurant? Any self-respecting tempura place / chef would have been dismayed at this. Not at this place. No one batted an eyelid when we explained many times, to different staff, that the tempura cake but not the noodles. As for the quality of the tempura here which we have tried many times, do not expect standards like you see in Tokyo. It is one of the better places in HK. That's it. The batter is not thin or light like that in top restaurants in Tokyo In fairness, it is not ultra thick either.00For my starch, I chose teppanyaki fried rice. After I had finished it, the waitress presented a plate of pickles! For those of you not familiar with Japanese pickles, they are supposed to accompany rice. Here, it is like serving pickles after a guest has finished his burger or sandwich.0For dessert, the waitress plopped a small square piece of chocolate cake in front of each of us, adorned slightly with raspberries and half a strawberry plus a blurp of cream. As I noticed that for one lunch dessert was stated to be ""dessert"" but for another it was stated to be ""dessert sampler"" I asked the waitress how come there was no sampler. She was totally non - plussed and said that was the only dessert they had. Anyway, I let it drop.0This is not a bad restaurant, nor was a terrible meal. For a thousand a head for lunch, it ought to be quite a bit better, even in expensive HK.",Inagiku Japanese Restaurant,3.5,1000,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-inagiku-japanese-restaurant/17460?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
Central,Japanese,"it I walked past this restaurant, saw the lunch menu with one of the options on the list is Grilled Fish -seasonal ( ), I only wanted a simple lunch, so I walked in and asked the waitress what fish it would be for today, after she had consulted with the kitchen, she replied Seabream Fin (), so I said ok, and sat down and ordered that. When the fish came, I was stunned that it was a plate of six to seven pieces of fish in a very dark sauce with onions andsome mushrooms, I queried that it said GRILLED on the menu, the waitress replied that they grilled the fish first and then put sauce on to sautee!I tried, and it was obvious that the fish was fried and then mixed with heavy soy sauce. It was unbelievably salty, the ricewas just normal medium grain and hard, obviously not Japanese rice. In order not to waste the food, I really forced myself to eat it, but no joke, it was so salty that Icould only manageto have a couple of pieces and downed that with the rice in a flash moment, the saltiness made the miso soup tasted like plain water.I asked for the bill as soon as I finished the bowl of rice, and reflected to the waitress, obviously she could not do anything.I haven't written to Openrice for a long long time, but this lunch was so apalling that I just cannot resist not writing about it,my simple belief is thata so-called Japanese restaurantshould notserve theirfood of such poor standard.I only realized when I checked in here that there were already two reviews about how bad this restaurant is.AVOID this joint.",Toyo,1.2,130,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-toyo/189437?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

Central,Japanese,"Needed a quick lunch at Exchange Square so decided to sit down at Agehan. The waitresses sat us down quickly and the place was clean.The two of us ordered a tempura on rice (5 prawns, a bit of fish and a variety of vegetables) and a udon and tempura (2 prawns and a variety of fish) which stangely also came with a couple of plain sushi rolls. The udon noodles were fine, nothing spectacular. The tempura was freshly made and hot which was good. Batter was not the thinest or even very thin (but then cannot expect Tokyo top-class quality here). Not the thick and plasticky variety either. So I would say it is fine especially for a quick lunch of 30 minutes. What was strange was that it came with two sushi rolls which had no topping or filling. Wonder why?The tempura on rice was pretty good too. Again, tempura freshly made and I feel that the rice was better value, with 5 prawns (cost just a bit more than the udon) and it made for a filling meal.Both came with the usual yellow radish slices which was pretty standard. There was also a small serving of dark seaweed with the rice which was far too salty.Guests were offered coffee at the end of the meal.

It is a chicken based broth with soy flavouring. It is fairly unusual to get this kind of ramen. It was salty and tasty. The noodles were firm and thin (like hakata-style) and had a good al dente chew to them.  The negi ramen was full of spring onions and came with both halves of an egg and bamboo shoots.

As a normal dining place for an easy and light lunch in a decent price in Central, it is a good choice.The free Japanese starter is always a delicious dish. The salted seaweed is quite tasty and the dish tastes very similar to instant noodle. Well, to me, I prefer sour and sweet starter, like something similar to marinated ginger slice 44My friend loves fresh Sashimi Salad very much, but I think the appearance is not attractive enough and the salmon tastes over-soft. Salad is not bad, especially the slightly sour sauce, which caters this season very well. My choice is Ramen, and a mixed of cold and warm style (Tsukemen Ramen - Japanese dipping Ramen) with a good presentation. The soup is a mixture of Miso and Tonkotsu (pork bone), but not warm enough and a little too salty. To be tough, Ramen is not elastic enough while as it turns cold it is really strong in texture. The pork is just too rough. I love the spring egg (Onsen Tomago) very much, because they use Japanese sweet soy sauce to make it.2Deep Fried Oyster, needs time to be prepared by chef, but it turns out really good, especially the fried flour skin. I don't think the fried oil is some kind of superior brand or imported stuff, while I appreciate the skill of chef, who makes the flour skin fluffy and crispy in mouth, and even performs better than oyster itself.Overall, it is an ideal place for business lunch or weekend quick meal, cozy environment and good service. Not expensive as Central's consuming level, and I will recommend the fries for sure.",Yachiyo Ramen,3.3,135,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-yachiyo-ramen/19327?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

Central,Japanese,"Ramen ! I need Ramen after staying long in the cold office! At the busy lunch time, it's much more crazy crowded in Central. By chance, I 'm getting in it without queue and believed that it should be fine as many people inside. hahahaThere are many different types of soup for ramen. I chose the highly recommended one - crab soup one. Personally, I feel crab is fishy smell and taste odd if soup. But what the sudden thought to push me to order this one!Well, it comes to my front. Smell is good and not fishy. After 1 sip, it is rich and tasty.The portion of soup and ramen is well balanced - can 1 sip with 1 bundle of ramen.The pork is fair and ramen is cooked as your fave. But I feel disappointed on the egg. Egg is overcooked which make feel bad with soup. For me, egg is one of main character in the ramen.Service is so so. Tea is not served frequently.

Central,Japanese,"I saw the reviews on this little jap diner and was so attracted by the lunch set menu so I came to give it a go There were two of us and we ordered a 3-item-set each. Here are some photos:0First item: The sashimi rice was made up of salmon and hamachi pieces. The proportion of sashimi and rice are just right. The sashimi was of decent quality considering the price, but obviously didn't impress particularly.As each of us gets 3 items, it's enough for a petite girl like me. However 3 of these added up might not be enough to fill up a bigger guy's stomach.0Second item: scallop sashimi with homemade(?) spicy sauce on riceI was looking forward to this a lot, however the sauce just simply didn't deliver. It was too strong, and its acidity was too overwhelming to bring out the freshness and sweetness of the scallops. The two didn't go well tgt. However the portion was satisfying and the scallops were of decent quality.0Third item:This was definitely the best out of the 6 we ordered. The salmon were grilled perfectly on the surface and the inside remain only half cooked, giving the fish a nice char-grilled taste while keeping the texture soft. It goes really well with the rice and they served generous portions of the salmon. 0Fourth item:Unagi on riceThis was pretty good too and the sauce was lovely. But there were only 2 small pieces and I wanted more. Enough said.Fifth item: fried shrimp rollsThese were just ordinary and unseasoned, hence lacked flavour. I'd have preferred those form Genki.Sixth item: chicken teriyakiThese were good and they gave us chicken thighs which were succulent and tender. The flavour was what you'd expect of chicken teryaki. Generally happy with this dish.They also served miso soup and a scoop of ice cream which are included in the set. Both were satisfactory. The sesame ice cream I ordered was a delight, while the green tea ice cream was a disappointment so I wouldn't recommend it.The space was tiny and could hold 10-12 ppl at most so it's not a place where you'd stay for too long. Each set costs HKD$100.00 with no service charge required. This is a better deal than anyone could ask for a jap lunch in central district, considering the quality!Conclusion: If you're looking for high quality stuff, this isn't the place to go. however, it's a SUPER GOOD DEAL and is a place to consider when you feel like trying out tons of different stuff all in one set at pa low price.",Ozawa Japanese Restaurant,3.1,100,10,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-ozawa-japanese-restaurant/57169?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
Central,Japanese,"Read about this restaurant and its healthy ramen from the media when it first opened, but could never find it until I accidentally bumped into it when passing by the market stalls at the end of Stanley Street (despite the address being on Wellington). The place looked like a cross between a traditional Japanese ramen house and an izakaya. The menu featured mainly ramen items but there were signs posted on the wall featuring various izakaya food items. Decided to try the healthy ramen - they come as a set with 3 choices of ramen - I went for the ""Beauty"" set. The set came with a small salad and a bottle of yakult, which was interesting. The salad was served too cold, although the yuzu salad dressing was quite nice. When my bowl of ramen arrived, was a bit disappointed to see the lack of toppings (just a few slices of green leaves and bacon bits) compared with the picture on the menu. The soup tasted quite unique - salty and yet citrusy. The noodles were chewy but didn't seem freshly made. It wasn't till I almost finished the whole bowl that I noticed the red ginger and spicy raddish toppings on the table. Took some to try but found them too preserved, and the raddish was super spicy.0Beauty1BeautySupplementary InformationWill probably come back to try the izakaya dishes next time.",Kenko Syokuhin Ramen,nan,80,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-kenko-syokuhin-ramen/135098?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

I didn't like much the dessert, the milk was too strong to my taste, it covered all other flavors. I will definitely come back for lunch. However, I might not want to try that $1280 omakase dinner menu. I did the maths, if I order sake, it'd be around $2000 per head at least. And the $880 dinner menu didn't seem to be enough for a Friday night for example. The environment was very cozy but it wouldn't give me that urge to spend that much. For that money, I could have many choices.In general, food was really good but hard to keep me as a regular.

Plain decor with about 10 chairs available for sitting. Hygiene was okay.0Service:The dude at the counter was friendly and told me about the combos they had. However, the phone rang right when he sat a box of food down on the counter without saying anything, so I just assumed that it was mine and hoped that I didn't take someone else's. I felt he could have said something.Taste & Value:I love softshell crab, so it wasn't hard for me to choose a roll at all.I chose ""Spy-Da"" ($26), which had softshell crab, cucumbers, and shredded crabmeat. Everything about this roll was fresh, which was good. However, the softshell crab was quite small and not crispy enough. It was dusted with some spices giving it a very non oriental taste.

Central,Japanese,"After two months I finally have a friend from Vancouver in town!  Long before I came back Ive already heard her talk about how she loves going to Sen-yro whenever shes back in HK so naturally this is where we decided to meet for our first lunch.We were at the IFC location on Saturday afternoon and there were 38 tables ahead of us!!! =0= Good thing they have those ticket machines where you can enter your phone number and theyll call you when youre 10 tables away. We got something to drink and walked around the mall for around half an hour before we were called back.The place is fairly small so I can see why we had to wait that long for a table.On each table you can find the standard pickled ginger and matcha powder (although on the non-conveyer belt tables youd have to ask the waiters to refill your cup with hot water anyway which kind of defeats the purpose, but anyway) and the best of all, freshly grated wasabi!!Wasabi0WasabiSince I eat cheap sushi most of the time (lol) and I dont always encounter fresh wasabi so this got me really excited! It tasted saltier than regular wasabi and there were some nut-like pieces in it too. Actually, my friend said it probably wasnt wasabi since it was too pungent  probably some sort of horseradish. Nevertheless I thought it was really good and I couldnt stop eating it To start I ordered tamagoTamago0Tamago-It was served warm but since this was the first dish served, and being the polite & courteous friend that I am ;) I waited for my friend to return from the bathroom before eating it so it was cold by thentoo bad!-Anyhow I thought it looked a bit dry at first it actually wasnt too bad. The texture is kind of bean-curd-like, similar to the one at The Mon but the taste is so much better. It was eggy and not too sweet.Next came the nigiri that I ordered  Hamachi, Otoro, Extra Large Scallop and Ika Noodles with Yuzu PepperHamachi, Otoro, Scallop, Ika with Yuzu Pepper1Hamachi, Otoro, Scallop, Ika with Yuzu PepperHamachi, Otoro, Scallop, Ika with Yuzu Pepper0Hamachi, Otoro, Scallop, Ika with Yuzu Pepper-Hamachi & Otoro  both of these were disappointing espeically the otoro. They werent fresh and tasted metallic & fishy. I saved the otoro for last so that it could reach room temperature but even then there was no oily surface that Id hoped to see.-The Extra Large Scallop was nice! Actually, this was the reason why my friend even wanted to come in the first place. They give you a fairly large piece of scallop, sliced in half and fanned out over the rice. The taste is decent as its fairly sweet, but really, we only ordered this so that we could sink our teeth into a huge piece of scallop which is one of the most satisfying feelings you can ever get omnomnom-The sliced ika noodles was interesting, mostly because of the yuzu pepper. Both were tasty on its own but Im not sure if they necessarily compliment each otherOur second platter was less interesting  Aburi Salmon, another piece of the scallop and red clam sashimi (thats what I think it is).Aburi Salmon, Scallop, Red Clam0Aburi Salmon, Scallop, Red Clam-Aburi Sashimi  Im glad I ordered this rather than the regular one. I saw the regular ones on other tables and it looked like low-quality farm salmon. Granted, it was the cheapest thing on the menu but I would have expected a teensy bit more from Sen-ryo. Anyhow, aburi-ing the salmon did help make it taste better texture wise and I loved eating it with lots of yummy wasabi ^_^-Red Clam Scallop  nothing too special about this. It was like a slimier geoduck sashimi but not as sweet. I wouldnt order this next time.One thing to note is that the service here was good. The dishes were served fairly quickly and the staff was polite and helpful.Our total turned out to be around $280 which is rather expensive considering we didnt actually order that much food.

There was no such option at this place.- Pork was insubstantial for the size of the noodles.

Central,Japanese,"Having been to Sushi Iwa in Tokyo, we were ecstatic to learn that they have opened up a branch in Hong Kong! Located in the Asia Pacific Center, the elevator will only take you up to the 29/F where its sister teppanyaki restaurant Ginza Iwa Sumibi is at with another flight of stairs for Ginza Iwa specifically. Our friend had made the booking for lunch and I didn't realized that she had booked a table at Ginza Iwa Sumibi instead of Ginza Iwa until I arrived. Due to our party size of 5, my guess was that it was easier to get a table at Sumibi than the limited counter seats at Ginza Iwa. However, I was informed by the staff at Sumibi that we can still order sushi from Ginza Iwa, and the only difference would be that the sushi will not be made in front of us and handed to us one by one. Okay that was fine with us!0The lunch menu at Ginza Iwa had 3 options: Haruat $450, Akiat $800, and Omakaseat $1250. The prices were pretty expensive especially since the omakase for lunch in Tokyo only cost 10,000. I ended up ordering the Haru while J got the Aki.Our lunch sets also came with salad and daikon with beef stew. The salad was average with the standard sesame salad sauce.0The stew was rather interesting with its chewy texture but while the container was super hot, unfortunately the content was not.0After our appetizers, we had to wait quite a while before our sushi finally arrived.The Haru came with 8 pieces of sushi and 4 rolls. The Akami was rather bland while I liked the chewy texture of the Kinmedai. The Aji was interesting with a negi paste on top. The Kohada tasted a bit similar to saba. All the pieces tasted alright but nothing to write home about. The only piece that really stood out was the hotate because it was different as it had been marinated with yuzu. It was intriguing but just not sure if the combination worked for me.010000The Aki came with 12 pieces of sushi and 4 rolls as well. I think the bulk of the sushi was quite similar to Haru but had more higher value items like toro, uni, shrimp, etc. Again, most of the sushi were just average in flavor.The uni was really salty for some reason - as if someone had put salt on it.00The kanpyo rollwhich was made up of simmered gourd was sweet and light to eat.0The dessert we received was warabi mochi, which was perfectly chewy and not too sweet.0Overall, we were very disappointed with the sushi at Ginza Iwa. It actually looked pretty good at first glance, but after eating a couple pieces, we all looked at each other with a perplexed look like 'this is it?' I mean it wasn't bad, but for the price, I was expecting much higher quality and more flavors. Most of the pieces weren't that impressive, let alone memorable. Even the rice was not warm which is what one comes to expect from quality sushi restaurants.I'm still trying to figure out what went wrong. How could our experiences be so different from others? Was it simply because we were not sitting at the sushi counter? If so, then their sister restaurant should not have allowed us to order from Ginza Iwa if they cannot ensure the quality of their food. We felt gypped because the quality of the sushi we got was on par with Fukusuke and yet we were charged double / triple the price.",GINZA IWA,2.7,700,nan,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-ginza-iwa/149641?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

The black sauce was actually nori mixed with negi. The shiso also tasted pretty good . - 0 - Ikura: Usually Ikura (salmon roes) are marinated in shoyu. These weren't, as a result, you could really taste the freshness of the Ikura. Very good. - ...0 - ...As a general observation, the type of rice used was koshihiraki , a top grade rice from Japan. It's rounder and harder than usual. The vinegar taste was light.  Pausing here, another point about the service,the chef held the sushis tighter after seeing me use chopsticks!

Grilled anago: It did not have any annoying soil taste and was quite crunchy.  - , 0 - , Uni : I'm not entirely sure where this sea urchin came from. Anyway it was very creamy. Don't over do the shoyu.Anago with tare: This was fine. Not spectacular but fresh (I.e without the annoying soil taste.) The egg was fluffy and sweet. Good. - 1 - 0Negitoro: This was the first time that we see negitoro made in this style. It's a negitoro roll wrapped in a big piece of nori and made into a parcel instead of being chopped into smaller portions. Some carbs to round off the lunch was much appreciated. - ...0 - ...Conclusion:All in all, the quality of the seafood here was definitely above average with many original ideas displayed.

Since the name is RICH broth, so I was expecting the taste to be a bit more intense, however it was quite diluted. Space for improvements. Also, was there a special purpose for the orange peel?

Central,Japanese,"SO, I Went to Have lunch with my wife in Central the other day~ to this ramen place in Central. Nice clean small noodle shop, Well, it is a ramen shop~ what do you expect~ they are basically a Fast food place. The waiter to customer ratio was about 22 customers to 4 floor persons, 3 kitchen guys.Just like Rolls Royce engines.  it is adequateNOW look at the price. About 60- 80 a bowl. But bad.The topping are ranging 8  15 dollars, and the Snacks are about 18- 35 HKD.HOW about Drinks you say? Well, 12 for Oolong tea and 65 for a REAL SAKE. We Had Water. ( Well, It is a noodle Bar, NOT a real bar. )Still I think is Fair priced.I have to say, my photos were not professionally done and they dont do justice for the food.Couple things,1) The Tofu with Semi Cooked Egg was great! Very good on visual too. AND It is actually Sweet Bean Sauce and Sesame sauce with some Sesame on top~ You know the ones you put on Stinky tofu? Thats EXACTLY that~ It goes together well, and, Of course they are higher grade stuff, but the whole time, I was thinking  If there were some MISO with the Tofu If there is some Miso now It might work.2) The dumplings are FAIR. It took some time for them to cook ( about 20 mins ) they are not the garlicky taste like the ones I am used too. Just NORMAL dumplings.3) The Noodles, I ordered the pork+ fish stock mega noodle and my wife ordered the Pork stock XXX mountain thing.Pork + Fish stock is relatively light and I like the taste of it. NOT SALTY and NOT overly Spiced. NOT REFREASHING thou, but I think it is a good balance which I can eat .. well, 2-3 times a week. ( Some shops you could only have once a month cos too oily and Savory) , and The Char Siu is a bit rough , but I can live with it.My Wifes Raman is a mountain, a mountain of noodles and onions and Vegi. The Stock got some porky taste to it ( Well, the other post mentioned it too) BUT IT IS NOT AS BAD as they said. Just take some pepper and it would take the soup to another level, and make you happy.It is just a comfortable meal. It is very hard to find a Raman shop these days. Something thats not over kill in taste ~The noodles are one of those pre seasoned oil yellow noodles, thicker and usually use for thick heavy stocks. Best part is that I dont need to Run to 7-11 to buy a stick of gum to kick the after taste out of my mouth. It is something Me and My wife can live with.NOW I Really think this shop is operated by a someone who appreciate food with a lighter taste. These days a lot of shops are FILLING the menu with Pork stock thats SO heavy and thick you could glue wallpapers with them. And Really, why would you need something that Savory all the time?With all the food we ate.~280 HK for 2 person. Costly? Well, Not really in Central area. Cheap? Not really for my cheap lunch standard~Would I come here again? Yes~ and the waiting time is not bad~Daifukuya Rich Broth original ~  - My order~ Pretty good!

I go to sleep looking forward to waking up for meals and I get excited planning to try out new restaurants with my friends and family. Scrolling through my Instagram feed makes me drool (yes, I follow a lot of foodies), and pretty much all the photos I take are of food. I am not even kidding. My entire Instagram feed, my digital camera, my iPhoto albums are filled...seriously, I'm addicted.Anyways, I have decided to start sharing photos of food I'm eating so that more people can go and enjoy good food too!This first post will be about Ginza Iwa ! It is an outlet of the 1 Michelin Star restaurant back in Tokyo, run by head chef Daisuke Suzuki (an apprentice of Iwa-san for over 8 years). Located on the 30/F of Asia Pacific Centre on Wyndam Street, its right above its sister restaurant Ginza Iwa Sumibi, which mainly serves teppanyaki. However, in order to get to the restaurant you have to take the elevator to the 29/F, where the staff will then take you upstairs. (I could only insert 8 pictures, but the rest is on my blog - http://maxinechann.blogspot.ca/2014/01/ginza-iwa.html)The interior of the restaurant is bright and minimalistic, nothing overly fancy, but I liked the use of wood since it was pretty relaxing.Seating Area0Seating AreaBoth times I came here were during lunch; The first time was with my two highschool friends. Because one friend only eats salmon and tamago, we phoned in advance to tell them. They proceeded to tell us that they could accomodate her needs which was very nice of them. My other friend and I decided to get the Haru Set Lunch (), which was $450 and included salad, 8 pieces of sushi, 1 roll, miso soup, steamed egg and dessert.I was super excited because I saw a lot of instagram pictures, and the food looked incredible.The first thing that came was the salad. Just simple greens with wakame, sesame seeds doused in a dressing that tasted like soy sauce but a little more tangy.Salmon Tamago Don0Salmon Tamago DonThis was what the don that they prepared for my friend! I think she paid around $230 for this, which I find is a really good deal. Also, I liked how they included a variety of items and not just pieces of salmon. It had ikura, finely minced salmon toro with negi (in the middle), salmon sashimi, seared salmon as well as finally chunks of tamago.I tried a little bit of hers and it was really good. The different textures really transformed an otherwise ordinary ""salmon tamago don"" into something completely moreish. My friend loved it as well and polished everything in the bowl.I love how clean the table is, everything is so neat! We were just waiting for our food. Although they give you a plate of soy sauce, all the sushi already comes with nikiri (blend of soy sauce) brushed on top, so unless you really enjoy salty food, I would recommend eating the sushi on its own (you can taste the fish better that way too!)Our first piece was hamachi/yellowtail. This was mild and refreshing and you could tell the fish is super fresh. The flesh was nice and chewy and firm. The fish to shari (rice) ratio was also perfect. The rice had more vinegar than the other types of sushi I've had, but I didn't mind and actually enjoyed it.It was followed by kinmedai. I don't have this type of fish often but I really liked this. This fish is also more on the lean side, but had a really nice crisp and firm texture.Akami0AkamiWhen we were eating our first piece of sushi, Chef Suzuki already started marinating this piece of akami in soy sauce. Before serving, he took it out of the sauce and patted it down with a paper towel. I love how every piece of fish was so fresh, it was truly amazing. Comparatively, the red tuna was softer and took less effort to chew.I did find this a little bit salty though, but my palate is quite sensitive to salty/sweet foods, even when other people find things okay, I tend to find them overly salty/sweet (I'm quite used to bland food!!). To be honest, even the other pieces were also a little too salty for my liking, but thats okay.Ika0IkaNext up was ika. It was served with a touch of salt on top. I remember my dad first got me to try squid by telling me it was like chewing gum. The texture of this blew my mind. It was clean but at the same time sooo chewy. Probably one of my favorite pieces.Kohada (Gizzard Shad)1Kohada (Gizzard Shad)This was my first time trying kohada...it was good! Taste-wise it reminded me a bit of saba, but at the same time it doesn't really taste like saba haha. Its hard to describe.Aji1AjiOmg, looking at this makes me crave it again. This was Aji/Horse Mackerel. The dark blob on top was negi, and boy, this was my favorite of the bunch. The flesh was firm and was just super flavorful. When my friend and I ate this, we just stared at each other in silence...it was that good.The waitress then brought out our steamed egg/chawanmushi. It was silky smooth, and had pieces of crab, mushroom, chicken in it.Our next piece was ikura, each roe was plump and separated from one another. They simply burst in your mouth like a popping wonderland upon the slightest pressure from your tongue!!Anago0AnagoI have never really appreciated anago much, and usually prefer unagi. However, the anago here really makes me think twice...it was buttery, fatty and fell apart so effortlessly...again another amazing piece.Akami, Kanpyo, Cucumber, Negitoro Roll0Akami, Kanpyo, Cucumber, Negitoro RollBecause two people beside us were also having sushi, Chef Suzuki made us 4 different rolls. From left to right it was akami, kanpyo, cucumber and negitoro. My favorites were the kanpyo and the negitoro.We were then served dessert: my friends got the black sesame ice cream, but because I can't eat cold stuff, I asked if they could give me something else. My friends said the ice cream was good, but nothing mind blowing.I was served some type of mochi made with some type of leaf and dusted with soybean powder. This was sticky and not too sweet, not bad.We were all full at this point, but not to the point where we had to unzip our pants and go into a food coma afterwards. It was a nicely portioned.Because the people next to us got toro and uni (which looked really good), I came here less than 2 weeks later with my dad to try out the Aki Set Lunch (). This was more expensive, at $800. It included salad, 12 pieces of sushi, 1 roll, miso soup and dessert. For some reason, my dad and I only got 11 pieces?? Not sure....hm...(some pieces are the same as the ones from my last visit!)The first piece was kinmedai, then hamachi, akami.The piece of ika was different from the one I had last time, but even better. It was super chewy and lets just say I really really enjoyed it.Next we had chu-toro. This was super fatty, and the fish oil just coated my tastebuds...they sure were happy campers!Aji again. Still so good.This next piece was baby white shrimp. The flesh was sweet and slightly sticky like amaebi. Sooo fresh!My dad and I first thought that this piece of hotate was cooked...and so I wasn't extremely excited. But it wasn't, probably just marinated. This was super sweet and tasty too.Can't say no to ikura again.Next up was uni  My dad and I were just transported to uni heaven for a little bit there.Anago again, love love love it.Kanpyo rollSo happy I got to try the tamago here. This wasn't like the typical egg at other restaurants; it reminded me more of a sweet egg custard, kind of like a pre-dessert. I really enjoyed it though. I want more of it right now.Anyways, I really enjoyed both my trips to Ginza Iwa (although I am still confused about where my 12th piece of sushi went). Both times I requested to be served by Chef Suzuki, but he doesn't really speak english or cantonese so if you wanted to talk to your chef about the food or what not, you should probably go with the local chefs. If I were to pick one lunch set though, I would choose Haru. The pieces of sushi served weren't that much different, but the price is pretty much double.I would definitely come back again in the future though.",GINZA IWA,4.2,500,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-ginza-iwa/149641?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

Central,Japanese," Gyotaku Set Lunch Lunch HourGyo-taku) Set Lunch Menu Baked Marinated Salmon ($130)Set LunchC150 200Retooling the Japanese cuisine for busy week-day lunch hour is hardly a new idea. The word ""Gyo-taku"" originally means a traditional method of Japanese fish printing and while Gyotaku may not display all the sparkle and creativity of this historical innovative way of recording different kinds of fish, the restaurant counters with a surprising willingness to explore the rich variety of Japanese dishes. Ever since working in Central, Gyotaku has been C's favourite lunch spot.0Located on the 12th Floor of the thin building on Stanley Street, the decor of Gyotaku is sleek, yet utterly cosy. Comfortable lighting, simple colours and wooden furniture imbue the space with a casual and modern feeling. The restaurant is usually very fully booked during lunch hour almost every day, so we had to book a table at least 2 days in advance. Service is polite and attentive. Gyotaku serves a special daily set lunch menu that changes every day and also its more pricier lunch menu. What amazed us was its wide variety- from sashimi set to sukiyaki set, it really included almost every items you could imagine from a Japanese restaurant! A lunch set comes with a salad and a miso soup. Lunch is reasonably priced at $150 to $200 per person.1(1) The Baked Marinated Salmon ($130) is C's favourite and is the must-have dish every time he visits. The salmon was extravagantly tender and succulent, and was baked in an alluring way to bring out the vibrant and intense flavours of the fish with a hint of spiciness. The mayonnaise further lifted the enticing taste of the dish. It was an outstanding dish that is highly recommended for everyone who is a fan of salmon.Baked Marinated Salmon ($130)1Baked Marinated Salmon ($130)Baked Marinated Salmon ($130)1Baked Marinated Salmon ($130)(2) San ordered the Grilled Miso Cod Fish Set ($150) and it was another accomplished dish. The cod fish was wonderfully grilled. Each piece of fish was adoringly soft and tender, and delicately moist to keep its surface shiny. San found the dish to be very enjoyable.Grilled Miso Cod Fish Set ($150)1Grilled Miso Cod Fish Set ($150)(3) Everyone seemed to like the Marinated Pork in Ginger Sauce ($108 Set Lunch Price) including Chow Chow. The pork had a gorgeously firm and bouncy texture. The soy-sauce-based marinate was sweet and decadent, but it was hard to find the ginger taste in the dish.Marinated Pork in Ginger Sauce ($108 Set Lunch Price)...0Marinated Pork in Ginger Sauce ($108 Set Lunch Price)...(4) The 3 Type Sashimi on Rice ($118 Set Lunch Price) was a bowl of joy. The 3 types of sashimi varied based on the availability of the day. That day we had Salmon, Tuna and Scallop. The raw fish were all very fresh and tasty and the flavours were well balanced. We just hoped that they could be more generous with the portion of each slice of the sashimi.3 Type Sashimi on Rice ($118 Set Lunch Price)13 Type Sashimi on Rice ($118 Set Lunch Price)(5) Lastly, the dessert, Sesame Pudding was a real showstopper! It only came with the normal lunch set menu. The medley of sesame mixed with the soft, chewy pudding texture formed a symphony of tastes in the mouth that was utterly the perfect and unforgettable end to our lunch.Sesame Pudding0Sesame PuddingGyotaku presents the Japanese cuisine with confident, fluid grace and these dishes, coupled with a brace of insightful cookery skills lend the restaurant a warm and comfortable ambience, offering a satisfying lunch that would lighten up the timeworn elements of your boring work days in Central.",Gyotaku,nan,170,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-gyotaku/49901?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
Central,Japanese,"Surprisingly no queue at lunch hour this time! Saw their special menu which offers the Gyokai Ramen which is a fish based soup. Decided to give it a try. The first taste of the soup was ok - slightly sweet but not too much of the fish flavour I was expecting. They used a different kind of noodles which was nice and chewy, and pork slices were tender as usual. Apart from two slices of pork, there were only a few bamboo shoots and a tiny slice of nori. For $88+10%, they could have been a little more generous with the ingredients.Kyokai Ramen0Kyokai Ramen",Ippudo HK,nan,97,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-ippudo-hk/96369?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
Central,Japanese,"Couple of co-workers and I had lunch at this new Japanese restaurant after hearing some good things. The place is located in the space where the recently vacated Hakka Ye Ye used to be. Hakka was one of my favourite restaurants in Central and I was sad to learn that it had closed. Anyways on to Xuan - all of us had an item from the set lunch menu. I ordered the sashimi, tempura, grilled set. The first dish was a small little bowl of noodle like seafood. Then the sashimi came whichwas really fresh and consisted of octopus, tuna, some unidentified fish and shrimp - good sized portion. This was followed by a salad in peanut sauce which was very refreshing. The tempura was lightly battered and was delicious as well. They gave us some salt for dipping, which was really a nice sideline touch. The mackerel though was too sweet. A small litle bowl of seaweed was also served along with white rice and miso soup.$290 plus tip. Overall, very good experience. The decor was nice with a curved sushi bar were you can watch the chef do his carving and a rear area with tables. Dark interior lent to the peaceful ambiance.

I ordered the Daifukuya Rich Broth original ramen noodle that included the braised pork belly, and seasoned soft boiled egg. The condiments tray was minimal and included vinegar, chili pepper, chili oil, and chopped onions. No garlic or pickles.When my bowl of noodles arrived, it looked alright. The noodles were a thicker yellow ramen and cooked until just tender. There were 3 slices of pork, one whole egg, and bamboo stalks. The broth looked thick and full of flavor...except that it wasn't.

Yarou means bastard (& other related swear words).

Central,Japanese,",;OKNice setting for lunch with a sea view;Polite service;Acceptable don set and sashimi but pricey;Tempura was not good and also pricey;Just marginally OK because of the good service.@Decor:Located inside IFC. Comfortable with high ceiling and nice view. The tables were reasonably spaced apart.This place was quite popular but fortuantely we managed to get a seat without waiting. They have a sushi bar area, teppenyaki area, a number of sofa seats for 4-6 next to the window and other tables for two in the middle. The tables were reasonably spaced apart.sofa0sofa 0 , ,,Soba0, ,,SobaGood attention to detail:0Menu:Pretty comprehensive. They serve what you'd expect from most Japanese restaurants, sushi sets, sashimi sets, tempura, various types of don sets, beef sets and teppenyaki sets.The teppenyaki sets looked interesting but since it was our first time here, I decided to order their signature set, the Rei Special Lunch Set.Rei Special Lunch Set (added $40 to have undon instead of rice):First came the sashimi: - ,0 - , Two thick slices for each of the following: Salmon: No complaints. Pretty fresh and thick;Hamachi: I'd give this 75/100 (I have a lower standard when it comes to sashimi when compared with my wife); andChu toro: (I though it's 75/100 but my wife though it's just 60/100 because of the tendons).70070The wasabi wasn't the toothpaste one but not too fresh.They only had one type of shoyu available for everything - i.e. not a special one for sashimi, which wasn't too professional considering an Izakaya like Doraya also uses it. Kosyu took it one step further - they chilled their sushi shoyu, which is even more professional.Then came the full set: - 40,,40,,''un''...0 - 40,,40,,''un''...Salad:A few slices of cabbage with sliced tomato and some ponzu. OkTempura: Two shrimps , one piece of white bodies fish and one shiitake. The shrimp was too salty.  Somehow it got the impression that the shrimps were frozen ones. They might have been defrosted in salt water. Not very appealing at all.The batter for each tempura was crispy but oily. Not recommended.  Two pieces of eel: The sauce was too overwhelmingly sweet. One piece of eel was as hard as rubber. The other small piece was slightly better. When it comes to Unagi , I only trust Kosyu.The udon which I paid HK$40 for was really average stuff. Not very different from instant udon packs. The soup might be home made. It's less salty than most instant unob packs. Nevertheless, definitely Not worth $40.All in all, at HK$298 (plus service and $40 for the udon) the set is overpriced.    Angus Beef Don Set:My wife ordered Angus beef don set: - ,HK$230   : ,,...0 - ,HK$230   : ,,... She ordered well done. According to her, the beef was quite good. However, too much mustard was placed on top of the beef. I tried the rice of that set. It was not bad. Didn't taste like Japanese pearl rice though, it tasted like Mainland vareity.

Central,Japanese,"Suddenly craving for authentic Japanese ramen so decided to come here to try my luck. As it was already past 1.30pm the wait was not too long. Surprisingly most people came as singles so the turnover was quite fast. While waiting outside I already decided to have the Akamaru (was attracted by the black seasame oil) so when the waitress took my order as soon as I got a seat. Was asked to choose between think or thin noodles (chose thin), and soft/normal/hard (chose normal). The noodles arrived not long after and it looked and smelled good! Quickly tried the first scoop of soup - rich and tasty as expected . Then experimented with the self serve additional ingredients (added red ginger, garlic and preserved vegetables). It was only afterwards that I found the garlic press - so had to take out the garlic again to grate it . Finally it was time to dive into the noodles, which were soft but still chewy and balanced well with the soup and toppings.

Central,Japanese,"This place is always full at lunch, not because of the quality of food or service I suspect, but just being full of bankers / lawyers from the Landmark vicinity with clients they want to impress with a well decorated and spacious restaurant with outdoor views. As a warning sign, one rarely sees Japanese clientele here or customers paying out of pocket rather than corporate accounts.On to the food critique...I had the daily set lunch, of HK$450 (!!!) including appetizer (choice of crab salad, tomato salad or salmon tataki), first course of chirashi don / sashimi / or nigiri, and second course of lamb with edamame puree, grilled sea bass or grilled prawn cold noodles. (You can add $180 to upgrade to miso cod or wagyu beef)- Salmon tataki: This was actually the best out of three courses, the salmon was fresh, sliced finely and well-grilled to a slightly burnt finish- Sashimi: Nothing stand-out here and honestly I could get much better sashimi at many of the boutique sushi restaurants in Central or Causeway Bay. The fish neither tasted particularly fresh nor unfresh; in other words, very mediocre. Tuna was not much better than Sen-ryo type quality- Second course: My dining partner had the roasted lamb while I had the noodles. He said the lamb was a bit dry and tough, while my noodles were downright awful. It tasted like the instant noodles or cold ramen you could get in chain restaurants bathed in a tasteless sauce (not even spicy per the description, or maybe watered down for non-Asian tastebuds).

It has a pretty nice calming dark coloured decor (similar to Ana Gura), with a robotayaki area facing the open kitchen and widely spaced-out tables in the middle (perhaps a bit bigger than Ana Gura).We went there early so we could still order their value lunch sets (it think you have to place your order before 12:30p.m.).The menu, which was in Japanese and English, had most standard lunch sets such as sushi sets, sashimi sets, sashimi dons, various types of tempura and grilled cod set.We ordered a ""Three Don Set"" and a ""Grilled Cod Set"".Dons:Both sets came with salad. Just normal salad with a bit of ponzu. No complaints.: ,  - ,, ,...0: ,  - ,, ,...The steamed egg (chawan mushi) was decent. It had ginko in it. But not as good as the one in Sagano, which used scallops, scrimps and a lot of quality dashi.Both sets also came with miso soup. Normal yellow miso soup with silk tofu. Authentic and good - not to be taken for granted. - , 0 - , You could choose 3 dons out of a number of dons. I choose tempura, negi toro (minced tuna) and a sashimi don in order to test their mettle.Negi toro don:This was good. Very nice Japanese rice. The minced toro was pretty fresh. They could have added a lot more negi in my opinion. They had a little bit of mild negi (almost none), onions and gourd, served with good quality, properly grated wasaibi. - ...0 - ...The sesame enhanced the taste as well.There is an interesting Japanese way of eating negi toro: Mix the grated wasabi with soy sauce and then pour the whole mixture on the rice.  I was very happy with this.  Chi ra shi Sashimi don:The prawn was still moving in my don  - very fresh indeed!Good hamachi, akami and salmon. Again, the quality of the sushi rice was good. The vinegar level was just right.  -  - ! , Hamachi,0 -  - ! , Hamachi,Tempura Don:This ""Tendon"" was just average however. The batter was thin and crunchy but a tad oily. The prawn was fresh but the oiliness spoiled it a little. Just OK. - , 0 - , It's very rare to get such good quality sashimi, toro and rice at this price (below HK$160). They got pretty much everything right. All in all, I was a happy man.     Cod Set: - ,0 - ,My wife ordered this. What struck us was the size of the cod:   - !!0 - !!More than 7 inches long and about 1 inch thick. That's almost double the size of a normal cod set.The piece of cod had a lot of fish oil. The timing was good and the flavour was rich.My wife was quite happy with it. But becuase of the large amount of fish oil and the rich taste, she could only finish half of it. I gladly finished up the rest.    Conclusion:The service was very good. The manageress, who spoke fluent Japanese and English, was polite and efficient., ,,!0, ,,!Recommended.

Central,Japanese,"Sushi sase is a high end sushi joint in central. It's a small restaurant with simple decor, but the food is amazing! It was my friend's birthday, so we decided to splurge a little came here for lunch. We both got the Hokkaido sushi set ($400). The meal also comes with miso soup, anda salad.  hokkaido lunch set 0hokkaido lunch set First item that came out with our set was this uni/salmon roe with rice! This huge bowl of rice was fully covered with delicious uni! The uni are very fresh because we see the chef cleaning them in clean water right before serving it to us. The chef explained how uni preserved in salt water is better than the ones stacked on a plate because those are chemically preserved. So at sushi sase, they only use the best quality imgredients.1Then 6 pieces of sushi was prepared separately and served to us one by one. We had a wild salmon, snapper, hamachi, mackerel,fresh crab meat, and house-made tamago. Whatmakes these sushi so different is that the chef usually adds a unique sauce or some condiment that compliments each fish so well and brings the best flavors out. 0Then we were served with a udon soup to end the meal. The udon was simple, but the noodle was smooth and the soup was so delicious that you can drink the whole thing along with the udon. 0I love how sushi sase gives you an intimate environment for you to see the chefs at work as you eat your meal. I also like how the chef willmake your sushi freshly as you finish the sushi piece by piece. The service is also very good here. Although the price is on the higher end, I definitely feel that sushi sase makes your money worth it. It is a must that I will return to try out the omakase with chef table!",SUSHI SASE,nan,440,nan,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-sushi-sase/47958?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
Central,Japanese,"salad0saladchirashi0chirashiMy first time having lunch here, so decided on trying out the daily special chirashi bowl. The set comes with soup and salad but no dessert if you order the special of the day. My bowl of chirashi came out and all I see are small chopped up pieces of tuna & salmon sashimi with one piece of scallop then topped with couple salmon roe. There's also couple pieces of tomago(Japanese egg) that's mixed in. The fish was so sparse on top that I can see the rice on the bottom. I had to eat my sashimi sparingly in order for me to notrun out sashimi to go with my rice later. One thing I would say nicely about this place is the sashimi is still pretty fresh. Other than that, I wouldn't come back and order this lunch set again.",Gyotaku,2.3,150,nan,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-gyotaku/49901?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
