Central,Italian,I wanted the weekend brunch with free flow but the craving for a good pizza took over me. Finis is one of the best places for pizza. The Bronx hits the spot. Fried calamari was great and tiramisu was a bit jelly like and not too sweet.

Central,Italian,"It was a nice dining experience in PICI,in which it is a restaurant sitting just next to PMQ.PMQ is a place always filled with tourists,yet , there aren't a lot of places to eat inside.So , we decided to this place which always filledwith a lot of people.The overall vibe is very british, with furniture's and old lamps .We had three dishes.The first one is the beef tartare.It is well marinated with herbs and not stinky.The meat is tender and goes well with the welcoming bread.Then, we ordered two pastas.One is the pappardelle which is the thick and wide pasta and changed from PICI to that for the cheese and pepper signature taste.The flavour was strong and the texture is nice.The second one we have is the bologne ravioli.The sauce is not as strong as the previous one but the ravioli is in al dente texture . So , it's bravo ,tooThere was on the other day I tried the salmon ravoili andI like that better .

Central,Italian,"Came with a reservation. I think we made the reservation (for 4) on the day of, so it was a little difficult to get a good time. As such, we didn't sit down until like 1:30 pm. Almost everything on the lunch menu is paired with the buffet, which is actually really good. I tried really hard to look for something which didn't include the buffet, but I wasn't able to. As such, it would be nice if the restaurant could maybe think of some options for people who come for lunch but do not want to eat that much (aka the buffet). Anyway, I did actually wind up eating the buffet, and it was pretty good. They have stuff like sesame chicken, poke style tuna (raw), cucumber salad, papaya salad, sun dried tomatoes... quite a big selection! You can pair your buffet with a steak or something like that, but I think it's just too much food. I tried some of the chicken steak, which was quite decent as well. Overall, while I don't actually like eating this much, this place seems like a pretty good deal.",Bistecca Italian Steak House,4.3,250,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-bistecca-italian-steak-house/36543?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

I think its a nice place for lunch as its not crowded, the atmosphere is very nice to take a break from the busy city.

The tuna was good too but nothing special.The tagliolini and pici pastas were fantastic! There was plenty of truffle on the tagliolini and the parmasen and cream ratio was spot on.The safron cream mussel tangliatelle was way too salty for us.

Central,Italian,"Reserved a table for lunch just a few days ago on openrice. It was quite a small restaurant. Reservation should better be made in advance.Came here purely because one of my lunch partners was a vegetarian and there seemed to be quite a number of options in their lunch sets, even with a non-vegetarian option. Comments seemed to be pretty good on openrice too.Lunch Menu0Lunch MenuHowever, we were told that the Spaghetti Bolognese was sold out when we were about to order. There were a few options at different prices which were reasonably priced for lunch in Central. An appetizer and a soup of the day were included in the lunch set, as well as coffee/tea.The appetizer was a simple salad with a lot of vinegar. Personally I found it too heavy and oily although the veggies were fresh. The soup was sweetcorn cream soup which was ok.Mixed Mushroom Spaghetti with Bell Pepper$ 1300Mixed Mushroom Spaghetti with Bell Pepper$ 130I ordered Mixed Mushroom Spaghetti with Bell Pepper as my mains. The spaghetti itself was cooked quite well which was pretty al dente, reasonably al dente at such a price indeed. There were sufficient ingredients with the mushrooms and bell peppers. However, the reason for the below average rating was that it was too salty. It was not too oily despite being fried with oil (obviously) but being too salty was really killing.I just ordered hot lemon water as my drink. There was nothing special to talk about.At such a price, I believe there should be better options elsewhere in the same district. Will not leave it on my to-go list for a weekday lunch.",Mirror & Vegan Concept,2.3,130,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-mirror-vegan-concept/549256?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

It was not so full although reservation was no longer allowed for same day booking.Lunch Set Menu1Lunch Set MenuOrdered two lunch sets to share. Price seemed to have inflated quite a bit from our last visit. Now for 2 courses you need to pay $308+10% with $80+10% top-up for a dessert/cheese.Lunch Menu0Lunch MenuHowever, our major target was their very delicious pizza!Bread Basket0Bread BasketBread basketIt was very bad. All the bread was so cold with hard crust....I remembered the bread was better last time...Pesto Pizza$ 2090Pesto Pizza$ 209Pesto Pizza (Mozzarella, pesto sauce, semi-dried cherry tomato, sun-dried tomato and shaved parmesan cheese)We ate this flavour last time and encored again. We ate immediately after serving. The pizza had super thin and crispy crust. There were loads of toppings but not over. Despite the presence of so much cheese, the flavour was great, not too salty at all. The cheese was so ductile while eating. Really quite a good pizza indeed. Highly recommended. And please note the price of $190+10% which was really not too pricey given the quality and location.Then let's talk about the lunch sets. Here you go the appetizers:White Asparagus with Culatello Ham and Orange Dressing...1White Asparagus with Culatello Ham and Orange Dressing...White Asparagus with Culatello Ham and Orange DressingVery fresh ingredients. The asparagus were ok although they could have been even more tender. They were warm, to my surprise. The Culatello Ham, one of the most prized salumi in Italy, was super fresh and good. The dressing wasn't very orange. Quite a good appetizer after all.Black Rice Salad with Tomato Emulsion and Smoked Stracciatella Cheese...0Black Rice Salad with Tomato Emulsion and Smoked Stracciatella Cheese...Black Rice Salad with Tomato Emulsion and Smoked Stracciatella CheeseInteresting black rice which were not so starchy and a little bit chewy. The tomato emulsion was very refreshing, a bit sour and sweet. The smoked cheese was not so strong. Overall pretty appetizing.Here you go the mains:Homemade Fettuccine with Sausage, Mushroom and Pecorino Cheese ...0Homemade Fettuccine with Sausage, Mushroom and Pecorino Cheese ...Homemade Fettuccine with Sausage, Mushroom and Pecorino CheeseThe Fettuccine itself was ok. Quite al dente although I had expected even more al dente texture. The sauce was ok too, quite creamy but not so cheesy! The minced sausages were really bad! Tasteless like frozen pork and so rough. The mushrooms couldn't help. Very Very bad minced sausages which had ruined the whole dish. Even Chinese-style steamed minced pork was better. Pasta wise it was really not so good as those at 8 1/2.Charcoal Grilled Wagyu Flap Steak with Mashed Potato and French Bean...0Charcoal Grilled Wagyu Flap Steak with Mashed Potato and French Bean...Charcoal Grilled Wagyu Flap Steak with Mashed Potato and French BeanThis mains was better! Quite a big portion of Wagyu with 5 slices! Could tell that the quality was high but I found them too rare so it was not so easy to chew. FYI they hadn't asked how well done we would like it to be cooked. I think it could have been more cooked in my humble opinion. The crust was good though. The French beans and the mashed potato were both tasty!We only ordered 1 dessert to share:Vanilla Custard and Black Cherry Tart with Coconut Ice Cream...0Vanilla Custard and Black Cherry Tart with Coconut Ice Cream...Vanilla Custard and Black Cherry Tart with Coconut Ice CreamIt was served pretty fast. The coconut ice cream was super rich in coconut. The tart itself was not too crunchy nor warm although it was ok with vanilla custard and little black cherry. It really could have been better with the tart, although it was not bad.Overall food quality was pretty good despite the pretty disappointing sausages for the pasta dish. Service was ok, not particularly good or bad. Environment was ok because the tables were quite close to each other so not much privacy indeed. Lunch sets were quite pricey but pizzas were definitely a great deal!

Central,Italian,"It was our second visit. Our first visit about a few years ago hadn't given us a very impressive impression but we had just ordered a few items from their a la carte menu so we thought maybe it was a time for a re-visit and for trying their set lunch menu.A window-side table had been reserved quite a while ago during weekday lunch.Lunch Menu1Lunch MenuLunch Menu0Lunch MenuLunch Menu0Lunch MenuLunch Menu0Lunch MenuIt seemed that after a few years their a la carte menu looked pretty much the same. I still remembered that we had tried Marinated Tuna Tartare which was quite good while their Baby Lamb from Aveyron and Short Rib & Beef Tenderloin were nothing outstanding especially the former.Set Lunch Menu1Set Lunch MenuThere were two lunch sets: 4 courses including appetizer, pasta, main and dessert or cheese at $1080+10% and 3 courses with either pasta or main at your choice and everything else the same at $780+10%. As we were not so hungry, we decided to go for the 3-course lunch set.Bread basket with olive oil & vinegar0Bread basket with olive oil & vinegarVery soon, a bread basket was served to us with olive oil & vinegar already waiting on our desk. There was no introduction of the bread.The bread was served warm with very crispy and thin crust and pretty soft and airy interior. They went great with vinegar which was sour and slightly sweet. I didn't like the olive oil which was kindly served to me by a server pouring it onto a small plate near the plate for the bread. Quite a waste because most was untouched.The cheese stick and the thin crisp were both very crispy, with the former being very rich in cheese flavour.Amuse Bouche0Amuse BoucheThe Amuse Bouche seemed to contain 3 starch balls with cheese and beetroot. The server did introduce to us that there were cheese and beetroot but we couldn't recall what the balls were made of. Taste- and texture-wise they seemed to be made from starch and they were totally TASTELESS! They were nothing comparable with Japanese chewy rice balls. The cheese flavour was very very weak and even the beetroot sauce was the same. The only good thing about the dish was probably the look. Quite disappointing indeed.Rye bread with olive oil & vinegar0Rye bread with olive oil & vinegarThe second bread basket was Rye bread. Again the bread was served warm and the crust was very thin and crispy while the interior was very soft and airy. Again it went great with the vinegar. You would soon know why we need to eat so much bread because the portion of the dishes was really quite small, except for the pasta.RRoasted Octopus with Roasted Artichoke, Aromatic Herbs Dressing...0RRoasted Octopus with Roasted Artichoke, Aromatic Herbs Dressing...Roasted Octopus with Roasted Artichoke, Aromatic Herbs DressingWe ordered both appetisers on the set lunch menu to share. The roasted octopus was ok in terms of texture which was not particularly chewy or tender but it didn't taste particularly fresh. The artichoke was very salty and a bit too rough. The dressing had nothing special. Overall, it was quite disappointing.Scallops in Bread Crust, Sweet Peas Emulsion, Black Truffle...1Scallops in Bread Crust, Sweet Peas Emulsion, Black Truffle...Scallops in Bread Crust, Sweet Peas Emulsion, Black TruffleThis appetiser was much better as the scallops were cooked quite well, with crusty crust made with bread and not fully cooked interior of the scallops. The sweet peas emulsion was ok, not particularly outstanding while the black truffle didn't smell or taste particularly nice either. It could have been even better in my humble opinion.The server had asked if we would like our main and pasta to be served together. It was really appreciated.Scampi Trenette with Datterino Tomato, Basil, Scampi Jus...1Scampi Trenette with Datterino Tomato, Basil, Scampi Jus...Scampi Trenette with Datterino Tomato, Basil, Scampi JusWe chose this over the other one because we didn't like vegetarian pasta much. The Trenette was really al dente, I would say it was of the perfect texture. The Scampi Jus was sufficiently rich and every piece of Trenette was well-flavoured by the Jus. For some reason I found it very slightly spicy which was quite good and appetising. The small Scampi pieces were fresh and crispy too. A very good pasta indeed but definitely not something you couldn't find elsewhere so I had discounted the rating a bit to give it 4 given the fame.Roasted Kinki Fish with Fennel and Tarragon Sauce0Roasted Kinki Fish with Fennel and Tarragon SauceRoasted Kinki Fish with Fennel and Tarragon SauceThe fish had crispy skin but except that there was really nothing special. The sauce was ok but nothing outstanding. The portion was extremely small. The fish was much smaller than my palm.Please note that there was no removal of the bread crusts from our table before the serving of our desserts.Warm Apple Puff with Vanilla Gelato, Caramel Apple Jam...0Warm Apple Puff with Vanilla Gelato, Caramel Apple Jam...Warm Apple Puff with Vanilla Gelato, Caramel Apple Jam...0Warm Apple Puff with Vanilla Gelato, Caramel Apple Jam...Warm Apple Puff with Vanilla Gelato, Caramel Apple JamThe apple puff was slightly warm with a slightly crispy crust. As it was just warm but not really warm enough, there was no particular pleasure to eat it together with the cold vanilla gelato, which was melting as you could tell.Almond Soup with Panna Cotta, Almond and Orange Blossom Gelato...0Almond Soup with Panna Cotta, Almond and Orange Blossom Gelato...Almond Soup with Panna Cotta, Almond and Orange Blossom GelatoThe almond soup was very outstanding though. First of all, it was really special, somewhat like Chinese sweet soup. It was sweet, maybe a bit too sweet to too many people but I liked it, and cold with strong aroma of almond. There were some nuts added to enhance the texture of the sweet soup. You could also break the thin sugar coating on top to add further crispy texture. The gelato wasn't particularly rich in orange blossom though. The best dish of the meal, overall.There was no Petit fours or coffee/tea included in the lunch set.Interior decoration was not particularly outstanding with pretty low ceilings. It was quite full on a weekday for lunch and there was not much privacy although it was quiet enough for a nice chat. Not really a place for special event I would say. The view of the window seats was nothing spectacular just overlooking Mandarin Oriental Hotel and office buildings. Service was ok but it could have been better, e.g. my cup of water was often empty.One point to note was that we did happen to see Chef Umberto Bombana running around throughout our meal.As a 3 Michelin star restaurant, I must say this dining experience was pretty disappointing. At this price, there were definitely better choices at the same district at a similar price with better environment and privacy and even food! I think our second visit would be pretty much the last visit.Let me attempt to compare this dining experience with those recent experiences at other top-notch Michelin restaurants:8 Otto e Mezzo BOMBANABread: 3Amuse Bouche: 1Appetisers: 2.5Pasta: 4.5Mains: 2.5Desserts: 4.5Environment: 3Seating: 3Service: 4Price: $860 for 3 courses for weekday lunch without petit fours or coffee/teaCapriceBread: 4Amuse Bouche: 4Appetisers: 3.5Soup: 4Fish: 3.5Meat: 4Desserts: 4Environment: 5Seating: 5Service: 4.5Price: $990 for 5 courses for weekday lunchhttps://www.openrice.com/zh/hongkong/review/nice-food-with-some-surprises-great-environment-e3265963Mandarin Bar + GrillBread: 3Amuse Bouche: 1Appetisers: 4Pasta: 2Meat: 4Desserts: 3Environment: 4Seating: 3 too close to another table for non-window seatsService: 4Price: $760 for 3 courses for weekday lunch without coffee/tea or petit fours (but with takeaway madeleine)https://www.openrice.com/zh/hongkong/review/%E9%A3%9F%E7%89%A9%E5%8F%83%E5%B7%AE-%E4%B8%8D%E5%80%BC-%E8%A9%A6%E9%81%8E%E5%B0%B1%E7%AE%97-e3218542Gaddi'sBread: 5Amuse Bouche: 4Appetisers: 3.5Meat: 4.5Desserts: 4.5Environment: 5Seating: 5Service: 4.5Price: $680 for 3 courses for weekday lunchhttps://www.openrice.com/zh/hongkong/review/better-food-and-service-after-a-year-e3293944L'Atelier de Jol RobuchonBread: 4Amuse Bouche: 5Appetisers: 3.5Soup: 5Meat: 3 One dish was great but another was a failureDesserts: 3.5Environment: 4Seating: 3Service: 4Price: $660 for 4 courses for weekday lunch.

Central,Italian,"I was browsing where to go for lunch in Central and found this restaurant with 1 Michelin star. Weekday lunch sets didn't seem expensive with costs of $348+10% for 2 courses and $398+10% for 3 courses. So I decided to come try.The restaurant was quite small but the interior decoration was pretty modern with a few paintings. Given the small size, tables were really so closely packed together so that I could hear some of my neighbours' conversations over lunch.Lunch set2Lunch setWe came in a group of two and decided to try everything on their lunch menu so placed our orders right away without studying their menu in details.Bread with butter0Bread with butterAs commented by many other eaters, the bread was really unexpectedly disappointing. Really a bit hard to believe that such bread could be served at such a Michelin restaurant. There was only 1 type of bread with no choice. The crust was crispy but the interior was so thick and heavy. The butter was quite greasy but it was hard not to eat with butter. As you know bread was quite important at such restaurants as the portions of the dishes were quite small so you really need to eat some bread to fill your stomach. The server did keep asking if we would like to have more bread and also helped remove the bread crusts from the table before serving us desserts. I really hope they could do something to improve the bread.The appetisers were served to us very soon.Smoked salmon with jerusalem artichoke, lovage mayonnaise and capers...0Smoked salmon with jerusalem artichoke, lovage mayonnaise and capers...Smoked salmon with jerusalem artichoke, lovage mayonnaise and capersThe smoked salmon and the mayo were quite salty. The jerusalem artichoke couldn't balance the saltiness. The thin crisps on top did help enhance the texture of the dish, however, couldn't help enhance the rating of the dish. I could tell that the smoked salmon was fresh though.Salad of beetroot, endive and blood orange with seared duck heart and toasted walnut...0Salad of beetroot, endive and blood orange with seared duck heart and toasted walnut...Salad of beetroot, endive and blood orange with seared duck heart and toasted walnutIngredients were fresh. But the duck heart wasn't really fully cooked which could have been more chewy and tasted less bloody after being fully cooked. The toasted walnuts were so crushed and not toasted enough. This dish was really not my cup of tea.Then it took quite a while for our mains to arrive.Steamed hake with potatoes and cloud ear mushrooms in a kombu emulsion...0Steamed hake with potatoes and cloud ear mushrooms in a kombu emulsion...Steamed hake with potatoes and cloud ear mushrooms in a kombu emulsionThe steamed hake was very well cooked which was so tender and juicy. The sauce was very tasty in a rich flavour of ""butter"" or ""cream"". The potatoes were well cooked too, a bit chewy texture-wise. Appealing even to me who usually didn't like potatoes. There were a lot of crisps on top of the hake to enhance the texture. Delicious.Braised veal cheek with crushed white beans, morteau sausage, peas and tarragon...0Braised veal cheek with crushed white beans, morteau sausage, peas and tarragon...Braised veal cheek with crushed white beans, morteau sausage, peas and tarragonThe veal cheek was very well braised and was really tender. To pick bones from an egg, the beef flavour could have been richer though. The sauce was delicious too but a bit more salty than that of the fish dish. I was surprised to see a little bit of black truffle added to the dish but it didn't add much flavour to the dish overall. This was still a good dish but less good than the fish dish. By the way, we couldn't really find morteau sausage from the dish.After finishing our mains, it took a long long time for them to serve us desserts.Sweet corn ice cream with beurre noisette, kaffir lime chantilly...0Sweet corn ice cream with beurre noisette, kaffir lime chantilly...Sweet corn ice cream with beurre noisette, kaffir lime chantillyThis was quite a special dessert with very rich sweet corn flavour. If you hadn't tried it before, I would recommend it to you. Texture-wise it could have been better but the rating of 5 was given taking into account the creativity.Tomme de savoie with pear chutney and lavoche0Tomme de savoie with pear chutney and lavocheTomme de savoie with pear chutney and lavocheThis type of cheese was of the right degree of saltiness, which was pretty good. The thin crisps were fresh and good. The pear chutney was ok too, slightly sweet to balance the salty cheese, and I wish there were more.The set didn't include anything else like petite fours or amuse bouche or coffee/tea. Given the portion (especially the bread which was the major items to fill up your stomach), it was really a bit hard to justify the cost. Although location was central, the tables were too closely packed together for some privacy. Service was ok as the server did try to fill up my glass of water from time to time. It was a bit less efficient given the small number of dishes to serve. I would say I would rather top the price up a little bit to go somewhere for even better/more food and environment. Having tried all their items on the weekday lunch menu with some disappointments, I don't think I would go back again. That said, I would still give it an overall OK rating rather than a crying face.",Arcane,3.3,440,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-arcane/190855?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw
Central,Italian,"Weekday lunch at Aracne. I went for the 3 course set lunch, priced at $398. A 2 course is also available at $328. All of the courses were very nice, I'd never had sweet corn ice cream but the combination really worked. I sat at the kitchen counter which is great to be a part of the action, but you might prefer a regular table for a more comfortable dining experience. Service was attentive, my only criticism would be the average bread and the overpriced bottle of Evian ($78).

Central,Italian,"Just a random weekday lunch with colleague, Ciao Chow is always on the top priority of my lunch list in Central. I still remember the steak when I first visited Ciao Chow, it was awesome, nevertheless it was tick off from the lunch set menu. This time, I tried the penne with clams, it was a little bit too salty, and the penne wasn't well cooked. On the other hand, I love the presentation of the ice lemon tea as well as the tiramisu. The taste of the tiramisu was so great that I even think it might be one of the best in town. The lunch set does not include the tiramisu, so you have to order it a la carte, but it definitely worth the money.Ice lemon tea0Ice lemon teapenne with clams 0penne with clams Tiramisu0Tiramisu",Ciao Chow - Italian Cafeteria,3.3,200,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-ciao-chow-italian-cafeteria/475005?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
Central,Italian,"Pizza is a guilty pleasure of mine! I rarely eat it and prefer to get something lighter most days, but once in a while you can't beat a lil' slice of heaven.I went there during lunch time with a friend who considers herself a bit of a pizza connoisseur, so since it was a place that she has suggested before, I felt it must be a good choice. We both went for the lunch deal, which seemed pretty good value at 128 hkd, which included a starter and main. For the starter, we both chose the corn on the cob, which wasn't bad at all; crunchy, spicy and light enough to ease you into the main.corn on the cob0corn on the cobFor the mains, we chose the 'Bacon corn' and the 'Soppressata Picante'. The Bacon corn didn't come with tomato, so it was more like a cheese bread, but you can choose to add tomato if you really want to. Both were generally ok I thought, the dough was light and cooked well enough so it was a tad soft to cut into -opposed to burnt and/or crumbly. The Soppressata Picante was the nicer of the two as it had more flavour and a little spicy kick to it, though it was a little sloppy, from the runny tomato base. If I had a suggestion it would be to cook the top of the pizza a little longer so it binds together better and taste much better if the cheese was slightly crispy.Soppressata Picante0Soppressata PicanteThe actual place itself was nice and clean and the staff were efficient and attentive.FINAL VERDICT:For a very filling lunch at a reasonable price, it's definitely worth a try!",Motorino,3.5,140,10,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-motorino/130619?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

Central,Italian,"I really had never noticed there was such a restaurant in such a central location in Central, until I was brought by my friend to visit this place for lunch some day.We were quite amazed by the pretty interior decoration as we entered the restaurant, which was pretty antique. It was quite a large place with comfortable seats.Lunch Menu3Lunch MenuThe Salads and desserts buffet was charged at a cost of $188+10%. We each ordered this as well as some pizzas and pastas to share. The top-up price of $66+10% seemed quite attractive.Salads Buffet0Salads BuffetPlease excuse me for not having taken photos of the Salads and Desserts buffet tables. To be frank, I honestly thought that there could have been more choices at such a price at the beginning.There were 3 types of Italian cold cuts including Parma ham, normal ham and salami. So bad there were no melons to go along with the Parma ham. There were other meat including thin pork slices with tuna sauce which I found really delicious and tender, and also duck breasts which I didn't try.There were a few types of greens, among which the spinach tasted particularly fresh and good. Some lettuces had turned a little bit brown though.There were also some pre-made and pre-mixed salads like Greek salad, pumpkin salad, rice salad etc. Toppings included some olives, dried tomatoes and walnuts. There was just one type of really hard cheese though.The Mascarpone cheese on the beetroot slices tasted really good with my favourite soft cheese texture. The asparagus was pretty fresh too.There were two types of soups: tomato soup and pumpkin soup. I tried the pumpkin soup which was above average, with the right degree of concentration.There were also some Italian bread and focaccia which I didn't have room to try.Overall, I would say the quality of the salads buffet was above average after trying, and the choices were sufficient to fill your stomach.Our pizzas and pastas arrived shortly after our orders.Salmone Affumicato Pizza (Tomato sauce, mozzarella, smoked salmon, rocket)...$ 660Salmone Affumicato Pizza (Tomato sauce, mozzarella, smoked salmon, rocket)...$ 66I didn't eat the smoked salmon pizza right away and when I ate it it had cooled down already. Yet it was still good with crispy and thin crust. It was not overly salty with the smoked salmon and mozzarella. The only complaint was that there was not enough rocket paste (the green paste?) on the pizza. At a price of $60+10% to top up for this pizza, I would say it was quite a good value for money. The portion was indeed big. It was good to share.Margherita Pizza (Tomato sauce, mozzarella, basil)$ 660Margherita Pizza (Tomato sauce, mozzarella, basil)$ 66Comparatively, the Margherita pizza was less pleasing although the crust was also crispy and thin. Again, there could have been more basil.Tagliolini, tomato sauce, basil & Tagliatelle, clams, taggiasca olives...$ 1320Tagliolini, tomato sauce, basil & Tagliatelle, clams, taggiasca olives...$ 132Maybe it was because I didn't eat the pasta right away, the tagliolini was all stuck together when I ate and it was really so so disappointing! The tagliatelle was much better although it was no longer al dente, yet it offered a very rich egg flavour. The taggiasca olives were surprisingly free of the typical yucky olive flavour, as I was never a fan of olives. Overall, I would say pizzas were way better than pastas.Desserts Buffet0Desserts BuffetThere were quite a few choices of desserts and the quality of all those I had tried was pretty good.The berry mousse cake on the left was very delicious and light despite the white cream.The lemon tart in the middle was pretty light too.The pistachio ball with coffee cream inside was tasty although the coffee cream was not particularly rich (which was actually good for me because I was never a fan of coffee) and the cookie case was super crunchy!The caramel ball was also delicious and looked so attractive.The chocolate brownie at the far end of my plate was also crunchy and not particularly greasy.There were also other choices of desserts which I had no room to try.There was also a bowl of diced fruits on the desserts buffet table.Service was ok although the restaurant seemed to be full house. At such a price, I think the quality of the food especially desserts (maybe not the pasta), the location, the interior decoration, the environment and the service did justify the cost. Glad that now I have one more choice on my to-go list for lunch.",Spiga,4.1,256,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-spiga/509862?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

Without hesitation, I took the two tall stools at the bar and in split second those at al fresco were occupied.Surprisingly, quite a number of seats were available after 1315 hrs. Not sure if it is a norm.Anyway, the lunch menu is simple and clear. $148 for starters + Pasta + Dolci. We took Beef Tartare, Radiccho salad as starters, Pappardelle & Plin ravioli as pasta and one tiramisu as dolci (you can choose expresso as alternative). They also serve bread at the start.At the bar, you can observe the young lady making the pasta with the machine. A good showmanship to demonstrate that their pasta is fresh daily.The restaurant is quite stylish and has its character. I checked the outlook of their other two restaurants in Wanchai and Tsim Sha Tsui and they are of similar style. However, may be it is a bit packed, it is quite noisy and soft voices as we both are, it's good opportunity to practice raising our voices.The portions of starters were above expectation. As for pasta, the Ravioli had six pieces and the portion of Pappardella was a bit smaller. However, the sauces of the two dishes blended well with the pasta.The Tiramisu is large, served in a large glass.

Central,Italian,"We were the only customers in the restaurant and there were equal ratio of waiting staff so there should not have been a service issue but we did not have a good experience and did not feel welcome. When we arrived at 12, the restaurant did not look ready, grocery delivery was still at the door and the waitress was unhappy to see us. I said to her that the sign downstairs said the restaurant was opened from 11am and she said it was not correct. She made us wait for our table.She proceeded to sit us at the smallest table in the restaurant. I asked her if she was expecting a full house and she said yes. By the time we left at 1:30pm we were still the only customers there. She then gave me several set of menus but none for the rest of the table as if to ask me to pass them around! Water not topped up after served once etc etc . Soooooo disappointed with her service. The set lunch was of an excellent value. It came with a glass of house wine. I asked what wine it was and she just said House. So I asked if it was red or white and she said rose. When the wine came it was white. A glass of wine by the way meant a 1/6 glass of wine I.e. 2 sips. By that time I was tired of her  and just wanted to eat and leave.The table was dirty, my napkin was obviously from previous setting not washed and the plates were chipped.We had the pizza lunch set and the pizza was well cooked.

So many Italian restaurants have come and gone in this city but I'm happy to see that this one has endured the test of food business turnovers. Competition is tough and having transients (expats) as patrons that leave the city within a year or two, I imagine it must be tough surviving in this industry.....The thing though is that I've never felt as welcomed as I do whenever I go to Posto and I think, apart from the lovely dishes that they serve, this is really what makes me come back: the hospitality which Hong Kong restaurants have yet to cultivate.I'm glad this restaurant is still thriving.

Turns out, because it was a public holiday(?), they were serving a special brunch buffet menu for $388. Ok, fair enough, guess it was our fault and we should have double checked. However, we wanted to see if the $188 buffet was still available. Doesnt hurt to ask right?Everything went downhill from there.The server/manager? (he was the only male staff in a suit who walked around with an unmistakable sense of self importance) came to our table thinking we wanted to order but instead we asked about the other buffet menu. He replied condescendingly that the only buffet menu is the one in our hands. Uh, thanks for talking down to us? Its amazing how a cheap suit can make an unrefined man so arrogant. Nothing against his uniform, but hey, manners maketh man. Ok fine, having a random stranger give us major attitude is not the best way to start a birthday brunch with my girlfriends but since we were here already might as well stay. The buffet comes with a main,  so we decided to order 1 main each for the 5 of us. These upscale restaurants usually have small portions anyway. Unfortunately, it was again the cocky manager who came to our table when we wanted to order. When he found out we were ordering 5 mains, he said something along the lines of - wow, thats a lot of food. You ladies must be very hungry. With the same condescension as before, of course. Excuse me? That comment was wrong for many reasons. Besides, last I checked the main was INCLUDED, whats wrong with getting the full amount of food were paying for? We later figured that he probably didnt want to waste food, thinking we wouldnt be able to finish everything. No wonder he said hed give us only 2 of the 5 mains first. Under other circumstances I may have attributed that to thoughtful service but with all the snarky comments this guy was making I dont think he was being so kind.To be fair, apart from that one guy, everyone else who worked there seemed really nice.

This appetizer required a top-up of $80 from their lunch set. The beef tartare itself was so dry and seemed not fatty enough while the rocket and cherry tomatoes were fresh. The Parmesan shaves tasted good with great texture.Norcina (Homemade sausage, mushroom and mozzarella) & Estiva (Mozzarella, cherry tomato, rocket, Parma ham and shaved parmesan)...$ 3080Norcina (Homemade sausage, mushroom and mozzarella) & Estiva (Mozzarella, cherry tomato, rocket, Parma ham and shaved parmesan)...$ 308These two flavours were worse than the one we had last time, which I recalled was Pesto (Mozzarella, pesto sauce, semi-dried cherry tomato, sun-dried tomato and shaved parmesan cheese). Last time it was so freshly baked, crispy and juicy. This time Norcina seemed so dry while the sausage and mushrooms were nothing special. Estiva was better as it was less dry with the cherry tomato and rocket but the Parma ham was a bit too salty. The crust was not so crispy and much less freshly baked like before. I was so disappointed.Pan Fried Red Snapper with Bell Pepper Sauce and Baby Corn...1Pan Fried Red Snapper with Bell Pepper Sauce and Baby Corn...The red snapper was so dry and rough, maybe a problem of pan-frying?

Central,Italian,"This place opened up in 2016 I believe and is the only place in Hong Kong with a DOC for Neapolitan pizza, a story customers need to give an otherwise simple pizza joint/trattoria some special attention. Ciao Chow occupies a prime spot in LKF with almost a third of its seating locating outdoorsgreat for smokers and if the weather is fine. As is typical with most western eateries operated by F&B corps, servers are staffed by a south Asian team, most of whom are OK but I could picture some improvement there. One could tell that management has work to do just by experiencing the state of mess the (only) bathroom was in, not to mention the delay in having us seated despite my having made a reservation well in advance.We had a lunch set with pizza ($199) and a separate  la carte order for spinach and beetroot salad (they ran out of beetroot). Overall the dining experience was averageno more and no less. Seating was not particularly spacious and the pizza wasnt spectacular given that diners, including myself, do come with some expectations. I am speculating that this place is probably a better option for a spontaneous, casual drink on a breezy night. Given the lack of restaurants offering genuinely tasty, memorable pizza in Hong Kong, I might give Ciao Chow another shot, but the dining experience I had makes this unlikely as there are so many other options in the city.Food Rundown0Potato soup (part of a $199 lunch set)0Pizza margherita (part of a $199 lunch set)Honestly, the tomato sauce was very tasty. Its blended with bits of marzano tomatoes and the depth of flavor of rich tomato pure combined with basil is difficult to beat for pizza at this price in Hong Kong. The crust was great as well. I would give this a solid 75/100.0Iced lemon tea (part of a $199 lunch set)0Spinach and beetroot salad, $118 (opted for tomatoes instead as they ran out of beetroot)Sorry, but this is not really up to standard for salad ordered  la carte in Central.0",Ciao Chow - Italian Cafeteria,2.7,200,5,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-ciao-chow-italian-cafeteria/475005?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
Central,Italian,"We came over to Bistecca for its weekend brunch buffet in November and the overall experience was decent for its $288 price tag, and we wondered why the restaurant was so empty. We ordered steak on top of the buffet, but for whatever reason there was a miscommunication and the steak never came. We cancelled and left with some regrets. On that occasion, the crab legs from the buffet were relatively big and fresh, and I was particularly impressed by the salad selection where baby spinach, artichokes and a good range of vegetarian dishes were not only of good quality, but delicious. That was why we took family here on the first day of 2018.As it turned out, the restaurant had just one occupied table of four at 1pm, and remained so for the rest of our 2-hour meal. There was no sign of baby spinach or artichokesonly iceberg lettuce that looked somewhat aged. Crab legs were very much below standard (in size and freshness) and in general our guests were not impressed by the food. Fortunately, we ordered a 28oz Delmonico bone-in rib-eye and lobster tail to go with the buffet. The steak turned out to be excellent and loaded with flavor, a pretty impressive achievement given that the restaurant didnt have time to let it rest at room temperature for long. Lobster tail was finesalt was unevenly rubbed on, which made some bites unbearably salty.I imagine this may be related to inexperienced or uncommitted management that isnt making the most of the resources available of a relatively successful F&B group. Our booking online was also penalized as a no show despite the fact that weve made it clear who we are and how we booked at the time of the meal (this has now been sorted out, after the review I submitted was deleted). The standard of service was also below par overall, with some waiting staff being extra professional while the rest were either inexperienced or downright unfriendly.We may or may not return for the good steak, but given how common it is for excellent restaurants in Admiralty and Central to offer weekend brunch buffets at roughly the same price, I believe guests who have had a bad experience will be unlikely to make another bet.010100",Bistecca Italian Steak House,nan,600,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-bistecca-italian-steak-house/36543?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

Central,Italian,"Summary: If it really is vegan, It might just be the best vegetarian restaurant in Hong Kong. Delicious dishes that are way too rich/creamy to be soy/coconut/nut-based, but if they are, are incredibly well-done. Bring your meat-loving friends for lunch and open their eyes to a better world (hope you all like carbs though).We must have said I cant believe this is vegan at least 10 times collectively during our lunch. Between the incredible risottos and creamy pastas, I still have a hard time believing there wasnt a drop of cream or dairy-based product in any of the food. They serve both lunch sets and dinner a la carte, but we stopped by for lunch on a miserably cold and rainy afternoon.Their lunch set (~120+) comes with a daily starter (simple salad) and a soup of the day (cauliflower), as well as a main course (all of which were pasta or risotto). The cauliflower soup was, as will be a reoccurring comment all-review, far richer than normal cauliflower and potato purees (the cauliflower soup at Mana for example is far lighter), but also lacked that tell-tale coconut-ness which Im extremely sensitive to (I hate it). Delicious and flavorful, it was also served with a piece of toasted bread that was covered in what tasted like butter (margarine I assume?).The main courses are where we were really blown away, I mean check these out:Spinach and Mushroom Risotto with ArtichokeSpinach and mushroom risotto0Spinach and mushroom risottoSeriously, not only was this completely indistinguishable from a standard butter-and-cheese affair, its probably the best risotto Ive had in a long time. From its inexplicably rich texture and just-perfectly-undercooked rice, to the flavour of the mushrooms, not forgetting the sophisticated inclusion of the artichokes (served lightly grilled on top) to provide some zing, this was simply a top-notch dish, anytime, anywhere. That it was found in this modest vegan caf is something else.Creamy Pesto and Zucchini Cappellini0My friend said it was delicious but I didnt have a bite looks incredibly creamy. How?We also had a white asparagus and truffle pasta that I didnt try, and dont have a picture of, but heard was equally delicious, though it was without any sort of cream.As should be obvious Im mystified how this place is able to pull off this type of food without animal-based products. You could put that spinach and mushroom risotto up against any non-vegan risotto in town in terms of richness, consistency of texture, and flavour. Its a small odd-looking place with tons of mirrors everywhere, but if this place is really vegan (still cant believe it), you can look at yourself for the whole meal with a clear conscience and a happy stomach. If youre even a bit interested in vegetarian food OR great pasta and risotto, you have to try this place.",Mirror & Vegan Concept,4.5,130,nan,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-mirror-vegan-concept/549256?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

My colleaguess pizzas were lovely too.I ordered a pasta alla vodka in order to compare it with the one served at Carbone. My colleagues ordered pizza, linguini with clams and a Brooklyn sandwich. The pasta was al dente and bursting with tomato flavor. It was less rich than the one at Carbone but Im still happy with it. My only quibble is this: its virtually the same as the pasta being served at the buffet! Well, being extra positive, at least for $30 odd dollars, I get to have warm pasta served to me directly.

Central,Italian,"Walked past this newly opened cosy looking restaurant after yoga earlier this week and found their lunch menu looking good, so I decided to give it a try today... I arrived at 12:30 and was warmly welcomed by the bar tender who asked if I'd like a table upstairs. Feeling curious, I gladly took his advice.0This was my first visit (and I had never been to the Bar here, ""Tipping Point"", before). Love the minimalist decor in white and Scandinavian blue.0000The menu's the same as the one I saw when I walked past on Tuesday --- a selection of pasta (from the classic Carbonara, the vegetarian optionTomato basil cherry to the meat lover's no-brainer Sausage and beef ragu), Risotto ai fungi porcini and pan-fried Salmon & pesto veggies. A two-course lunch with drinks included from HK$88 - 110.0My friend went for the Soup and I had the Salad.Cauliflower Soup0Cauliflower SoupHe liked the Cauliflower Soup packed with ""grains"" of cauliflower, which wasn't overly creamy. It was light enough to be enjoyed on a super hot day like this.""all fera"" fresh selections (Salad)0""all fera"" fresh selections (Salad)The ""all fera"" Salad --- a bed of mixed salad topped with grilled zucchini, grilled eggplants, shaved cheese, chia seeds, in pommery honey dressing.A decent portion for the price of this lunch deal, sprinkled with chia seeds to give them the extra crunchiness, in an apt amount of dressing (hmmm but where's the cheese...?). Pretty fresh Romaine, not the freshest rocket, but I'm happy with this considering the price and location.pan-fried Salmon & pesto veggies0pan-fried Salmon & pesto veggiesThe pan-fried Salmonwas cooked and seasoned on point.

There was a bit of an imbalance compared to the salmon and baby potatoes (which were ""shining in oil"") --- the broccoli was boiled and unseasoned. As a health conscious foodie I always cook my veggie pretty plainly, but this tasted a bit too plain even for me. I'd say they could be easily touched up by a toss of extra-virgin olive oil.Sausage and beef ragu with fettuccine pasta0Sausage and beef ragu with fettuccine pastaMy friend enjoyed his pasta and said he'd be back!0And of course, an iced-lemon tea for a melting hot day like this.All in all, this was one great lunch deal in the heart of Central/Soho.

Central,Italian,"I was feeling lazy and decided to order pizza. My pizza standard in general is quite high, but i've learned that in Hong Kong it really shouldn't be. Recently I have been disappointed by Jacomax and Piccolo, so I decided to give Pizza Express a try. Overall, it's pretty good, and I think I might actually order again someday.Price and portion: i did not feel ripped off. I ordered the ""Special Set"" ($333) which includes ""2x pizza or pasta, 1x garlic bread with parmesan and gorgonzola, 1x dough balls with nutella."" that is a lot of food, in my opinion, for the money, and my intention was always to keep the leftovers for the next day. One thing though is that in the special set there is no salad, which I would have preferred to, say, the nutella dough balls (i just don't like sweet/dessert things in general). Some green stuff would have been nice.Taste: not bad, not bad. the ""garlic bread"" was nice. the dough was extremely fluffy and the gorgonzola was pungent as it should be. My only gripe is that I really couldn't taste any garlic---just gorgonzola. also, these guys i guess because of how fluffy the dough is don't make great leftovers, as they get stale pretty quick.0the lasagna actually had a decent taste. i didn't really appreciate the obviously burnt top, but that didn't affect the flavor much anyway. the bolognese and bechamel sauces in the lasagna were surprisingly good though. also, it makes great leftovers.now for the pizza: we got the classic margherita pizza, and it was pretty good. the nicest surprise was the sauce, which tasted like a properly made tomato sauce, even if the texture was slightly too smooth. the crust though was underwhelming. i'm really picky about pizza crust. pizza is supposed to be cooked in an insanely hot oven on an insanely hot surface that leaves the crust on the bottom crispy and nearly burnt while the cheese on top melts and the tomato sauce roasts. this strikes me as pizza that was not cooked in an optimally hot oven, and so the crust was kind of soft for my tastes. meh.also, i ordered one topping, the spicy red peppers. don't do that. they put barely any peppers on top and the topping costs $18. the pizza is fine by itself.the nutella dough balls were good, though i'm not sure how they could actually be messed up.overall i think this place is pretty good and we will likely order again the next time we are feeling lazy.000",PizzaExpress,2.7,160,nan,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-pizzaexpress/456048?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

My friend arrived before 12:45pm and we ordered quickly because my friend came from Taikoo so we were pretty rush to start with.The salad quickly arrived. Greens were fresh but nothing special - just balsamic vinaigrette and veggies.We waited and waited til 1:20pm for the mains - which were just pesto pasta and risotto. My pasta is not very al dente and the pesto sauce is really average. The clams, which were placed nicely around the pasta, were also average. Portion was just right but seriously, I don't know why a pasta dish takes almost half an hour to cook.By the time we quickly finished the food and had the drink, we just had to run out at 1:50pm. As we passed by the big table right beside us, none of the diners got any food yet and they were here just slightly later than us.If you are in a rush, avoid this restaurant. And food - it's like those served at cafes in commercial buildings of Causeway Bay or Mongkok but price is charged as a Central westernized restaurant.

Central,Italian,", , , , ,, 3/10I've always been fairly curious about Armani/Aqua, primarily due to it's mysterious and cool looking front entrance. Unfortunately, having had lunch there, the front entrance remains to be the only impressive item.1The interior was fairly classy, as you would expect from a collaboration between Armani and Aqua. Much to my pleasant surprise, there was even a children playroom at one end of the restaurant. 0There was this new free flow brunch set with unlimited starters on offer at about $600. ($400 odd without alcohol). We chose the non-alcohoic version - big mistake as our tastes buds were able to fully engage in the taste of the food.The ""unlimited starters"" would end at 3:00 pm. It consisted of, amongst others, some not very fresh looking sushi and sashimi, similarly unfresh oysters and assorted seafood (shellfish and crabs), smoked salmon and salad. There were also parma ham, salami, and a pasta corner where you could order angel-hair or a mickey pizza. The food did not look appetizing to me at all. It was rather a rather depressing sight and I did not take anything from the starters. Those who had the sushi thought that the taste of the sauce was rather odd. The neta was not fresh. 1The hot starters from the Japanese corner were slightly better than the cold ones, even though I did not enjoy the onsen tamago with truffle. I had to ask for extra soy sauce before I could wash it down. The tempura prawns were not bad but nothing exceptional. Those were on the oily side. I did not try the piece of wagyu on offer as I do not eat beef. The others did not enjoy it.The stuffed chicken wings with mentaigo was really average stuff. Not what I would expect from an allegedly top notch Japanese/Italian restaurant. The polenta balls with cream cheese (?) were interesting but not particularly tasty.1The hot mains from the Japanese kitchen were also rather disappointing. The texture of the salmon, half cooked and half raw, was rather weird. The oily batter and what seemed to be tar tar sauce did not help. The foie gras were cold and bland. The wagyu patties (or hamburgers) were again very average stuff. Those who had the beef did not enjoy it.0At this stage, most of us were already completely demoralized and did not have the interest to carry on. The hot mains from the Italian kitchen fared a bit better. Most of the lamp racks were fine other than 1 or 2 pieces which did not taste well. The few pieces of paprika were probably the freshest item in the whole meal.At least the little one enjoyed the mickey pizza and the play room.1To be perfectly fair, the desserts were very good.1The cup of green tea, despite being contained in a stylish but highly user-unfriendly cup, was also not bad.0Service was very good.All in all, unless your primary purpose is to enjoy free-flowing drinks/desserts, I would steer clear away from this place.0",Armani / Aqua,nan,520,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-armani-aqua/61124?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
Central,Italian,"After hanging out with family and friends for much of the festive holiday, I decided to take things a little slowly today. A late lunch just between the three of us was what I had in mind. I was trying hard to decide between Uncle Robuchon and chef Bombana but once I heard about L'Atelier de Jol Robuchon's children policy, it was pretty clear that 8 1/2 Otto e Mezzo Bombana would be the one we would be visiting this afternoon.0The good thing about chef Bombana's festive menu is that everything from starter to dessert is a simple choice between two selections. I think I can handle that.0Lunch started off brightly with the first starter of the afternoon, crispy langoustine. This tasted a little like our famous Chinese dish, salted egg yolk prawn () with the sweet little langoustine tightly coated with something like salty egg yolk on the outside. The citrus anchovy dressing was a very impressive addition to the mix and the small winter vegetable salad did well to balance the richness of the langoustine. Very nice start.Crispy langoustine, winter salad0Crispy langoustine, winter saladThe second starter turned out to be even better than my crispy langoustine.

Central,Italian,"Last December has been one of the quietest Decembers in recent memory when it comes to restaurant openings in the city. Replacing Lupa on the third floor of LHT Tower in Central, Spiga headlined just a small list of newbies making their debuts prior to the Christmas season.Spiga has brought to us by Dining Concepts in collaboration with two-Michelin-starred chef Enrico Bartolini. I first heard of chef Bartolini when he was the consulting chef for the now-closed Venetian restaurant SEPA and he put together quite an impressive menu highlighted by some really exciting bite-sized cicchetti. As one of the youngest Italian chef to ever score two Michelin stars, my expectation is naturally high for his new project Spiga.0I had the pleasure of celebrating my birthday here a few years ago when the place was still called Lupa.

Central,Italian,"SPIGA, just opened by michelin 2 stars chef Enrico Bartolini,  locates at the heart of Central district.  It is quite an ambitious project as the restaurant is very large (more than 120 seats) along with open area for outdoor seating.  We are surprised as the only couple in the restaurant during their Sunday brunch section.  It is almost too lonely in certain way.  Good that half way of the brunch, there came 2 or 3 more couples.  Otherwise, it would be a scary scene.  Hopefully, the quietness is only due to soft opening trial period.Sunday brunch being offered at HKD 388 with a choice of main dish.  The buffet comes with around 30 choices of cold cut, salad, cheese, bread, crab and lobster, hot lasagna, etc.  There are also more than 10 different desserts.The buffet food quality overall is very good as the seafood are very fresh.  The lasagna and eggplant hot food at the buffet bar is particular good, and in my opinion, it is even better than the main dish.  It certainly has the home made taste.  The eggplant has a very soft creamy texture and strong flavour that makes me go for another round instantly.  For the main dish, we ordered the home made angel hair with tomato sauce and fried egg with spinach black truffle.  The angel hair pasta got a very good chewy texture while the tomato sauce is just average though.  The fried egg spinach with truffle is very good.  We are pleasantly surprised by the amount of black truffle slices sit on top of the dish.  It matches very well with the egg and tendered spinach.  In my opinion, the pasta dish is a bit ordinary but when we mixed the two dishes together for sharing, it is a perfect companion.Afterwards, we each went for their dessert bar and we are also pleased by the dessert quality.  The tiramisu and creme brulee are the best among all.  Overall, we are pleased with the food quality but maybe due to the buffet nature, there arent a single dish that really stands out that make us feel memoriable.  However, you can sense there are certain home made taste being associated with the dishes.  Setting is very comfortable with high ceiling and warm lightning but again, they are still in the soft opening period and a couple of things are still a bit sloppy for the service.  For restaurant that can potentially occupy more than 120 guests would definitely requires a perfect execution and management.   Also, it would take sometime for them to mark their identity in the competitive HK culinary field.  We will definitely come back for their dinner menu as the lunch buffet certain hasnt really shown Chef Enrico's full calibre.

But it is not hot enough when it arrived at my table. I guess one of the possible reasons is that there are not enough waiters/waitresses serving the customers. My pizza has been sitting in the open-kitchen for some time before it was delivered to me. I was sitting right opposite the open-kitchen so I could see clearly what has been going on.

Central,Italian,"Celebrity chef Harlan Goldstein is coming back with a vengeance. Following less than a year's hiatus, the hulking chef is returning to the local dining scene with a bang. And this time around, he's not returning with just one, not even two but three new restaurants all on Lyndhurst Terrace ().Ee Da Le, meaning Italy in Cantonese, is the first of the three restaurants to debut last month. And the writing is already on the wall - it's a rustic Italian eatery serving modern and classic Italian dishes.0This first looks a little funky for a rustic Italian restaurant but I like the Italian opera-skirt inspired lampshades combining well with the predominantly wooden interior.00A little nibble to get us going first while we waited for our starters to arrive.0First up was something that we ordered from the set lunch menu - vine-ripened tomato tartare.Vine-ripened tomato tartare with rocket leaves and mozarella...0Vine-ripened tomato tartare with rocket leaves and mozarella...It was topped by some rocket leaves and a slab of mozzarella while finishing with a balsamic dressing.

Central,Italian,"We were aggressively welcomed by a manager asking us if we had a booking, which is quite ridiculous since the venue was almost empty.  As soon as we sit down waiters were already asking us to order, and brought us 4 different menus, pressing us to be fast, and subsequently pushing us to order more water.We went there to eat Italian, but it was actually Cantonese- Italian fusion cuisine, and this would have been also acceptable, if the restaurant was actually advertised like that. But, even from the sign in the entrance, you can see that the restaurant was conceived as a ""Rustic Italian"" restaurant and this is clearly not the case. Every dish, even the most simple like bruschetta, was messed up and nothing actually followed italian recipes or traditions. The staff is all local and they actually cook local food! It's wrong to talk about Italian restaurant and Italian cuisine if it's basically managed by locals.Risotto is completely wrong because rice is cooked in the wrong way, too much water and oil, I believe taleggio was actually poor quality gorgonzola, and we could not see black truffle in the plate. And even the plate the risotto was served in is wrong, since it is supposed to be a flat dish.The pizza was a piece of bread reheated from the night before, too small, no high quality tomato, but again stracciatella bought in bulk.In the recipe it is said that the suckling pig is made in the Roman Style, slow cooked, but i guess it was heated in the microwave.

Central,Italian,"Quick Squiz:Like a fluffy warm blanket is to Winter and a refreshing sea breeze is to summer, Mercato hits the notes for a comforting (and comfortable) no fuss go-to place for casual food in a tastefully designed environment with humble yet tasty food to boot. More about the restaurant:Stepping out of the elevator, we were greeted by three ladies in identical black dresses over a whitewashed backdrop. For a moment I thought we were been greeted to an appointment with a mad scientist.Stepping into the restaurant, the red brick walls and flooring, arches and wooden furniture was reminiscent of an outdoor patio. Natural light flowed in abundance on the matte surfaces of the bricks and the walnut-esque oversized dining table (a shared table) giving off a nice warm glow soft light in the airy restaurant. The ambiance set an excellent start to a casual weekday lunch.0Their lunch menu included reasonable selection for entrees, mains and desserts (depending on how many courses you choose). As a word of warning, we were told the two course menu = entree and main (non-negotiable) which was a little disappointing as I wanted a dessert fix without needing to go through all the food  . That said, their dessert options weren't nearly as attractive as their entrees and mains so there wasn't too much to lose. Plus, I think I could guess why (their entree sizes are pretty big and are meant to be part and parcel to the meal for it to be sufficiently filling).To start off, there's the complementary bread which I probably have the least to say about. These were very mundane, and I took greater interest in its nice wooden serving container over the bread.complementary bread0complementary breadFor entrees, we had the calamari rings and salad to share. These were very well portioned. And when you compare it to the mains, I would probably call these the first main and the main being the second main. They're not big big, but a good portion. The calamari rings were well fried. Batter was relatively thin, smooth and lightly seasoned. The spicy black olive tomato sauce was a little too complex for this common dish though, which distracted from the flavours of the nicely done calamari. I ended up avoiding most of the sauce and went with just a small drible of lemon juice (which was a waste of the nicely done sauce which just didn't match the calamari that well).lightly fried calamari, spicy tomato sauce with black olives and capers...0lightly fried calamari, spicy tomato sauce with black olives and capers...The salad was (again) well proportioned (read: very big for an entree) and underlying flavour fresh . It was very salty though , and I would definitely ask for less salt next time (and encourage anyone else who orders this to request less salt as well, since they place a small cup of rough salt on your table anyway). I liked it if it was not for the saltiness. These entree portion sizes work great for sharing amongst a small group of up to four people.Italian chicories salad with cucumber and tomato, aged balsamic and olive oil...0Italian chicories salad with cucumber and tomato, aged balsamic and olive oil...The tomato basil pizza was juicy (and oily), and the crust and how it was put together made it a very satisfying pizza indeed. It's also well portioned.tomato, basil and fresh mozzarella pizza0tomato, basil and fresh mozzarella pizzaSpicy tomato meatball rigatoni was yum. It's been a while since I've had such a satisfying spicy tomato base. The meatballs were certainly a delight in terms of its texture (not too hard) and flavour (the beef was nicely seasoned that was juicy moist). Definitely my favourite in the meal. rigatoni and meatballs, smoked chilli tomato ragu0rigatoni and meatballs, smoked chilli tomato raguAs we were sharing, we each had an additional plate to our own. The staff helped change our plates and cutlery between entree and main automatically. This is excellent. It's important to avoid mixing flavours. For me, the calamari was dry and I had the salad on the plate it came with so it was a little unnecessary for myself, but it's certainly a great gesture and does keep things tidy if you had the salad on that plate of your own. They were also attentive enough to provide sharing cutlery without us asking.A small gripe is that the staff kept bumping into my chair ever so slightly. Of 10 passes, at least 8 if not 9 times they had caused me to feel my chair to wobble. This included who appeared to be the store manager in a suit, who was ever so kind to step aside and let another customer pass through at the 'T' junction (if I may call it that) when he bumped into my chair as he entered the 'side road'. None of the staff seem to notice though. Fine onece or twice, but doing so on every single pass is quite a record at any restaurant to be honest. During my hour there, they had passed at least 15-20 times. I was seated on the inside aisle between two of their oversized sharing tables.From the reviews, I came with an expectation of good ambiance and average food. The visit certainly exceeded my expectations.Supplementary Information""Two course"" lunch menu only allows entree and main (you can't choose main and dessert)",Mercato,4.2,220,nan,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-mercato/491473?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

Central,Italian,"0I had to make some serious decisions during my visit to New York, admittedly not life or death decisions, but important to me.So many restaurants and so little time meant that I had to carefully choose where I would spend my hard earned money. One of the very last nights left in Manhattan came down to a choice between three star restaurants, Daniel and Jean-Georges.Daniel won out on the day, but I'd always felt as if I'd missed out on something special.A couple of years down the track I learned that Jean-Georges was opening an outlet of his slightly more casual Mercato in Hong Kong and I was excited. I was finally getting to check out the fare of one of the United States' top chefs. So cool.Located in California Tower, one of LKF's funkiest buildings, I'd managed to sneak into Mercato at the right time. Not yet formally open and running through a soft opening month, I happened to dine on a day where Jean-Georges himself was hosting with some of his crew responsible for designing the restaurant and lighting.0Stepping out of the lifts and entering Mercato, I quickly noticed the lighting in the striking interior of the ultra chic restaurant. As it turned out, the lighting was one of the features of the Neri & Hu designed interior, and Jean-Georges had brought over the designer as part of the soft opening. He explained to me that the idea behind the lighting was designed to mimic the mood of the day - a bluish purple during the day and a funky red as the evening wore on.The interior was dominated by a bar at one end that stretched all the way up to the very high ceilings and an open kitchen at the other. Red brick gave an earthy feeling, that when offset by the dozens of hanging lights, provided a natural yet contemporary feel. I liked it and felt instantly at home.0I was quickly joined by a gaggle of other bloggers and all of a sudden it was time to eat, a selection of starters from the extensive modern Italian menu materialising magically at our table.My first bite of cuisine by Jean-Georges was the spicy tuna tartar with black olives, cucumber and avocado. Served in a deep bowl, contrasting colours from the pink tuna and green avocado enlivened the dish. The fresh tuna was lovely, especially when combined with the creamy avocado; puffed rice added some texture and a lovely little crunch in my mouth.0I moved quickly onto the salmon carpaccio, which was finished with olive oil, lime and a dusting of sea salt; yellow and purple edible flowers tactically placed on the plate helped the dish transform from food into edible art. The fresh salmon was sliced thin, yet still held a texture that was pleasant to eat. It was enjoyable on the whole, but when I had a mouthful with the added sea salt, the flavours really exploded in my mouth, so a little more of that seasoning would have really helped.0There was a strong bite from the endive and sugar snap pea salad that was both refreshing and memorable. On its own, the endive would have been too overpowering, but the addition of a parmesan dressing really helped balance the dish. I liked the simplicity of the dish, each piece of endive had it's own filling, so you just picked up the enclosed leaf and munched away.0Still keeping it very simple, an Italian chicories salad with orange and fennel was presented. I loved the bright orange sitting atop the salad, which was then finished with an aged balsamic. The sweetness of the orange matched perfectly with the bite of the chicories salad. It was the first time that I really paid attention to the crockery used at Mercato, the matt black of the plate helping the colours from the salad really dominate. It was a clever use of plating to enhance a simple salad.0In what felt much more like a dessert than a starter, one of Mercato's signature dishes was up next. House made ricotta with strawberry and garlic bread sticks made an interesting departure from the fresh crudo and salads that we'd been devouring to that point. The soft round ricotta cheese was topped with a strawberry jam, with the idea that the toasted garlic breadsticks be used to dip into the cheese. I'd been sceptical about the dish looking at it, but it worked really well. The sweetness of the strawberry working in harmony and the texture of the breadsticks giving a satisfying crunch.0As I'd been exploring the dining room before our meal, I'd noticed the wood fired oven in the kitchen, and knew that wood fired oven meant pizza. And what a pizza! Imagine adding black truffle to three different cheeses and then topping with a farm fresh egg. The smell was amazing! The aroma of the truffle was overwhelming and really made me want to dig in; so that's what I did. The egg was slightly oozy and the creamy yolk paired beautifully with the umami flavour of the truffle. A crisp base held it's shape as I quickly devoured my slices of the pizza. It was extremely memorable, especially since I'm a traditionalist and usually stick to a Margherita!0It wouldn't be a visit to an Italian restaurant without trying the pasta, the rigatoni with meatballs and a smokey chilli ragu. Fat and moist meatballs dominated the dish, but the tasty meatballs were ably supported by the perfectly cooked rigatoni. Interestingly, I found the chilli to be quite mild in the dish and found myself wanting just a little more heat to make the dish really exciting.0We were given a couple more of the Mercato signature dishes for mains. I thought that the porcini crusted salmon presented with a warm leek and lemon vinaigrette looked beautiful on the plate. I'd initially thought that the crust was the salmon skin, but as I bit into the salmon, tasted the earthy texture of the porcini crust. It was a little disconcerting but once my mind adjusted to the texture change, the earthy porcini played nicely with the slightly sweet salmon.0It was good, but the dish of the day had to be the crispy skin chicken with braided potatoes and lemon, which was simply divine. It looked more like a spatchcock due to it's size and the flesh was incredibly sweet, but what I really loved was the crispy skin that texturally and flavour wise was just super. I could totally understand why the chicken was one of the dishes that Mercato and Jean-Georges rate as the best!0It was time for dessert, and we were assaulted with a plethora of dishes that came out in rapid succession. Starting with an interesting take on a tiramisu, the simple looking dessert actually looked like an ice-cream sandwich, but the texture was soft and the flavours pure tiramisu. Chocolate, coffee and cream balancing together perfectly!0One of the more beautiful desserts I've seen for a while was the Italian cream cake with raspberry sorbet and fresh raspberries. There was a simplicity of the plate's design that added to its prettiness, as well as the symmetry on the pate, a berry coulis looking suspiciously like the Mercato logo design. The cake was moist, the sorbet sharp and a shard of tuile added texture. I really loved the dessert, but it wasn't my favourite.0That honour went to the home made mascarpone with macerated strawberries and young ginger granita, which was essentially a big pot of love strawberries and cream. The granita added temperature to the mix, so the creaminess of the mascarpone was offset by a super cold hit to the palate - tasty and refreshing!0All of the desserts from Mercato were visually stunning, I also loved the dark chocolate passionfruit tart with passionfruit sorbet; there was also a dessert that consisted of three scoops of peanut butter ice-cream in a pool of warm chocolate and finished with caramel covered popcorn. Yeah, the desserts at Mercato were pretty special!000The whole time we were at lunch, Jean-Georges was actively talking to all of the diners and doing a fantastic job of hosting the day. I was stoked to get a few minutes chatting to JG, who was clearly happy with the finish and design of his newest restaurant. I could tell he was proud of the restaurant, but he seemed most happy about the lighting!Soft openings are interesting affairs, usually in place to help the restaurant iron out any 'kinks' and ensure the full opening is a first rate affair for diners. As far as I could tell, the restaurant was running like a well oiled machine on the day of my visit, and I couldn't really pick on any issues at all. It would be interesting to see how the team would perform on a busy Friday night with a full house!My first experience of a Jean-Georges restaurant was a memorable one, good food, great environment and a quick conversation with the man himself. What more could you want?Well, as it turns out, I now have reservations about my decision to choose Daniel instead of Jean-Georges.... Ahh, it just gives me an excuse to get back to New York!@FoodMeUpScotty0We started with some soft bread with rosemary - with a peppery olive oil for dipping0Mercato has a special cocktail menu0I went for the Vodka Thyme and Lemonade 0This whisky based cocktail was a little too strong for some at the table!0There are a couple of different areas for dining at Mercato0Jean-Georges giving last minute instructions to the kitchen?0Restaurant Manager Romain B - a very good host!0Jean-Georges",Mercato,4.2,1000,nan,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-mercato/491473?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

I'll even forgo the quantity for it. What I got was neither of. A tiny, limp panini that was barely toasted assembled with minimal ham and mozzarella. It barely lined my stomach and it hardly sent my tastes buds into overdrive either. I've been to Italy enough times to know what a decent bit of ham and mozzarella sandwich.

The Drawing Room initially made waves in 2009 when it first opened in a small boutique hotel in Causeway Bay.

The Drawing Room quickly garnered accolades, a Michelin star and an extremely loyal and hungry following.

The service was efficient friendly and impeccable. The buffet lunch is very nice with a good spread of Italian dishes both meat, fish and vegetarian so plenty of options for all diners. Sadly the main courses were not up to scratch for expensive restaurant, the chicken was over cooked and dry. The fish was OK however the vegetables with it were bitter. The desert buffet was nice with nice selection of typical dishes including Tiramisu. Lunch was followed with a cappuccino which was at first bitter but was smoother as it was drunk, however in these days gourmet coffees the barista could have either put a pattern or made a tidier top the coffee, it gave one the impression it had bee rushed.

Central,Italian,"I came here with my cousin and her coworker for a farewell lunch. They were just searching through openrice and found this close by new Italian restaurant. We came here not knowing what to expect since it was so new. We arrived at around 12:30 (typical lunch hour) and immediately got seated. They had a set lunch which included soup of the day (today was mushroom soup), pizza or pasta starter, and then a main course, all for only 130! Considering it being located in Central, 130 for a 3 course meal was a steal! As we were skimming the menu trying to figure out what we should try, we came across an italian word which we were unsure of. We asked the waiter what it was and she brought us the a la carte menu which had the descriptions. After we figured out what it meant, the chef came out and personally greeted us and gave us a run down of the foods. When the starters came out the chef asked us what we would like to drink (which is also included in the meal!).I was sick so I couldn't drink anything cold, so I asked for a hot milk tea. Although it wasn't one of the drinks included in the set lunches, he happily made it for me. As we were enjoying our meal, the chef was hanging around and had a nice conversation. We learned about his background and joked around about a few things. He had such a wonderful time he offered us some free sample tiramisu! He said he was confident that it is the best tiramisu we were going to try in Hong Kong. When he brought it out his partner said that it was the best tiramisu ever. So we tried it and I have to say, it's pretty darn good. The texture of the cheese was extremely smooth. The biscuits on the bottom were still crispy and everything just melts together in your mouth creating one of the most incredible tiramisu tastes you will ever try. He invited us to the eventtonight at Castello. He is going to make mozzerella cheese right in front of the restaurant and then uses that freshly made cheese in the dishes at dinner. The event is tonight at Castello, there will be 3 sections 6:30, 7:30, and 8:30. The service is incredible, the food is delicious and the price is reasonable (for being in Central).

Central,Italian,"My friend Agent-I was back in town and I decided to bring her to Arcane where I haven't visited since its opening week last November. I must say, there was nothing really unpleasant from my previous visit but why didn't I return a bit earlier for another meal? 1Now my memory is coming back a bit. If there's one thing I found unsatisfied about my last visit at Arcane, it was the spacing in between tables. The space looked really small and a bit cramped as well. I didn't really want to listen in on my neighbors' conversation but I kind of had no choice. This time around, things were a little different coz the restaurant was less than half full and we were able to spread out a bit with empty seats surrounding us.0I recalled a second thing that was bothering me too - the menu. It has only 2 choices for starter, 2 for main course (a fish and a meat) and 2 desserts (with one being the cheese dish). This is definitely not very good news for anyone that wants plenty of choices.After a slice of bread, I started things off the same way I did last time with their poached taiyouran egg, shiitake duxelle, broccoli, brioche crumbs and onion seeds. I am not sure if this is Chef Osborn's signature dish or not but it's a fairly good way to kick things off here.0I ""destroyed"" the taiyouran egg with my knife and let the egg yolk float all over the rest of the ingredients. That was so good. I thought it tasted a tad better than last time.

It is like a reinterpretation of the Italian classics, paired with the parmesan cracker, basil sorbet and cherry tomato soup; the subtle peppery flavor of the basil complements the tuna very nicely. My bestie, on the other hand, got the Scallop with Watermelon Sauce and Cucumber Sorbet, which was equally lovely. The waiter told us that the chef pan-fried the scallop on one side, which gives a beautiful crisp on one side and a contrast of a soft scallop carpaccio on the other.

I usually do not eat raw eggs (and have a particular aversion towards raw egg yolk), but since the crust was quite dry, the runny yolks made each bite pleasantly moist, almost juicy, in a good way.The pizza base is not Neapolitan style.

Lets start off with Italian. When you first walk into Armani Aqua restaurant during brunch time, you can already see bunch of delicious Italian dishes. What i like to grab for Italian dishes are, Prawn And Mussel Platter, cause i love seafoods but except for the Fresh Oysters, reason why is because the oysters has too much sea water taste. For the rest that i like to grab from the Armani Aqua brunch Italian dishes is Octopus Carpaccio, Parma ham, smoked salmon, Italian platter and so on, they're all fresh. For the Japanese dishes that i like is Tofu bean curd, Udon noodles, of course Sushi and Maki and last but not least, Sashimi. They all taste fresh aswell. During brunch time they also have kids play room which is adorable. Its good that kids could play along than just sitting down. Kids can at least enjoy. But what i don't like is the table is too small. If im gonna add up some more food, the space isn't enough. So is with the Air conditioner. When its on, its too cold. But when its off, its too hot.

My pizza was nice and crispy, and the flavours were just right. It was not too oily which was nice, but I would have preferred if the mozarella on it was not just placed in small lumps on the pizza but maybe spread out a bit more so the flavour was more balanced instead of just biting into a bit of mozzarella.

There are a little garden with a lot of greens at the backyard, where is also a mini fresh food waste composting station. 1Lunch time is featured in semi-buffet plus selected main course style which is quite fit to the needs of people who are working around Central. 2-3 types of ham and cheese, grilled or fresh-mixed salads seasoned by olive oil and vinegar, etc; don't expect a huge selection of starters, but you will be satisfied by its qualified ingredients and flavor. 2Bronx PizzaThe New York style 18'' pizza is the new item with the renovation. It wowed us a lot not only by its huge size, but the attractive pizza top. Special meatball with the kitchen-producted pepperoni were 'printed' on the egg-yellow cheese & bloody tomato sauce layer; fresh herbs and thin slices of mozzarella balanced the flavor as well as the colorful looking. It's thin pizza but not in a super crispy and crunchy way; the heavy cheese and the heat made the huge triangle slice of pizza moisture and melted. It's an intensive taste; mild by the sauce meanwhile appetite-stimulating by the cheesy aroma and spicy sense.3Fragrant Grass Linguini with Parm Fonduta (back) & Fettucine Funghi (front)I became fettucine-lover since my first try in Rome, and I would like to give a 8/10 mark to Linguini Fini's Fettucine Funghi. I have successfully found the right chewiness and eggy aroma from their pasta; the losing 2 points would be counted to the heavy oily taste as my personal judgement. The milky-green color pasta, Fragrant Grass Linguini with parm Fonduta, was ranked as the top 2nd among the 4 pasta dishes we have tried that day. It's a really creamy texture all around the al-dente pasta, a light 'essential' of herb flavor mixed into the creamy-cheesy sauce completely and we could not have too much but tried our best to have more bites, just because of its deliciousness. 1Radiatore alla VodkaTop 1 coming  The Chef plays a game with traditional Italian pasta by adding spicy nduja laced cream sauce; by using this Italian pork spread (nduja) and leveraging the spices of it, the dish impressed us at our first bite immediately; it made your brain memorize this new special taste once your tongue absorbed those 'bio-chemical signals'. 2Apple Caramel Pie2Chocolate Banana CakeThe adding desserts were obviously in a New York style - big size, big taste! The apple pie was the rawest one I have seen in Hong Kong, with largely chopped apple. I love the thin and hard texture of pie with a strong butter aroma. The cake, was not that good-looking to be honest, but to a sweet-lover/chocolate-lover, it is definitely a 'eye-killer'. It tasted just like its melting look, very chocolate & banana in the very fresh way; the banana layer was so fresh that it was like I was having a bite of banana while drinking cold thick chocolate.Supplementary Information* No service charge* Lunch around $150 per head* Dinner around $350 per head* Weekday Happy Hour (5pm - 7pm): All-You-Can-Eat chicken wings & Free-flow PBR (beer)",Linguini Fini,3.8,150,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-linguini-fini/190645?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw
Central,Italian,"I always wanted to try this place after I read about it in a magazine describing it as a restaurant that served meatballs of all kinds. And more. I decided to try out them out for lunch on my day off.Layout is dark and quite bar/pub like. Dark wood tables and floors with black sofa seats. It felt like a great evening drinks type of place.During weekdays, they have a lunch set menu that costs $178 with no service charge (however, $1 is added to your bill to donate to a charity). It includes a starter, main, dessert and coffee or tea. Lunch crowd is well ... the place was empty except for another group. And this was 1 PM. So, if you want a quiet place for lunch, this is it.I decided on the quinoa salad for my starter and ultimate meatball sandwich for my main.1Bread platter with olive paste butter. Bread was presented to me on a pretty rectangular gray plate that looked like stone. Bread was ok. Nothing exciting about it. But what made this mind blowing was the butter. I normally don't like using butter on bread but I noted that there was this black ring around the butter patty. I wasn't sure what it was until I tasted it. It was black olive paste. When I spread it out with the butter on my bread, it took it to a whole new level. It was fragrant and .. blew my mind.bread with black olive coated butter0bread with black olive coated butterQuinoa with beetroot, baby spinach and goat cheese. I didn't expect the portions to be so huge. There was so much quinoa, it was a meal in itself. The goat cheese was creamy. Everything I love about goat cheese. The baby spinach was crisp and soft. The quinoa was light. The beetroot's tartness gave it a nice balance from the richness.quinoa salad0quinoa saladUltimate meatball sandwich with fries. Plated on a wooden chopping board for that rustic look. The first time I had a meatball sandwich was in this Italian deli in Little Italy area of Melbourne. It was the best thing I ever had in my entire trip to Melbourne. After that time, I've been obsessed with finding a great meatball sandwich. When I saw that Nom claimed to have the ultimate meatball sandwich, I had to try it out. Verdict? Not as good as the place in Melbourne, but pretty close. The meatballs were soft and cooked to a medium rare. It was packed with herbs. The tomato sauce was tangy and rich. It soaked into the soft sandwich bread. Biting in, cheesey strands strung out into my mouth. It was pretty good. The fries were super crispy and not oily. I love that they gave me a good small saucer plate full of ketchup.ultimate meatball sandwich0ultimate meatball sandwichLook how beautiful it looks inside!0NOM's signature ice cream sliders. Isn't this the cutest thing ever? Beautifully presented on a tiny cast iron plate, a tiny hamburger with a ball of ice cream with fried lotus root. Dusted with powdered sugar. The lotus root was crunchy like chips and great when I dipped them into the ice cream. The ice cream was vanilla in flavor and very creamy. It had a spread of yuzu in it which gave it a bitter tartness that balance all the sweetness. The burger bun was actually cake. This was not only cute but delicious.ice cream slider0ice cream sliderI was so full afterwards. I actually couldn't finish most of my meal. I was that full.

Central,Italian,"I just wanted to drop in and mention that Bistecca has the best semi-buffet lunch spread I've tried so far in Lan Kwai Fong. Souvla is probably the only other restaurant that comes close, in my experience.My friend and I randomly chose this restaurant out of the few in the same buildling. When we came it, it was quite busy but they still accommodated us in a table by the buffet table.The buffet was AMAZING! It was under HK$200 for buffet-only, and honestly I wish I just did that instead of adding a bit extra for the main.0I got a tuna steak but by the time they served it I was already super stuffed from the great selection they had. I had to take it away for dinner... that makes 2 meals in 1 day haha! The selections also had a lof of healthy options, I felt so good stacking my plate high with salads, roasted eggplants, etc. -- that actually tasted delicious.

Central,Italian,"Have been to this restaurnt dozens of times, almost always for lunch.A feature of this restaurant is that that there is a buffet anti pasti (or you can choose a soup or something else but most choose the buffet). The buffet also includes desserts.Noticed a couple of things - the menu has changed from a sheet of paper on a clipboard to (finally) a faux leather bound folder. Prices have gone up.The buffet seems to have gone down in quality compared to the past. There was the usual salads, lettuce, chick peas, cold pasta, sweet corn, cucumber, cold cuts, salami, proscuitto, fruit such as melon but quality seems to have gone down. The usual cheeses are there but the desserts of choclate cakes in small squares, blueberry cheesecake and apricot flan were tired and dry. The water melon was half red with the other half quite pale which looked less than appetising.The pleasant surprise was the main course, which was turbot. It came in small fillets, fried to a crisp perfection, presented well on a bed mash potatoes which was seasoned well.

Central,Italian,"Went for a late lunch so no booking or waiting required as it was 2 pm. Nothing really wrong with the food but it was just very so-so and underwhelming. Service not rude but underwhelming also. For the price and small portions, can do a lot better even in expensive Central.There were two of us and we ordered a vongole pasta each plus a pizza to share. The pizza had a soggy base, chewy but tasteless cheese and lots of grease at the bottom. The pasta dishes were not even hot but only room temperature which makes any dish difficult to please. Portion was small which in itself was not a problem. Did not bother with dessert that day.

Central,Italian,"0Foodie knows the key to a perfect bite, always stays with 'a bit' meat, 'a bit' cheese and 'a bit' well-done sauce. Who cares that a lot! Especially you know you will be treated with a rich selection of fine ingredients and a good cooking way. NOM, opened about 4 months ago, is kind of place I described above, and I'm very happy to listen to the Chef's words where I figure out the resto is proud of their qualified selection of imported raw materials (including vegetables) and the way they are making magic with those good ingredients in their secret kitchen.0Burrata | Heirloom Tomato | WatermelonThe main purpose for this visit is for their newly launched Lunch Menu, cost $178 (no service charge) which is only served in weekdays so far. Even you can find one item featured with their (already) famous Meanball, the new Lunch Menu actually has more highlight than where the fame is already. The power behind is, a double-fresh idea (to me), which stands for fresh ingredients plus fresh cooking.Of course, you could order from a-la-carte menu as you wish (but I would say their Lunch Menu setting is more than enough to feed you up). Burrata is one of those out of set menu. With a fresh and juicy companion of watermelon and tomato, we were swimming in the creamy, slightly sweet and milky Burrata (cream and mozzarella - inside part) without even a second of 'drowning'.0Roasted Pumpkin | Yogurt Dressing | Sharp Cheddar It's a fantastic but simply presentation with all my favorite ingredients, which I believe even you are piggy and insisting to healthy diet style, you won't say ""NO"" to this one. The roasted pumpkin cut into a cute large boat-shape which impressed me by its crispy hard biting experience; not flavored a lot even solidly whitened by yogurt dressing. It tasted amazingly light with a strong nuts aroma, and the only salty flavor came from the cheddar, which is hard, semi-dry, firm and of course, cheesy and delicious enough as its dry cheese way.0Quinoa | Beetroot | Baby Spinach0Sweet Potato | Sea weed salsa verde | Red onion | Oyster mushroomThe other two starters are awesome as well and as usual, to be a combination of healthy vegetables, lightly roasted and salad. To select any one out of those 3 starters, I would say nothing will go wrong whatever in its taste, presentation or physical diet theory, to color a little more about last point, is all of them are roasted, olive oil dressed, and contained enough fiber.0Ultimate Meatball SandwichOne of the main course choices and I'm pretty sure, if you go for this one to continue your Set Lunch in NOM, you will be over-satisfied in mind and by stomach. I simply love the way they are dealing with this Meatball Sandwich. The dry, crispy and awesome bread aroma, checked! The very-evil looking of meatballs and melted cheese 'coat', checked!The thin, light golden French fries, checked!A bite, I had a hint of fresh sweet tomato sauce in a right level of sweet and sourness to balance the meaty and cheesy side, juicy and soft pork & beef meatball, and the all-around cheesy taste, not too heavy nor too sticky, but just flowing everywhere.1Prawn SlidersAnother awesome dish from the regular menu is Prawn Sliders. The color wowed us a lot, and it is not difficult to have a successful guess about what's coloring those cute mini-bun. Yes, it's beetroot, a perfect healthy, sweetening and coloring ingredient. The mini-burger is not as heavy as sandwich, while in terms of that thick piece of pan-fried foie gras, the hidden fat you would take from it would be the same or even more. Anyway, it's delicious  The soft and smooth taste of prawn cake made with smashed potato and the full prawn instead of chopped or smashed ones. A rich flavor of juicy, rich and mouth-melting, but everything has a little connection with sweet, which makes a bite more complicated and interesting. The homemade chips are dressed with seaweed and salt.0New Zealand Short-RibsCompared to the outstanding Meatball Sandwich in the set menu, short-ribs might lose its glory. I'm not keen to its fat part so much, while the taste is not bad, mildly salted with a little smoked and roasted aroma.0Homemade Tagliolini | Crab Meat | Parsley Root PureeTime to take some traditional Italian food (pasta!) and I was again impressed. The homemade tagliolini is eggy, chewy and in a flat-shape but also twisted a bit itself. It is perfectly matched with the melted cheese on the top and parsley puree at the bottom. I really wish to have more bites but just too full already.0Ice-Cream SliderAnother slider, but in sweet way. It features Basil Cardamom Ice-Cream and Kumquat Cardamom jam, to give a very fresh mint-like taste. Perfect finishing after a big meal!Supplementary Information* Set Lunch $178 (no service charge) includes 3 courses & 1 coffee/tea",NOM  Not Only Meatballs,3.8,200,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-nom-not-only-meatballs/174224?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw
Central,Italian,"This is my favorite place for lunch in so-ho. $108 for 4 courses: soup/appetizer + mains + desert + tea. Cant find any place cheaper and better nearby.Living up to its name, Antipasto serves great appetizer. The complimentary crumble bread, served with their home-made spread, is superb. By itself, the bread is already filled with herbs. If you want to have more complexity in flavor, the spread will help you do the rest. Most importantly, all the bread is HOT.The formal appetizer is of high quality as well. Calamari salad, grilled fungi, bruschetta  they are all good. And the variety is wide. Their menus will change every week.The mains is good value for monies too. I love their pasta the most, as they are al dente and hot, not to mention rich in flavor (white wine/tomato/garlic). Nowadays, its really difficult to find authentic Italian pasta in Hong Kong. Either it was too tender or too cold. Having a piping hot dish of al dente pasta for lunch certainly satisfy my craving for carbohydrates. However, for the days I do not want to intake so much carbohydrates, I will pick their lamb/ chicken/ fish/ steak. I personally recommend lamb the most as it is always full of the unique flavor of lamb meat (some people may not be fond of it though).As to dessert, there is nothing to complaint about. It generally provides a perfect end to a satisfying lunch.This is a place that you just cant miss it!",Antipasto,4.1,120,nan,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-antipasto/48981?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
Central,Italian,"Nice place, prime location but quality of food can fluctuate.This restaurant has caught my attention quite some time ago but only now have I dared to brave the mixed reviews and sample what Lupa has to offer at lunch time.Decor and AmbienceDepending on where you sit, the ambience and the dining experience can vary quite a bit. Upon being greeted at the concierge, you are escorted along a corridor, with half-circle sofa tables on your left. If your seat is not one of those, there are quite a number of cafe tables and chairs in the main dining area. Rather clustered too. As people filled in the main dining area, the din can be quite affective if you're trying to strike a healthy conversation. There it feels like a noisy cafe or canteen. However if you were seated in the sofa tables along the corridor, as we were, the ambience is a bit classier and more private.FoodI've heard about the brunch buffet on weekends, but I didn't do my research thoroughly to investigate what they actually offer for lunch. (Or it wasn't immediately obvious from the first few pages of reviews on Openrice, no matter). For lunch on weekdays, most people would probably go for the lunch buffet which includes some selection of starters, salads, soup and dessert, plus a limited selection of pasta/pizza/mains with additional charge of up to $90. The basic lunch buffet was $188 or so, FYI.If you were more particular about food or can't be bothered to share the lunch buffet with us ""commoners"" you are welcome to choose a la carte from their lunch menu. I suspect this menu differs from their dinner menu, but should offer enough variety in any case.From the salad bar0From the salad barIn my honest opinion I do not think their salad bar is half bad. As compared to Gold by Harlan, or Bloom, the salad bar Lupa offers a more fullsome variety including seared tuna, some decent parma ham among other cold cuts, salmon, seasoned aubergines, pesto pasta salad, cubes of cold quiche, olives etc. (8/10 - the way salad bar goes)Seafood penne0Seafood penneOur meal was going fine until this penne. Quite disappointed to find it lacking heat, which is quite a no no for seafood (frozen) obviously. The pasta was probably homemade, which is encouraging but also gives for less quality control I believe. The textureis unlike any other penne I've had, it's almost crispy, crunchy. Which is so unconventional for pasta and penne....Not sure what to make of this.It's not your usual al dente, nor was it uncooked. (6.5/10)Gnocchi with oxtail ragout and ricotta cheese0Gnocchi with oxtail ragout and ricotta cheeseI really like this dish and so would you if you, like me, love pasta sauce more than pasta, as well as comfort food like mac n cheese. A critic would probably say the proportion of oxtail ragout vs gnocchi is a bit too much, indeed there is as much oxtail meat/sauce as there are gnocchi. But that's fine with me I like wet and soft foods. Thesoftness is another thing that strikes me. The gnocchi probably shouldn't have been so soft as baby mush...but I liked it for what it was. At least it's got individuality lol. (8/10)DessertNeglected to take pictures of the bit size cakes and desserts from the buffet table. Nothing worth noting anyway. But I do appreciate the cheeses they had. (7/10)ServiceTheir service was quite good and professional. Exceeds the quality of the food in fact.

Central,Italian,"Didn't book in advance, as some people evidently did. Nevertheless they were able to serve us at approximately 1 pm, and I am thankful for that. Come for a simple lunch, or when you itch for pasta - the staple comfort food that cheers up the soul.DecorIf you've been to any of the many restaurants in The Loop you would have a sense of what Sagrantino looks like. A long corridor with tables on either side, and then a slightly bigger area at the back. Sagrantino emulates a casual Italian-Asian vibe, nothing that gets you worked up or anxious about protocol.FoodI have not had the chance to sample their a la carte menu items yet, but having had a brief look at their menu I would want to try for example the Avocadonara pasta, or the squid ink risotto. (On that note please do correct the spelling mistake of ""rissoto"" at the entrance).We tried their lunch menus, and contrary to what my fellow reviewers said the portions are certainly sufficient. It may be that if you ordered the ""grill"" items you would leave half-full, but with pasta, good old dependable pasta, they serve you just the right amount.The soup we had, potato soup, was just alright. Not an expert on this so am just mentioning it in passing.Pollo - chicken heart and kidney in cream sauce - Yumm...0Pollo - chicken heart and kidney in cream sauce - Yumm...Pollo (chicken heart, [liver] and kidney)I'm not a squeamish person for organs, if you are, don't read this paragraph. Organs have been used in European cuisines for a variety of dishes, yes, the ""civilized cultures"" eat them too. I've had calf liver, whole, grilled or seasoned somehow in Edinburgh (though even I can't finish it, just too much!). Chinese of course, love organs. I've never had pasta with the organs in such wholesome pieces though. In my opinion, the penne with creamy, cheesy sauce is just nicely complemented by chewy and flavourful organ morsels. Rated 7.6/10.Salsiccia - with Italian sausage and red wine sauce - Interesting...0Salsiccia - with Italian sausage and red wine sauce - Interesting...Salsiccia (Italian sausage and red wine sauce)What's striking about this pasta sauce is that it does taste strongly of red wine minus the alcohol. Interesting take on a red, tomato base sauce. Didn't sample the sausage can't comment on that. Rated 7.5/10.Generally, their pasta needs an additional dash of cheese, and only if they automatically served the grated Parmesan along with the pasta.The drinks that come along with the lunch set are BLEH.ConclusionAs titled, this is a good place to come for comfort food, and where you have a limited lunch hour. Not bad for its value too, a pasta lunch set costs $118 with 10%.

Central,Italian,"Usually I try to steer clear of American-Italian dining places here. Their overpowering ketchup-like red sauce and the sticky, over-creamy white sauce are too dreadful for me. The only saving grace is the association of these eateries with my favourite movie series ""Godfather"", in which there are always scenes of mafia members enjoying a plate of pasta in the midst of chaos and bloodshed. 0I have walked past this place many times before and was drawn by its subdued yet classy decor and high ceiling, but it was always full. This time I deliberately went there after busy lunch hours and was whisked to a table right away.At the corner of the menu it is written ""Posto Pubblico uses organic and natural farm-fresh produce sourced locally from Homegrown Foods...""and on their website it says:""ALL OUR MEATS, POULTRY AND EGGS ARE HORMONE FREE AND ALL DISHES ARE PREPARED WITHOUT MSG TO BRING YOU HEALTHIER, EXCITING MEALS EVERYDAY""I guess at least I have to appreciate the place for this.0The price for drinks are a bit on the high side.

The sauce was a little too bland, and the meat was a little too rubbery. For me western meatballs is no way on the same pedestal as our Chinese counterparts. Then came the much pleasant surprise - bucatini all'amatriciana ($155) (""alla gricia"" - a ""white"" sauce of pancetta and pecorino - is also available with this pasta at same price). I always applaud myself for being ""open-minded"" despite my perception for certain types of food or restaurants (ha ha!). The tomato sauce for this dish was far more sophisticated with the right balance of sweetness and tanginess. It was a beautiful pasta dish which felt wholesome.Linguini Vongole, white ($160)0Linguini Vongole, white ($160)I was torn between red and white sauce for this dish as I really can't stand the sticky cheesy American style white sauce. But finally I succumbed to the waiter's recommendation and it turned out that I really wanted to kiss him on the cheek. The clams were fresh and plentiful, and much to my delight, the sauce was more of a clear, white-wine based one infused with the natural juice of the fresh clams. We loved this linguine alle vongole so much that we went for a second order. The second dish was as nice as the first one, which may mean the place does make delicious pasta and is not a fluke at all.This place will pop up in my mind whenever I have a yearning for reasonably-priced, nicely-cooked linguine alle vongole.",Posto Pubblico,3.3,250,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-posto-pubblico/38508?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

Central,Italian,"After finishing my latest watercolor portrait (which took me 50+ painful hours to do so), I decided visit the art galleries and the small streets in Soho on a Monday morning. Despite being a symbol of the swanky boisterous nightlife side of Central, Soho is actually a very quite and peaceful area in daytime. The sharp visual contrast between the exotic, extravagantly furnished bars and restaurants and the shabby historic neighborhood seems to be blurred under the same peacefulness. Simply seeing the streetviews made me I feel extremely refreshed and content. After the relaxing walk, I decided to have my lunch in Cenacolo. The restaurant is pretty quiet and cozy. It was around 12:30 pm when I went in there and there were only around 3 to 4 tables of customer. Just like most of the western restaurants nearby, Cenacolo provides weekday 3-courses lunchsets including an appetizer, a main course, and a drink or dessert. I chose smoke salmon with mixed salad for the appetizer, mushroom risotto for the main, and iced coffee for the drink. A bread basket was served after I ordered. It was one of the best bread baskets I have ever tried in Hong Kong! The bread was warm. It's crispy on the outside, and instead of having the usual soft or chewy bread texture on the inside, it had a moist and dense texture almost like that of a pound cake. The bread had a rich flavor of fresh herbs. It was a bit too salty alone but it tasted just right after dipping into the balsamic vinegar and olive oil. bread basket and salad0bread basket and saladThe salad was fresh but it didn't made a strong impression. The smoke salmon was of average quality. The vinaigrette dressing wasn't enough.After finishing the salad, the risotto was served. The risotto was cooked in perfect timing which gave the rice a chewy uncooked texture. It was served with a generous amount of porcini mushrooms. However, the sauce wasn't rich and creamy enough (at least for me).

Nothing on the drinks menu looked interesting as I don't drink alcohol on my own and I didn't want coffee as I was meeting a cousin for afternoon tea later so I asked for a glass of water.Bread was given along with a bottle of olive oil and balsamic vinegar. There was no plate for me to dip the oil/vinegar mixture. Where was I to do this? Pour it straight onto my bread? The bread was also cold and hard.

And for some of you who are searching for some true italian comfort food, spend some time to visit the Paisano's Pizzeria.It's not occasionally that i want to eat pizzas, at least not once a week, but when i do, i want good quality pizza and it seems that i have found the right place. The kind of pizzas and pasta that i uasually face are ones that has a relatively samll size (pizza hut), they generally taste badThe big glass window0The big glass windowRegarding the exterior of the paisano's pizzeria, don't be fooled by its fast-food restaurant outlook, the culinary experience that you get is far better from pizza hut. The interior is simple, conjuring a confort sense upon the visitors, allowing them to enjoy the food. One of the spotlights in the restaurant is the glass window housing all the pizzas and pastas. All of those pizzas are REALLY LARGE, i can promise you that you have never seen such a large pizza. They support a lot of different sauces and toppings, but they also have defaults one. I had a hard time picking one and i landed on the hawaii pizza, the classic one with pineapple and ham. I was very lucky to, by coincidence, had fresh batch of pizza. They sell them really quick and pizzas come flowing out of the kitchen.Although they sell REALLY LARGE pizza, people usully buy individual slices. I know some people don't prefer that and want individual samll pizzas, but i find it interesting and iots one of the things that make this restaurant shine. They offer differnt kinds of combo, especially in lunch sessions, to suit those buisness men.hawaii pizza0hawaii pizzaWhen it comes to pizzas, the base, the topping and the sauce makes the key of a pizza. Generally, i prefer a thin base, as i love it crispy. However, it thin base generally equals to dense dough. Suprisingly, the outside of the base is crsip and the inside is moist and fluffy. The sauce is ???OK???, very simple tomato sauce. The topping is good. Another bright side is the cheese, which lifts the whole pizza together.

Eggs were of good quality and cooked to perfection.The biggest disappointment was the ordered pasta and pizza.I have tried several times there before I reached this conclusion.Don't get me wrong, the pasta tasted fine but it was simply not that Italian. Perhaps I should remind myself that this place came from New York.The tomato sauce was lack of delicacy and the right balance of sourness and sweetness.0The pizza base was delicious, though the filling and the tomato sauce were again a disappointment.I still cannot grasp the logic of putting shitake mushroom onto a funghi pizza.

Central,Italian,"I knew it would be a bad idea when I walked in on a Sunday 1 pm and the restaurant was completely empty. But I was hungry and in the mood for a nice lunch. I had visited the place before a few times on working days, and those times were decent. So I figured weekend would be the same. I have never been so wrong before in my life. My main course was the beef short ribs ($228). The menu said slow cooked, but either the beef was extremely old, or their cooking method involves boiling all the moisture out of the meat, slowly and agonizingly. I did try to save it. I asked for more sauce (there were a few desultory drips on the plate) but the waiter said they had no sauce left. Errr okay. They had mustard which didn't help. Hot sauce on tough meat (short rib is supposed to be soft by definition) wasn't any good. I ended up returning most of it to the kitchen. I've almost never done that before. And it made me whip out the phone and write this review, and I haven't written any Openrice reviews in a very long time.

Perhaps it's because the brownie itself is already really rich, and they didn't want the ice cream to add an extra dose of guilt.

When I made the reservation, I clearly indicated I want a baby chair and the person didn't tell me it was not an option.We ordered a pasta for the baby, fish + soup set for my wife and buffet + risotto for myself.To our pleasent surprise, the pasta for the baby arrived by the time I had walked over the the buffet and brought some apps. Soon I found out why--the pasta was simply undercooked. al dente is one thing, doughy & hard is another.We called our waitress and said its under cooked and she apologised and took it away and within a minute, brought another one. And it was just as bad.Then came the risotto--it was just as undercooked. Basically hard rice. On the plus side, both my wifes soup and fish were good.I called the manager and sent both the pasta dishes back. I don't think anyone in the kitchen is capable of cooking any types of pasta.They charged me 378 for the app buffet which I think is a total rip off as you can get much better buffet for the price. some cold cuts and cheese and a few salads and deserts don't warrant that price imho.

Central,Italian,"On Christmas Eve, we met up with a friend at Linguini Fini for lunch. The restaurant was located on the first floor at The L Place, and our initial impression was how messed up the access was. The elevators we got on did not go to first floor so we had to get off the second floor at The Salted Pig and walked down the stairs from there. The staff at The Salted Pig seemed pretty used to it as they automatically gave out directions.Once we finally got to the restaurant, the place was bustling and chatty with its casual ambiance. We were led to our table which was rather small even for 3 people, and I had originally made the reservations for 4. The set lunch was simple with 2 courses for $118. The starters included salad, soup or tripe while for mains, you can choose any of their signature pasta or the beef brisket.1Their signature pasta had 6 choices which included the pomodoro, aglio olio, puttanesca, genovese, goat cheese fonduta, and diavola. You can order pizza, antipasta, or salad from their a la carte menu as well. J and I choose to order the set lunch as that seemed to be a good deal.0After we placed our orders, bread was brought out in a rather cute tin can. Too bad the bread was cold though so it was just alright to nimble on. The olive oil provided was just average as well - not really fragrant or flavorful enough.08 Hour Tripe (4/5) - the tripe was very tender and soft to eat. Although, it kind of reminded me of chinese braised beef tripe but swapped out with tomato sauce instead. The result was eerily familiar yet different. It worked for me!8 Hour Tripe08 Hour TripeRoasted Pepper & Eggplant Soup (3/5) - the soup was hot which was well appreciated. The taste was a bit bland and watery though. A bit more seasoning would have helped.Roasted Pepper & Eggplant Soup0Roasted Pepper & Eggplant SoupGenovese (4/5) - spaghetti wtih basil pesto sauce. The pasta was alright but not quite al dente. The pesto sauce was fresh and flavorful albeit a tad oily. The cherry tomatoes were very sweet and refreshing though!Genovese0GenoveseBeef Brasato(2/5) - braised beef brisket with marscapone polenta, fennel and onion salada. The portions were big but beef brisket was a bit lean and tough. The flavors were one-dimensional and heavy. I wasn't so hot on the polenta which was thick and bland. The whole dish was too much to absorb as it was pretty oily as well. A disappointing dish on the whole.Beef Brasato1Beef BrasatoWhen we were got the check, a card was placed on our table to inform us that this restaurant does not automatically charge 10% service charge. Rather, they believe that customers should tip what they want - which was refreshing as many restaurants especially those serving western food adds 10% to the bill and we pay up without batting an eye.0Conclusion - the food at Linguini Fini was average while the value for money was marginal for me. The prices were alright given it's in Central I guess. My friend said that the dishes here can be a hit or miss depending on what you pick, and given its inconsistencies, I'm not sure I would come back to take my chances.

Central,Italian,"Japanese style pasta.Interesting menu.Small portions and a bit pricey.Comfy tavern-like environment.  Decor & menu:The whole place was like a tavern with a lot of natural light. The tables were spaced reasonably apart. Comfy sofa. 90% of the customers were girls, which perhaps explains the better ambience.This restaurant is a Japanese Italian fusion restaurant. They serve Japanese style pasta with interesting toppings like sunagimo (chicken kidney), motsu and pork ribs. They also serve vongole and carbonara...etc. The chef here have worked/trained in southern Italy. I believe their signature dish is a cold tomato pasta with scallops. There is also a limited amount of steaks and lamb chops.Each set came with either a soup or a salad and a drink. We ordered a salmon pasta, sunagimo pasta, motsu pasta and a diced lamb. The price range was around $100-$150.First came the breadsticks. Those were really crunchy. Vongole Carbonara  Gnocchi.  ...0 Vongole Carbonara  Gnocchi.  ...Soup:  - 0 - Potato Soup. It was rather creamy but the texture was extremely light. I prefer more potato chunks like potato and leek soup. I've had more westernized version even in Japan.Diced lamb: ($158) - 2...0 - 2...I ordered medium. The diced lambs had decent lamb taste. The portion, however, was extremely small. It felt like just one piece of lamb chop diced. The diced potatoes with herbs were slightly browned, which was a nice touch but again, the portion was extremely small. I was just 20% full after having the whole thing. My wife thought I took the photo after I've had some.The gravy was very rich and creamy. I have to say the gravy was the highlight of the meal. It would be great if there was a piece of bread to go with the gravy.Perhaps I can't help staying foolish, but staying hungry is certainly not my philosophy. Halfway during my meal I was already thinking of having a wonton noodle around the corner.$158 plus service for this is too pricey.Pasta:al dent. T...0al dent. T...Perhaps I should have ordered pasta. With one exception (the salmon pasta), the ladies seemed to be happy with the Sunagimo (chicken kidney) pasta and the Motsu (beef tripe) pasta. The Motsu pasta used ponzu and a lot of parsley as the base.I had a little bit of pasta and a sunagimo. I found the sunagimo rather tough and the pasta even tougher. Just slightly better than ' Te'. Having said that, Japanese style pasta is usually much tougher than its European counterpart.The dinner menu, with pizza and other more 'orthodox' Italian dishes, looked more appetizing.No complaints about the service.Conclusion:Two voted for the pasta and one voted against. About the diced lamb, the sauce was quite impressive. The quality of the lamb was alsodecent. However, the portions were too small for me. All in all, the verdict for this shop is: OKHaving said that, I won't rule out another visit to try their cold pasta though.Suitable for those with small appetites who prefer a comfy environment for a chat & a light meal.

Central,Italian,"On the surface, L'altro has all the fixtures of a nice restaurant from the sleek decor to the fancy platings. Since I was staying in town over the holiday break, I decided to make reservations at several Michelin restaurants I wanted to try and L'altro was one of them. Whenever possible, I'd like to make reservations online and this restaurant had that capability. I made the reservation online by filling out their form, and got a call shortly confirming my reservation. Nice~Located at The L Place, the restaurant was bright and airy during the day and had a view over The Center. The decor was sleek and modern with minimal colors except for the festive decorations. An impressive series of wine refrigerators took up one side of the restaurant.00Our table happened to be right next to the Christmas tree! How festive! We were given a rather large table that can seat 4 people even though there were only 2 of us. It may be because the restaurant was actually not that full at all during lunch time.0The lunch menu was pretty simple with 2 courses at $268, 3 courses at $298, 4 courses at $398. We each picked the 3 courses with a starter, main, and dessert. When I asked the waiter to explain some of the items on the menu to me, he just sort of recited the menu which wasn't that helpful. We also noticed some wrong spellings on the menu (like the word potato), which is not a big deal but it does reflect on the attentiveness of the restaurant.1Bread Basket - our bread basket was plentiful and most importantly - hot. No olive oil or balsamic vinegar was given however. Not an issue as each of the bread was pretty flavorful. The tomato bread roll had bits of dried tomato bits as an added texture. The rosemary bread roll was fragrant and tasty. The sourdough wheat bread was tangy and refreshing to eat.0The starters came out rather quickly after we ordered.Slow Cooked Japanese Egg, Delicate Salad and Mustard Dressing(3/5) - the slow cooked Japanese egg was buried in the middle of the salad, which was cooked nicely as it was soft and liquidy. The salad was fresh but the flavor of the dressing was not apparent. We could not taste it at all and depended on the egg as condiment. A so-so and bland dish overall.Slow Cooked Japanese Egg, Delicate Salad and Mustard Dressing...0Slow Cooked Japanese Egg, Delicate Salad and Mustard Dressing...Panfried Baby Squid, Datterino Tomato Coulis and Cous Cous (4/5) - loved the bright colors of the plating of this dish. The squid was nicely panfried as it was slightly crispy on the surface. It could be fresher though. The couscous was light and grainy, and went well with the tomato puree sauce.Panfried Baby Squid, Datterino Tomato Coulis and Cous Cous...0Panfried Baby Squid, Datterino Tomato Coulis and Cous Cous...After the starters, it started to go downhill as we had to wait 20-30 minutes for our mains.Parma Ham and Ricotta Tortelli with Consomme (1/5) - what a disappointment! When this finally came, we noticed a strand of hair on one of the tortelli. We had to send it back of course but no apology was given. We waited another 10 minutes for the new dish to arrive. The consomme was poured on the spot. Unfortunately, it was way too salty! The parma ham was really salty while the skin of the tortelli was thick and hard. The portion was also pretty pitiful with only 4 small pieces.Parma Ham and Ricotta Tortelli with Consomme0Parma Ham and Ricotta Tortelli with ConsommeKurobuta Milanese, Curry Potato Mash and Chips (3/5) - this was highly recommended by the waiter. The plating was again very pretty with the contrasting colors and symmetrical positionings. Too bad the pork was a bit tough and bland. It was not tender at all. The potatoes were tasty though especially the purple colored chips. Again, pretty small portions with only 2 pieces of cubed pork.Kurobuta Milanese, Curry Potato Mash and Chips0Kurobuta Milanese, Curry Potato Mash and ChipsFinally the desserts came out quickly after we finished our mains.Figs and Vanilla Pannacotta +$28 (4/5) - the desserts here were probably the highlight of our meal. The pannacotta was rich with vanilla flavor while the pastry base was buttery and crunchy. The figs were also sweet and delicous to eat.Figs and Vanilla Pannacotta0Figs and Vanilla PannacottaGelato Miramonti (4/5) - I had read that this dessert was highly recommended but it didn't arrive in a little mountain as others have experienced. It came in a martini glass with some chocolate syrup poured at the table. No biggie. The gelato was silky smooth while the chocolate was slightly bitter, which nicely counterbalanced the sweetness of the gelato.Gelato Miramonti0Gelato Miramonti0Conclusion - my dining experience at L'altro was disappointing to say the least.

Central,Italian,"Late Sunday afternoon lunch with the girlfriends. I ordered their signature Tartufo and a Cappuccino.First of all, the service was a real letdown. The lady at the cashier seemed to deliberately avoid making any eye contact - much less smiling - and stared grumpily at her cash register, answering our simple question of whether any set menu was offered and whether soy was available for the coffee with dour ""No""s. Seriously, maybe one would expect such service at Lin Heung Teahouse, but an Italian cafe at IFC? Thus began a bad experience.Tartufo: To be honest, I couldn't understand what the fuss on this was about. The bread was decently crispy, but parts were made soggy by the olive oil dressing, and it was definitely not piping hot as hoped, but rather lukewarm. The parma ham was good and not overly salty, which tends to be a problem for parma ham sandwiches. Two miserable extremely thin slices of brie were given, and tasted as though they had been left at room temperature for a tad too long. The serving was large, around 20% larger than an ideal lady's size, although probably just right for the gentlemen. In summary, the taste was not memorable, and although better quality than Pret, certainly not deserving of a $88 price tag.Cappuccino: To give the place some credit, this was quite well done, and even a bit chocolatey (more sweet than bitter, so may suit those with a preference for sweetness and less acidity). It came with a tiny bit of chocolate covered ice cream which was a pleasant touch. However, the serving was definitely on the small side, about half the amount of a regular Starbucks cappuccino (closer to a babyccino size).If you wanted a quick sandwich, I'd suggest Pret offers better value for money. The only plus about this place, other than the bad service and disappointing food, is that the ambience is actually quite nice with the natural light streaming in from IFC's glass roof and high ceilingsSurprisingly uncrowded for a weekend lunch, which suggests that I'm not the only (or first) one to find the experience disappointing!",Panino Giusto,2.6,130,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-panino-giusto/151120?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

The restaurant is Ciak. Furnished with an organic wooden interior - light birch walls and dark walnut colored furniture; having a spacious, well-lighted dining area; and with the smell of gorgeous cooking wafting through the open kitchen; this cozy new restaurant has the makings of a star.00Whether deliberate or not, it is refreshing to see Ciak bring back the supermarket hertitage of the space in the form of an Italian grocer plus restuarant. More exciting still is the involvement of Umberto Bombana, of Otto e Mezzo BOMBANA and Toscana fame, as chef and culinary advisory.My first visit was on a weekday afternoon, booked by my friend right after I saw it. The restaurant was already buzzing with people when we arrived. The waiters were courteous and seemed to know many of the diners there, which I pressume have just been to the pre-opening. Service was fast and friendly.We both chose from the set menu ($238 each), opting for each a starter and a main.0The classic minestrone soup with pesto sauce I had was an eye-catching hue of green, and seemed too bland on the first few sips. The flavor got progressively better as I reached the bottom of the bowl (or more appropriately, pot). I would say the taste is warm and well-balanced, a good soup for the warmer seasons; but I personally prefer its more hearty traditional version.0The beef tongue with tuna sauce worked well for my friend. The thinly sliced meat was garnished with dollops of creamy tuna and topped with arugula. A healthy starting choice.Wonderful charcoal flavors0Wonderful charcoal flavorsFor the main, mychar-grilled U.S. sirloin steak with argula salad did not disappoint.

The meat was tender and juicy, complimented by a tasty gravy and roasted potatoes.Simply amazing pasta1Simply amazing pastaMy favorite dish was the lasagette with homemade sausage mushroom and mozzeralla, which I sampled in large forkfuls of it off my friend's plate. The pasta was cooked al dente and you can still taste the floury scent; my guess is that it is freshly made in store (to verify next visit).

Central,Italian,"Probably my favorite food is the sandwich. Even when I think of other things I like-- say fried things-- if you put them on a sandwich they're even better.One of the disappointing things about Hong Kong is a lack of sandwiches. Scratch that-- it's not that there aren't sandwiches, it's just that they're not any good (exception: Fresh in LKF). But I had heard that Paisano's has good sandwiches, so I made the trek to the escalators today to give it a go.First, some background. I'm very picky about mayonnaise. I don't ever like there to be a lot of it on something-- things that have too much mayonnaise are gross-tasting and inedible to me. Second, I like mayonnaise on very few things. In particular, I can't stand it on anything with beef or pork (hamburgers, roast beef sandwiches, ham sandwiches...). And I don't like it on anything hot, like a burger or a toasted sandwich. Warm mayo turns my stomach.I understand that not everyone shares my distaste for mayo. That's fine, but I like it (a) when I'm informed about whether something has mayo on it and (b) when I can request and receive no mayo. I've in the past complained about ""sneak attack mayonnaise"" where mayo is not listed on the menu, but it comes on the item (usually a burger) anyways. I don't like that.I was pleased that Paisano's is clear that their sandwiches come with mayonnaise. I was also pleased that the woman who took my order accepted my request for ""no mayonnaise."" I was not pleased when the sandwich came:Mayo0MayoHopefully you can make this out in the picture. That's the sandwich slathered in mayonnaise right next to my receipt that reads ""no mayonnaise."" I could have returned the sandwich, but it took them 15 minutes to make it, I spent 15 minutes walking there and 5 minutes in line, and I really didn't have another 15 minutes to wait for them to make another one. I have a job.It's jaw dropping that a pizza restaurant, of all places, cannot handle special requests. What if you want extra cheese or onions on only half the pizza? Can they do that? It doesn't seem so.Paisano's Super Sub0Paisano's Super SubThe super sub comes with ham, genoa salami, mortadella, and provalone. The Italian meats are very good, though a little bit salty. Provalone is one of my favorite sandwich cheeses.On top of the meats is a salad of lettuce, tomatoes, pepperoncinis, black olives, and onions. It has Paisano's ""secret sauce,"" which is a funny way to spell ""oil and vinegar."" In fact, there's so much secret sauce that while eating, my plate collected a big pool of oil and vinegar.The bread was plain white bread. Nicely toasted, but not at all impressive.I don't know what I would have rated the sandwich if it had come without mayo, as I requested. Maybe I would have liked it. But globs of warm mayo all over cured pork? I couldn't eat it. I ate maybe half my 6-inch sub. It was just so unappetizing.

I never expect dish presentation when coming to a home style restaurant, yet what I always expects and discovered was the consistance quality and pleasant smile for the waitress. There is one dish wish I always order for first time visitor to this restaurant, Linguini Marinara. If you love Linguini and Shell fish, this is the Must have dish, you can taste the ocean combined with fresh herb in every juice bite. The size of this dish is the most generous, recommended for sharing. I will get a picture of this dish up running soon. Pizza, never short of Cheese on top just like what mum would do for her son, Rich and creamy on top of the freshly hand made dough. My person favorite is the Quatro Stagiani, four topping including Artichoke hearts, toasted Mushroom, baby tomato and ham. Lover of spicy food myself would usually add a few drops of Tabasco sause and spice it up. Till today, La Piazzetta is still the only Italian restaurant in HK that surves Tiramisu with Marsala wine upon request, Tiramisu is prepared homestyle, the authentic display brings you right back to the street of Italy. I love the location, because because its quiet, I could hear myself without shouting. I trust the food here because most of the key ingredients are direclty imported for italian family food maker with generations of history in delivering nothing but homestyle, something different from most of the other Italian restaurants in town, 100% of the wine carried in here are imported from Italy.Supplementary InformationCertified with Italian Authentic Dining Restaurant in HK for 18 yrs",La Piazzetta,4.6,120,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-la-piazzetta/1788?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw
Central,Italian,"This is actually my second visit to L'altro, since my last lunch here was rather rush, but the burrata with tomato cream had left me with a strong impression, I decided to return and had a relaxing lunch during my holiday.Seated at the corner, it was a rather quiet corner that I had it all to myself, and perhaps because of this corner, servers were rather non-attentive that I had to hold my hand up for quite a while before they noticed me. I asked about the Risotto of the Day,but did not receive a satisfactory answer - 'risotto with a kind of white fish with cream sauce'. Given it was a michelin starred restaurant, I reckoned the minimum requirement would at least have the server telling me what kind of fish would be served, how it would be cooked. Finally,I opt for the 3-course option and was served with the bread basket. I especially liked the sun-dried tomato one though its aroma was stronger its taste.0Bread Basket0Bread BasketSun-dried tomato bread0Sun-dried tomato breadMy appetizer was presented to my table not long after I started nibbling my bread. It wasTomato 'panzanella', buffalo mozarella and 36 months cured ham.Tomato with mozarella was my usual choice for appetizer, and it came in a lovely twist! Panzaella is a Tuscan salad of soft bread and tomatoes. The bread was soaked with different kinds of seasonings, like onions, olive oil and vinegar. I could literally taste the 3 layers separately, first the panzanella with tomatoes, then the mozarella started to take over my tastebud, and at the final bites, I could smell and taste my ham. It was a lovely idea to add the cured ham onto the appetizer, which was indeed a good alternative to the more common Insalata Caprese. It did not make it a heavier dish but brought out the essence of the fresh mozarella and tomatoes.Tomato Panzanella, with buffalo mozarella and parma ham...0Tomato Panzanella, with buffalo mozarella and parma ham...Even when the server did not give a descriptive elaboration on the Risotto of the Day, I wanted to be adventurous and had it for my main. It was OK, the fish meat was rather tender, with crispy skin and the oil and juice in the fish was well preserved in the meat. The risotto was slightly too cheesy for my liking. I could only finish half of it since I needed to save some space for dessert.1As for dessert, of course I chose the famousGelato Miramonti.The first time I came, it arrived on a wheeled table like an ice-cream mountain which was served later on a martini glass with strawberrie. Not sure if it was because this is rather time-consuming or there was not enough servers on duty, the gelato was just presented on the martini glass right away and brought to my table. I was a little disappointed that consistency was not kept. Well, the gelato still tasted awesome, it was silky smooth with a strong egg and milk flavor.Miramonti Ice-cream0Miramonti Ice-creamTo me, dining consists of both food and service. If the 'showcase' of gelato had never been performed, there would not be any disappointment. Plus if it targets the fine dining sector, I reckon servers should be able to give a richer elaboration on the dishes. If it is really hard to memorize everything, little cards with explanation could be printedand shown on the tables. Overseas first class restaurants are already doing that and it is not anything new. Not only should a great restaurant keep up with its food quality, but it should also maintain at least the same service quality every time a diner visits or re-visits the place.",L'aLtro,3.7,370,nan,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-laltro/110195?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

The lighting is great for any occasion although it makes reading the menu slightly difficult, you'll find that it's bright enough for everything else.I was wowed by the decor and ambience; it's a very nice area and it's well complimented by the 5-star service.I found watching the waiters go around the restaurant with an iron to iron the table cloths very amusing, and it's one of the quirks that Lupa has to offer.The buffet food was alright, I personally didn't find anything special about it all and found the fungi pizza we ordered with the buffet slightly fatty, although the crust was divine. They were also generous with the toppings which was probably why I found it a bit 'fatty' (there was a lot of cheese). I'm not the biggest pizza fan, but I ate two slices and enjoyed them.They leave the bottles of water with you on a coaster which is thoughtful.In summary; I'm sure that the cooked dishes are wonderful (as I have heard that they are). However, the buffet is nothing special with the usual spread (although for a vegetarian and light eater I found it perfect) and above-average quality that you would expect from a restaurant of this quality. The service is wonderful and for the most part, the other diners are considerate.

Central,Italian,"This was my first Restaurant Week experience so I was really looking forward to it. Unfortunately I did not have a good first impression. Somehow they have our booking details but did not have a available table for us when we arrived on time. Anyway the manager offered us to wait at the bar table. We made our orders and had some bread while waiting. Finally our table was available but it took them awhile to set it up. The bread basket had a few different bread types and came with olive oil and balsalmic vinegar. I requested for extra herb bread but it never arrived...The Restaurant Week menu offers a three course lunch with coffee/tea for $158+10%. For appetiser I had the sashimi salad which is supposed to be one of their signature dishes. I did like the citrus sauce which was tangy but there was not enough of it. The fish was fresh but there was not much taste.Appetiser0AppetiserFor main I had the baramundi fish which was ok. Again the sauces (two types) were more interesting than the fish itself.

It was not too sweet and went well with the coffee.

Central,Italian,"Went to Il Posto 97 for the first time to have lunch, as part of the restaurant week deal. The interior arrangement of the tables was nice, as it gave a spacious feel and a much needed respite from the HK lunchtime crowd. From the prix fixe menu, i selected the octopus, potato foam, potato and parsley for the starter; pan seared barramundi fillet, jerusalem artichoke, sour cream and sauteed vegetable for the main; and for dessert i was offered a lemon tart as the two choices on the menu consisted of some alcohol that were not so pregnancy-friendly.There was olive oil and balsamic vinegar on our table, but our bread basket took a long time to arrive, and we thought that perhaps we were not going to get it as we were already getting quite a good deal from the restaurant week prix fixe menu. It did arrive after what seemed like ages (more than 20 minutes), and the waiter expressed his apologies for the delay.The bread basket was a saviour and we noticed that the bread baskets on the other tables were all empty, so we deduced that the other diners had also waited a bit for their food and hence had finished the bread while waiting. Our starters arrived and the octopus, potato foam, potato and parsley was very good.Then we proceeded to wait for a rather long time for the main course to arrive. While waiting, we observed that the waiters were all very busy trying to bring out new dishes from the kitchen to serve to the diners, as well as trying to clear dishes from tables where the diners had finished their food. However, it was a bit disorganized as some papers stuck to the dishes that were freshly brought out from the kitchen started to fly away (presumably, the papers were marked to indicate which tables they were for), and as they were placed in a row on the counter, the waiters had to make a few extra trips to and fro each time to get missing items (such as cutlery, or sauce).Our mains were served 40 minutes past our arrival, and my pan seared barramundi fillet was excellent. However, on the plates of our main course, you could see that there had been a flurry of activity in the kitchen as the sauce that was splattered on the plates were not wiped and cleaned up before being served to us. Our guess was that the kitchen might have been missing one or two staff today, resulting in the haphazardness.Then we waited for our dessert and tea to be served. While waiting, we noticed the blackboard with the daily soup of the day written, as well as some other dishes that were on offer. It seemed that the words too, had been hurriedly written on the blackboard. Our desserts arrived and my lemon tart was just as i expected it to be, while my lunch companion felt a little let down by the tiramisu (in terms of shape and form, as well as the tiny portion).Menu0MenuOctopus, potato foam, potato and parsley - Starter0Octopus, potato foam, potato and parsley - StarterPan seared barramundi fillet, jerusalem artichoke, sour cream, sauteed vegetable - Main course...0Pan seared barramundi fillet, jerusalem artichoke, sour cream, sauteed vegetable - Main course...Lemon tart - Dessert0Lemon tart - Dessert",iL Posto 97,4.7,170,nan,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-il-posto-97/95921?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

The environment was comfy.Smoke duck salade0Smoke duck saladeI had Smoked duck and baby spinach salad for starter. The duck pieces were so tender, seasoning was just right.

The texture of squid was special, inside still tasted raw. Overall taste was good.House Cured Salumi, good for serving with wine. Mozzarella with Tomato, mozzarella was homemade and was so good! It's perfect match to be served with tomato. And the texture of mozzarella was just good! Couldn't think of other word to descride this dish. This is one of the favorite I had in this meal.Beet root, very health choice, my mum loves it!Potato Chips, I don't know it's official name.

I could even finish the whole can without any hesitation!Bolognaise with mozzarella cheese baguette, the tomato was fresh, the melted cheese was so good!

This dish was highly recommended by their staff.The egg was great.

Central,Italian,"Went to Lupa yesterday. Over the last year, I have actually been a fan of Lupa, defending its bad rep on blogs and among my friends and acquaintances who have bad-mouthed it. Yes, the fish and meat dishes were poorly prepared, but the salumi, cheeses, and pastas were tasty and diverse, with some well-thought out dishes.No more. I may never go back.My wife and I went for lunch yesterday only to find that you could no longer order a la carte on Sundays. You are stuck with a hideously expensive buffet, which is meager in its selections: a large table of various kinds of salad, most of which are pretty similar; a board covered with prosciutto and another board covered with salami were it for salumi; an almost empty board with a few stray pieces of parmiggiano for cheese; a pork carving station; tomato or white bean soup; a bowl of polenta. That's about it. The dessert buffet appeared untouched, likely because nothing there looked particularly worthwhile.The buffet did offer a selection of some dishes made in the kitchen, which offered only more disappointment. I ordered 'eggs purgatory', which was described as 'oven baked eggs, spicy salami and tomato'. What I got: six potato-halves surrounding a bit (less than one) egg in tomato sauce. No sign of spicy salami. The dish itself was mediocre.I felt the whole experience was geared towards separating the diner from their dollar.I was so put off, I think I may never go back.No wonder there's never a wait for tables anymore.",Lupa,nan,400,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-lupa/96194?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
Central,Italian,"Linguini Fini has always been one of the pasta places I wanted to try out. On a weekly lunch get together with a  friend, we decided to try it out. Located inside the L Place, it's a pretty big restaurant with lots of tables. We made a reservation anyways so we dont have to wait. We both decided to try out the three course set lunch($118) which comes with either a soup or salad or an appetizer (8 hr tripe),  then a choice of their signature pasta or grilled beef tongue, followed with a drink and a cookie for dessert. I chose the Roasted pepper & eggplant soup for appetitzer. The soup tasted like a tomato base soup with a hints of roasted pepper flavoring. I think the eggplant just give a little thickness to the soup but you can't really taste the eggplant. The soup was light and very refreshing to drink. Although I would prefer it a little bit more smooth, I think it's a good soup overall. 0Then for the entree, I chose the classic linguini fini. It's basically a fresh made tomato sauce tossed in pasta. I like how you can tell the sauce is freshly made because there are chunks of tomatoes in it and it has the tangy tomato flavor rather than your store bought tomato sauce aroma. The pasta is cooked al dente which is the chewier pasta. The pasta was good, but it wasn't amazing. I wish there are more components to add a little bit more depth to the dish rather than just simple tomato sauce with no surprises. I got bored eating it when I was half way through the dish. 0After we were done with the entree, we ordered iced tea to end our meal. But the service was so bad that we waved down 3 different people to check on our drink order and we still didn't get our drink after 20 minutes. Finally, a waiter checked the computer and realized our order was never placed! So the drink came out very quickly after the order was placed. Then, we had to ask the waiter to bring out our cookies quickly since we waited so long for the drinks already. But it took them another 10 minutes just to pull out some already made cookies to the table.  Good thing the cookies were pretty delicious peanut butter cookies so I was less angry at the situation. 0Supplementary InformationSet lunch is only &98 for tables out by 12:30pm",Linguini Fini,3.6,118,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-linguini-fini/52332?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

The texture of the spaghetti was fine- lightly tough and firm. There were satisfactory amount of calamaries which were chewy. I liked the garlicky sause.

The first thing we noticed upon our arrival was the fact that the staff looked much younger and less experienced than before. Perhaps the expansion to Shanghai has taken a chunk of experience away from the core here.Lunch was the usual 2-course or 3-course selection unless we want to go splurge with the a la carte menu. That had stayed pretty much the same since its debut.0 Confit of ""Taiyouren"" organic egg (Grade: 3/5)After a basket of bread, here came our appetizers first with a confit of ""Taiyouren"" organic egg. The onsen egg was met with a nice roman cauliflower emulsion and roasted herb bread to form a surprisingly rich combination of flavors.0 Octopus and lobster (Grade: 2.5/5)Another starter was a dish of sauted octopus and lobster. It had a bit of Mediterranean twist to it after the addition of an acquerello rice salad (which tasted very much like cous cous).I thought this was an average dish. The previous organic egg starter faired slightly better. 0After finishing up our appetizers, we sat back to relax while waiting for our main courses to arrive. But that seemed to be taking forever.More than half an hour has passed us by and we began to lose a bit of our patience.

I tasted it, and its sweetness was not that of a coke zero, so I asked the waiter if they had coke zero by the can or bottle instead and he said no. Then I asked for the drink list and found out that there were no coke listed, but only pepsi, so I asked the waiter again they had coke zero in the list, ad of course he said no, only pepsi.

We were hoping the person who was sent to catch the crabs weren't drowned.   Our linguine arrived at 13:50, no-matter, we still had 10 minutes to finish and run back to our office.  We paid the bill even before we started eating, since we were really runing out of time. The linguine was really good, the crab meat was chewy and tasted fresh, I was not sure what the sauce was but it tasted a bit like diluted lobster bisque.  Linguine was cooked nicely as well, it was just right.  Herbs on the linguine certainly adds flavour to the dish.  The flavour wasn't too strong to cover the freshness of the crab meat - well balanced. really nice0really niceThe waitress cheerfully checked back, deemsum was furious and refused to answer, not even a single word (black face) .

Central,Italian,"I had some pretty good experience dinning at restaurants with Michelin Stars or operated by chefs awarded wtih Michelin Star. I guess I was spoiled. Food connoisseurs, please lower your expectations if you really want to try this restaurant.My wife and I sat down at the table and the waitress came over and introduced the set menus for the day. There was no hard copy of the menu, according to the waitress, they were too busy preparing the official opening on the following Monday. I would say that's an unprofessional excuse for laziness. Anyway, here is the menu:Tasting Menu - beef tartare for appertiser and red snapper for main dish. Sounds like a $138 daily set menu at Soho!Set Menu - squid salad or soup as first course, sea bass risotto; linguini with tomato in 4 styles (sounds interesting); or veal as the main course.I had a glimpse of their other Tasting Menu on the 'Menu"" and thought of ordering the 4 course menu priced at $880, but somehow I told myself I shouldn't take the risk. It was the right decision with hindsight. So we ordered the set lunches. While we were waiting, bread was served, but no sign of olive oil nor balsamic vinegar. Even after we asked for them, we had to wait for more than 5 minutes for the olive oil and vinegar!?! There were just about 5 tables of diners and at least the same number of servers around if not more. I wonder why? The microwave oven reheated bread was very hot outside and very dry inside. How do you like that?We had the squid salad, presentation was OK, colourfully garnished with the different types of vegetables. The taste is acceptable but it's kind of interesting for the squid they used. All tentacles! Where was the body? I guess they saved them up for the more expensive dishes, not for set menu!My wife had the fish risotto. It wasn't bad at all. The lemon zest added to the risotto gave it a nice refreshing taste. Unfortunately, the veal I had wasn't too desirable. The chunk of meat sat on a bed of greenish-brown paste and the whole dish was merely warm. I must say I prefer the $40 beef brisket noodle. At least the meat is tender and the soup is hot. Yes, it was really that bad!They served only one type of dessert, house made gelato. The waiter pushed out a trolley with a mountain of gelato enough to serve 10 people, but he scooped two tiny servings of gelato into two glass containers and added two tiny spoons of strawberry compote on top. Then push the rest of the gelato and compote back to the kitchen. The ""show"" may impress a 10-year old kid, but definitely not me. Qulaity of the dessert? Nothing to write about!My wife and I didn't add sugar to after-meal tea/coffee. Only after I finished my coffee then I realized they didn't bother to offer us sugar at all. Nice service!Thorughout the entire meal, nobody came by to ask for our comments of their service or food quality. Something that you would expect from the waiter, head waiter or manager for a newly opened restaurant. I notice that the waiters were only attentive to the guests of one table. Obviously the lady guest seemed to know one of the staff there. I overheard them discussking about having a birthday party at their restaurant. No wonder! That's why they were served petit four, but not for our table.In return for their discriminative service, I didn't tip them at all. First time in my life at a ""proper"" restaurant.While lunch is always charged at a lower price than dinner but I belive if a restaurant cares about the quality of food they serve, the dishes should be prepared equally well. For restaurants that can't meet this simple standard, they don't deserve my repect or money.

Even though it was a dine in option, the pasta still came in take away boxes and disposable wear. We wouldn't expect more from what seems to be a fast food joint but the food was something to be remembered. The pesto sauce was about 75% made of parmesan and apart from a few greenish herbs, the remainder was oil (about 1 inch deep). The arrabiata sauce was even more peculiar.

The spagetti was very dry, plates looked nice but the flavor wasn't always that great. Cream soup not warm enough, very watery. If you wish to have a nice quiet talk, this is not the place for you. It doesn't worth the price at all!Supplementary InformationI am very mad about this restuarant today! 1. The resturant was very hot and the waiter claimed that the air condition was already on high. They had only one small fan on nearby the entrance, and 2 small fans facing the kitchen. So, the people sitting in the middle pretty much had to suffer the heat spreading from the kitchen. 2.  We ordered 9 set lunches, which included soup, main dish and drink. Our soup came seperately which is fine. However, it was not hot at all! I can't even say it's warm. Imagine cream soup like room temperature milk texture. How terrrible it is!3. After soup, we waited quite a while for our main dishes. The last 2 main dishes didn't even come until we reminded the waiter twice and the rest of us almost finished. 4. The WORST of all is, the waiter poured 2 iced lemon tea all over my back and also on one of my colleagues' pants when he served our drinks . My half-eated lunch was all over with iced lemon tea and of course, my whole back, my pants were all soaked! The owner said that they will waive 2 lunch set price for us as apology. However, when we paid, they only give us a 10% discount instead of what they promised. The owner even said that he already did a big favor for us as my lunch is less than 10% of what we supposed to pay! Not a sincere apology at all! It is your waiter's fault ,not mine!

The menu can be seen at http://www.te.hk/TeMenu.pdf but note that there may be variations within between branches. And hmm, this is not the most update. Coz it doesn't show the one I had today heh. It was raining cats and dogs. The restaurant was only half full. I guess people preferred staying in and ordering delivery.

However, I still find it convienient compared to other places in soho.Decoration: This place is beautifully decorated with comfortable sofas. Although the chairs are also quite comfortable themselves, there is little space between the chair and the table, which can cause some discomfort if you have longer legs.Menu: Appetizer buffet costs around 108 and with a main course it would range from 128-148. Main courses (to the best of my memory) include salad, penne, carbonara, risotto, fish, rib eye steak, beef hamburger. Appetizer Buffet: There's not a lot of choice but the quality of the food was generally good. Especially the shrimps and salmon. The shrimps were quite big and tasted very fresh. The vegetables suited a health junkie like me with loads of tomatos and lettice. I liked the salad pasta because of its pesto sauce and it was made al dente. However, my mum thought that it was a bit too hard for her liking. There was also parma ham and different selected cuts. The best thing about the minstrone soup was that it kept me warm after eating so many cold dishes. Main Course: I ordered the grilled rib eye steak (medium) whilst my mum had the grilled fish. We both thought that the grilled rib eye was better than the fish (although the fish itself was okay). I guess for 150 the griled rib eye was already value for money and it was nicely done (I hate over-cooked steak). The portion wasnt big but thats understandable since its supposed to be a semi-buffet. Dessert: There were different kinds of fruits to choose from and the watermelon was very sweet! They only had around 4 types of desserts but it was enough for me already since I was already very full. The cream brulee was probably the worst dish in the lunch menu  but the chocolate cake had a great chocolate mousse layer on top!

It is not clearly marked on the website or at all, so I was already disappointed when I found out there was no buffet on the weekends. So I had to choose something from the a la carte menu. We were given two pieces of slightly stale bread when we sat down, but we had to ask for butter or olive oil to go with it. We ordered the Quattro Formaggio pizza, Linguine with clams and the baked red snapper. Pizza was really good with a nice thick fluffy crust and crispy base. The tomato sauce wasn't too overpowering and the cheeses were delicious. Top marks for the pizza! The snapper was quite good with a nice gingery flavour, but the spinach was slightly on the bitter side. 0The linguine however was a BIG let down. This is my favourite type of pasta and I've tasted vongole (clams) all over Italy and in lots of restaurants - it is always my first choice when it comes to pasta. The waiter warned me that is quite a salty dish, but I always prefer it that way. But this dish - even for me, was actually really salty and not in a pleasant way. And worst of all, there was still some sand in some of the clams which made it really awful to eat, made the dish gritty and difficult to get out of my mouth. I pointed it out to our waitress who didn't even apologise and made up some lame excuse which didn't make any sense to me. We weren't even offered a dessert menu so didn't get to try any. Our bill came to $780 including the 10% service charge. We usually round up but really didn't feel the meal or the service deserved any extra tip.

Central,Italian,"Atmosphere:First impression is really nice with elegant decoration and an awesome Terrace - Closed during lunch time unfortunately. Open kitchen on your right hand side when you arrive in the restaurant - A bit hidden though.Tables are a too packed though and gets noisy really quickly.Service:Warm welcoming staff on arrival - Service is the usual HK stuff unfortunately : An army of weak service staff.Somelier:From New York, took time to explain a bit about the wine nose, flavors, specificities which is great since we ordered a cheap Rose wine. Wine was ok and reasonably priced (according to hk standards): 300 hkd.Food:> Appertizer - Combination of seafoods starters: Out of 3, 1 was outstanding (Preserved Tuna and Cannellini) 1 is ok (Baccala with Olives and Citrus), 1 was really average (Octopus and Celery)> Pasta - Carbonara: Ok, the Pork Jowl is tasty but I would expect a more creamy sauce.> Pasta - Ricotta Gnocchi with Fennel and Sweet Sausage: Good, but only 10 pieces.> Pasta - Bucatini alAmatriciana: Good, but again the portion is extremely minimalist.Plates temperature:Starters: Were fresh and cold enough - good pointMains: Were definitely not warm enough, I almost rejected the carbo pastasDamage:700 hkd per headConclusion:Overall experience is Ok Minus, Overpriced comparred to what you can get elsewhere.

Central,Italian,"For the restaurant week, I and my colleague had lunch at 12:15pm, when we got there, only 2-3 tables were occupied. The waitress gave us a restaurant week menu (HKD238) and a normal lunch menu (HKD98 for 2 courses), I compared the starters and the main courses, the starters are exactly the same, only the main that they have an item in difference, the restaurant week's one included a dessert which I can order the same on a normal menu for extra HKD40. , so the difference is only tea & coffee not included in the normal one. 0At the end, we chose the normal menu which saved us HKD100 each even we added a dessert. We had some bread and when we asked for olive oil and vinegar, it did took a while for the waitress to get.The starter was very fresh(with mango....)Pan roasted chicken leg with corns n rockets - the chicken was actually quite juicy, the corn at the bottom was nicely cooked .Tiramisu was pretty good, not too much alcohol favour which I personally not like.0The lunch set is worth for try and we should be coming back sometimes.",Cecconi's Italian,3.3,150,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-cecconis-italian/18311?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
Central,Italian,"I have been to Linguini Fini for dinner twice and quite like the place. I had been thinking about bringing my family over, but was held back because they didn't accept reservation before. Now that they do, I had to bring them there.Linguini Fini extended to the ground floor where Cantopop was before, possibly due to the high demand at rush hour. The manager said they are still seeking a location for Cantopop. The reception also moved to the ground floor, so approach the receptionist on the ground floor for your table instead! (So you won't end up like me bringing my whole family into the lift and came back out since we did not have access to the floor. *blush)0Once the escalator doors opened, you will see a nice bar area with a long wooden table and red long coach. Further inside are lots of squared tables and sofa booths with comfortable spacing. There are also a semi-opened kitchen area where several dishes are placed. If you look around the dinning area, you will see lots of graphics painted on the walls, which are masterpieces by local artist Start From Zero. If you pay more attention while walking around in HK and Macau, you will probably see a lot of theirs designs too. I also like the banker lamp on the sofa booth area, which makes things more classy. There were also casual music playing at the background to accompany your food. All in all, the ambiance was pretty nice.0Service was as usual nice and friendly. The server brought us a menu of the day on a wooden chalk board, and we ordered cold cuts as my dad loves it alot. My server, an Asian who couldn't speak chinese, made my parents wonder if non-english speakers are welcomed to the restaurant. I would think its a good opportunity for him to at least try learning since he is working in Asia anyways?0LF Salumi PlatterLonza (Left) - Cured loin that was mildy salty and sweet. Quite nice!bresaola (Right) - Glossy cured beef that was rubbery textured and not quite salty, most boring among the four.Finocchiona (Far Back) - Cured loin that was spicy, salty and fatty but yum. The texture was rubbery if cmoared to Picante.Picante (Front) - Glossy cured loin that has the same spiciness as Finocchiona but also less salty and fatty.0Picante Pizza $128 (7/10)The pizza was quite delicious. The crust was crispy at the rim but soft in the middle. The tomato taste was very strong and sweet, and paired well with the lightly tasted mozarella buffalo. The Picante was too little to give enough taste to the pizza though. Anyhow, I was quite nice.0Dried Shrimp Diavola Linguine $88 (10/10)Love this linguine to the max, its simply splendid. Of course the linguine was cooked al dente, but the most excellent part was the savoury tomato sauce. Imagine every mouth full was filled with a strong shrimp and tomato taste with mild spiciness and al dente linguine. How great was that!0LF Benedicts $98 (5/10)The dish was crazily orangy, I have never seen hollandaise sauce that organy before. The poached egg was nicely made with semi-solid whites and running orangy yolk. The egg tasted really lovely with sweet and creamy yolk, i wonder where they source them from.  The 'Nduja replaced the traditional bacon but was not salty enough in my own opinion. The Hollandaise sauce tasted nice with slight spiciness, but was a bit too much. Not only had it overpowered the natural taste of the egg and 'Nduja, it also soften the muffin too. I was a bit disappointed.00FINAL COMMENTS...Lunching at Linguini Fini is a totally different dinning experience from dinning at night. It is more relaxing during the day, but more energetic at dinner hour which loud music is played. I think it would be better to bring family at lunch and friends at dinner hour, since most parents hate place that are loud and noisy?FOOD RECOMMENDED- LF Salumi Platter- Picante Pizza- Dried Shrimp Diavola Linguini                Supplementary Information- Make reservation in advance is recommended.",Linguini Fini,3.6,100,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-linguini-fini/52332?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw
Central,Italian,"Anyone who has lived in the States, especially with in NYC, would not be unfamiliar with Mario Batali.  He is not just a famous chef and restaurateur but also has numberous cookbooks and TV shows as well as products and a gigantic Italian gourmet market (Eataly).  The Batalis empire is so huge that I am always amazed by his energy and ability to manage them all.Although I havent been to his restaurants overseas, I frequented his restaurants, particularly those in Manhattan when I lived there.  Different Batalis restaurants present different styles and types of Italian food   Del Posto being a rare Italian haute cuisine establishment, Esca being seafood-centric, Otto and Lupa being causal Italian treats, simple, hearty, and easy to approach and share .  My mom's favorite is Del Posto, and I love his first restaurant Babbo the most.  I used to visit Lupa or Otta regularly with my colleagues and friends, as the food was consistent, fresh and seasonally driven, and very reasonably priced.Normally I dont rush to try new restaurants, as I want to wait till the restaurants work out all the kinks and smoothly operate before I dine there.  However, I have been craving for simple good Italian for too long, and  I was eager to try Lupa out.  So on the first day of its lunch service, I visited with 2 friends, and revisited in 2 days.  These were my experiences in the 2 LUNCH visits.For the first day of Lupas lunch service, an impromptu causal lunch of 3 of us turned into full lunch menu tasting!  We couldnt resist but to order up almost everyone on the lunch menu.  Currently you must order the buffet of antipasti and desserts, and add soup, primi/pizza , and/or secondi of your choice. These items are mostly available at dinner as well, but priced much higher as a la carte dishes.  There were around 12-13 types of vegetables and pesca antipasti and salad, 4 types of salumi,  rosemary and sea salt focaccia, grissini, 5 types of desserts and fruits.  (Numbers might vary)  It is actually quite a bargain considered the selections and the generious portion sizes.I am not a big eater particularly at lunch, so I tried only a few that sounded interesting.Antipasti buffet:My picks of antipasti: lingua, fregula, & caponata0My picks of antipasti: lingua, fregula, & caponataRound 1: various salumi and seafood. I like the lingua (thin sliced ox tongue) with fennel and citrus peels and razor clams with fregula and basil the most. I dont see much fregula featured in Italian restaurants in Hong Kong so even there werent much razor clams I wanted more of this. For round 2, I had mainly vegetables and I enjoyed the caponata, grilled peppers with anchovies, and cipolla onions and balsamic. I also encored more lingua and razor clams and thats it for my buffet.Moving to primi and pizza. Despite just the 3 of us we ordered all 3 pasta available and a pizza . Pizza Margherita, the simplest and most classic pizza was our choice, just to test the water.  Pizza Margherita: Still need improvement0Pizza Margherita: Still need improvementThe Margherita pizza had nice char and bubbles at the cornicione and a chewy and fairly crusty base. However, the center was a bit too soggy for my liking. The wetness was probably due to the fresh tomato sauce which was a bit too watery and bland. The sauce and cheese required more seasoning.  We talked to Chef Allen, the chief chef at Lupa, and he mentioned that they were still getting used to the new oven and adjusting their execution and recipes every day.  I think it had potential and its the main reason I paid a second visit so quickly after this lunch.The 3 pastas available at lunch were also simple classic Italian pasta dishes, some of which being signatures in Lupa New York.  Bavette Cacio e Pepe is a thin spaghetti-like pasta made with black pepper and Cacio di Roma cheese.  This one was well executed with a robust peppery taste and al dente pasta.  Very simple but nice!  Bavette Cacio e Pepe 0Bavette Cacio e Pepe .Spaghetti alla Carbonara also had a good eggy flavor, with enough seared guanciale that were crispy and fatty.  They followed the authentic recipe without the use of cream.  The only caveat was that the egg yolk curdled a little when it cooled down. Overall a very good carbonara!Spaghetti alla Carbonara0Spaghetti alla Carbonara.Ricotta Gnocchi with Sausage and Fennel was definitely fluffier and less dense than what I had tried in other Italian restaurants in Hong Kong.  However I couldn't taste much fennel or sasuage that went with the cheesy tomato sauce .  Good gnocchi but I preferred a sauce with more complexity. (and if they can also give the gnocchi a crispy exterior by pan-searing it, like they do at Babbo and Del Posto)Ricotta Gnocchi with Sausage and Fennel 0Ricotta Gnocchi with Sausage and Fennel .We were greedy  and ordered 2 mains.  Braised Pork Shoulder with Averna and CucumberBraised Pork Shoulder w Averna & Cucumber0Braised Pork Shoulder w Averna & Cucumber. The main course pork shoulder used Italian Averna (an Italian liquer) and ginger which gave it an Asian flavor resembling Chinese black vinegar. Unfortunately the pork shoulder meat was too lean and the exterior meat was stringy, possibly caused by deep-frying.  Chef said he is trying to source pork knees which are fattier and more juicey locally to substitute as it was his original attempted recipe with pork kneesThe Averna used for the braised pork shoulder. Thanks Chef Allen for a taste of it! (I didn't get drunk even though it was of 32% alcohol )Averna for the sauce - very nice~0Averna for the sauce - very nice~.Lamb Braciole with olives and cannellini beans Lamb Braciole with olives and cannellini beans0Lamb Braciole with olives and cannellini beansThe lamb braciole was quite fatty this time with gelatinous and tender meat, rolled with cheese and crispy breadcrumbs. The olive flavor was very prominent, so good for those who like olives.   The crispy and crunchy textural contrast of the breadcrumbs outside and the pine nuts inside was simply fantastic.  The cannellini beans were also tender.   Although the lamb was definitely over salted during this visit,  this issue was fixed in the second visit.We were too full to enjoy the dessert buffet so I just had one bite of a few, including cinnamon amaretti cookies, chocolate bread pudding, Bombolini with cream filling.Dessert buffet - too full to try...0Dessert buffet - too full to try....On our 2nd visit, there was no lingua at the buffet so simply cheese including gorgonzola dolce, 2 types of pecorino, ricotta salata. More razor clams with fregula and basil and caponata for me.No Lingua this time, but more cheese0No Lingua this time, but more cheese.I ordered a fresh lemon soda as I couldnt drink at lunch and it was very refreshing.  The olive oil they use here is Lorenza No.1, (I was hoping they use DaVero which they use in Babbo in NYC). Fresh Lemon Soda, Lorenza No.1 Olive Oil0Fresh Lemon Soda, Lorenza No.1 Olive Oil.My biggest prize was the pizza. MY (note: mine, don't know about others') Funghi Taleggio pizza was very delicious! Pizza Funghi Taleggio1Pizza Funghi TaleggioPie crust was chewy without being too hard and the cornicione had crusty bubbles. For the upskirt I like it to be crustier and with more char, but this was pretty good.  The cornicione with puffed bubbles was still chewy but crustier than last time. When it cooled down it was much chewier...A plethora of aromatic shrooms, crunchy and juicy!  They went wonderfully with taleggio, one of my favorite melting cheese.  Much better than the Margherita last time! It could still do with a little more crusty texture.  Its not exactly Napoletana-styled pizza I say, more like Batalis own style, but quite close.  Please keep improving!My friend ordered the Lamb Braciole with Olives and Cannellini Beans which I had last time.  Not overly salted this time, but the lamb was leaner than before. I like the previous fattier lamb more.Not big on the desserts so just amaretti cookies and peanut butter cookies. More taleggio (because I real like it ) and rosemary focaccia and moscato to end the meal.Overall I was happy with my two lunch visits, especially given the reasonable price.  It is not up to the standard of Lupa New York yet, and not everything is perfect.  More consistency in execution of the main dishes and pizza would improve the overall performance immensely.  Chef Allen also told us that the team is trying to get better and more diverse sourcing of ingredients for a more enchanting menu. I am going to dinner in a few days to try out more dishes exclusive to the dinner menu. I believe giving it some time, Lupa will be an excellent causal Italian restaurant and a great addition to Hong Kongs Italian culinary scene.Supplementary InformationCurrently if you sit in the main dining room of Lupa,  the buffet of antipasti and desserts must be ordered at lunch - $168, you can: - add soup for an extra $30- add primi/pizza  for an extra $50- and/or secondi for an extra $90 Dinner is mainly a la carte dishes.

Central,Italian,"The boss wanted to treat the team to lunch and eventually settled on this restaurant as the venue. I had been here for dinner previously and was quite impressed by the quality of the food. The lunch sets did not disappoint either. As there were more than 20 in our party, we were requested by the restaurant to pre-order to ensure sufficient time for preparation. The service was polite and food was served up in a timely manner.  The 3-course lunch sets were very affordable, ranging from $88 to $108.Set lunch menu0Set lunch menu Appetizers were a choice of a soup and a variety of salads. The Caesar salad had fresh greens and crunchy croutons, though a little more bacon and cheese would have been preferred.There were quite a few main courses to select from, ranging from pasta, rice, fish, chicken, and various types of red meat.  I ordered the baby lamb fillet without realizing that it came with a mint gravy, which I do not normally enjoy. I was a little concerned after I caught a whiff of the mint when the dish was set before me. But was I in for a surprise! The mint in the gravy was very light. The gravy was a good balance of sweet and sour and a perfect complement to the tender lamb strips. I would definitely go back for it. Baby lamb fillet0Baby lamb fillet I had a taste of the seafood paella that my colleague ordered and it was quite nice too. The rice was cooked just right and the portion of seafood was generous. The feedback on the grilled ribeye steak was also favorable.The set lunch included a choice of beverages or dessert of the day. I was hoping that tiramisu would be offered as I recall it to be quite good when I had it on my previous visit. But the dessert turned out to be a chocolate cake served warm and a la mode - it did not disappoint though. The cake was of a dense texture and rich, but not overly sweet. Very nice with the vanilla ice cream.

Central,Italian,"After not working in Central for so long, a trip to Bettys Kitschen reminded me of how expensive Central could be for mediocrity. The restaurant was pleasant enough: huge windows that made the best of daylight and harbour view, tables were nicely spaced out... but oh, what's that on the table cloth  Jam from breakfast...  So I moved to the next table, hmm, this one has orange stuff on it... onto the third table.  Come on, this is a fairly fancy restaurant charging fairly fancy prices, please make some effort beyond the decor.  After sitting down for at least 10 minutes, still no one came to offer at least some water, most unusual service.As I said, I was a little unaccustomed to prices in Central nowadays but $238 for a full breakfast (without drinks),  $288 for a meat pie  The set lunch at $258 for 2 courses (w/o tea or coffee) suddenly looked remarkably good value for money by comparison.  All 3 of us opted for the set lunch with beetroot salad with goat cheese as starter and paella as main course.Beet salad - Paella - Panna Cotta0Beet salad - Paella - Panna CottaThe beetroot salad was decent.  Nice chunks of beetroot (both red and yellow) and two pieces of good-size goat brie on toast with drizzle of honey.  It would have been much better if they were less stingy with the frise and the honey; the former was scant and the latter was literally just a hint.  As for the toast, could they at least remove the crust from the sides  That would improve the presentation immensely...As expected, the paella was a tiny portion but looked good.  After the salad, I knew not to expect a lot of seafood in my paella.  There were 1 mussel, 3 small clams, one of which full of sand, and a few pieces of baby octopus.  It tasted fine but nothing to shout about.Though still hungry, I really could not bring myself to ordering dessert.  My cousin ordered the panna cotta with berries.  As you can see from the picture, it was fresh from the fridge!  I know, I know, obviously the panna cotta would be from the fridge, but seeing it with condensation dripping just killed appetite.  The one redeeming feature of the lunch was the espresso, rich and hot, and at $18 a shot, it was the only thing worth its price.There is a big group of captive audience in IFC but still, they are not without alternatives.

Central,Italian,"I ordered the chicken, tomato, rosemary pasta with wholemeal pasta and it was not a pleasant experience.  The pasta was the roughest wholemeal pasta I've had.  I know wholemeal pasta is not as smooth as normal pasta, but this one was dotted with visible bits of fibre with a rough mouth-feel.  The sauce had bits of plant fibre in it which had to be picked out as they were not edible (not sure what it was, it looked like the stalk of something).  There was very little chicken, diced into tiny cubes. A big chunk of pasta was stuck together and, as a result, raw.  I stuck a fork in it and could lift up the bottom layer of the box. That was my first and only time.  I might consider giving them a second chance to see if it's a one off bad experience, but I would definitely not order the chicken, or the wholemeal pasta",Pasta Mio,1.6,68,8,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-pasta-mio/50998?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
Central,Italian,"I struggled about reviewing this restaurant as there are already many recent reviews and I didn't take any photos. However, I do have some thoughts about the place and since it was only yesterday when we went, my short memory can recall it.I was quite intrigued about this restaurant. The name, type of cuisine, whether it was casual or chic, expensive or not, maybe because it is unlike any of Alan Yau's restaurants that he opened in London. Since we wanted to celebrate a friend's birthday early ( her birthday on NY's eve, so inconvenient), it was between here and TWB and there is no booking at TWB.So, the menu looked varied and I liked that they serve breakfast/brunch also as I like those smaller meals most. As I was lazy and love foie gras, I went for the 2 course Christmas lunch which had a foie gras terrine starter and fish fillet served with chestnut puree. Birthday girl went for the All Day Breakfast and our other friend also had the 2 course Christmas lunch but she went for main course and dessert. Her choices were roast Capon with Brussels sprouts and stuffing and the chocolate and chestnut chocolate log.As I always judge a restaurant by their bread and coffee, the fresh and crispy baguette scored high. Strange thing was that there were 2 for the 3 of us. They were quite hard to break apart, so could be a bit awkward if people don't know each other well. But hey, that didn't stop me. My foie gras terrine was a big chunk with a tiny balsamic vinegar salad and a piece of toasted brioche. After the Christmas binging, it was a bit much. Luckily, my friend helped with a little and I happily ate the rest with the baguette. The fish main course was comparatively small but the fish had a good firm texture and flavour. My friend's Capon was done really well and even the breast was tender instead of squeaky or dry. Birthday girl's All Day Breakfast looked great, it even had fried Black Pudding, a real British treat if you like fried animal blood. My friend didn't and I wanted to take it home to my daughter but we forgot. My daughter is a Black pudding fan but we can't find it anywhere in HK.  All 3 of us are lovers of All Day Breakfast and are always on the look out for a good one. Here, we found one. Maybe it was Christmas overeating again but birthday girl said she didn't like any of the desserts on the menu. The Christmas log was beautifully presented as it was a small log all by itself instead of a slice of a big log. However, it was too sweet for any of us. I had read that the coffee at this restaurant was served in glass pots with no lids. Luckily this had changed to normal cups and the coffee was good. So all my boxes are ticked.And I get it, I know what it's about. Good fresh, unpretentious food and atmosphere. Not cheap but a nice experience. Will want to come back for brunch or tea some day.",Bettys Kitschen,nan,350,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-bettys-kitschen/51072?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

Central,Italian,"Back when I was a kid, my knowledge of pasta was limited to spaghetti, alphabets and Campbell soup   But it was a treat at the time.Then in the dormitory days, started to come across cheese macaroni, spaghettini, fettucine, canneloni and my favourite lasagna As the italian cuisine started to take a foothold in the local gourmet industry in recent years, more and more varieties of pasta were introduced into HK.First came ravioli, angel hair, fussili, inguini, penne followed by lots of other varieties -- short pastas like gnocchi and orecchiette; long pastas like farfelle and pappardelle; and stuffed pastas like tortellini ....However, a lot of these pastas were available mainly in specialty italian groceries or in higher end italian restaurants. And to be honest, I have only heard of the names of many, like gnocchi, orecchiette and tortellini, but hadvenever tried them.That was the scene until Pasta Mio came into the picture.Tucked under the mid-levels escalator at Cochrane St, Pasta Mio operates much like a fast food store specializing in pastas.  Fast, made-to-order and ready-to-go were the main features of the shop.  It also has a few seats, probably less than 10, outside the store but with a shade to protect customers from the sun.  Outdoor seats under the shade0Outdoor seats under the shadeThe place offers 10 different types of pastas and 10 different sauces.  The sauce was really different combinations of tomato, cream, cheese, mushrooms, herbs and cold cuts.  But the choice of pasta and sauce add up to a great combination of meals, perhaps only limited by one's imagination.  The combination of pastas and sauce0The combination of pastas and sauceYou select the pasta first, then the sauce, then the texture/consistency especially if you prefer tender rather than al dente pasta, followed by the size and any add-ons (extra cheese etc).The food is ready in 10 minutes after order.Pasta made to order on the spot0Pasta made to order on the spotDifferent pastas ready to-go0Different pastas ready to-goWe ordered:Tortellini in Pomodoro sauce (tomato & basil) 0Tortellini in Pomodoro sauce (tomato & basil)  This is my first bite of tortellini.  The tortellini has a spinach and cheese filling and a lot smaller than raviolis.  The sauce was light and refreshing, topped by a layer of parmesan cheese.  The serving was really generous.  Ours is a regular size order and it must have over 10 tortellinis.Fusilli in Boscaiola  0Fusilli in Boscaiola  The sauce is made of tomato, cream, ham and mushrooms.  The fusilli was al dente and the serving was generous.  However, the sauce was bit short and could barely coat the fusilli.  Again, the pasta was topped with a layer of parmesan that made the whole meal a lot tastier.Gnocchi in Amatriciana0Gnocchi in AmatricianaThe sauce is tomato and bacon.  Again the sauce was short.  This is my first time trying gnocchi.  Honestly, I found it a bit too chewy.  Heard that the pasta was made from a mix of flour and potato.  So it was very filling to the stomach but personally, I'd prefer the more traditional al dente pasta.Thanks to Groupon, the meal was only $33 a piece (regular price $66).  The presentation of the food was not quite appealing, and tastewise, was just above average.  However, at $33, it was a good deal for a quick italian meal.  For the ladies, they also serve fit-size pastas at a lower price.  In fact, at $29 you can have a fit-size pasta of the day which I think is a super deal.  $29 fit-size pasta of the day0$29 fit-size pasta of the dayBravo, Pasta mama mia, italiano.

Central,Italian,"Just off the escalator, tucked away along Elgin Street, is this total gem of a restaurant.While many others restaurants along the street have come and gone in the many years I have been in Hong Kong, Sole Mio has not only remained steadfast, but has also continued to serve consistently high quality food. Staff are friendly and attentive and feel like a part of the family now.For a work treat once every couple of months, I bring my team here for a very reasonably priced set lunch.  The set menu is usually limited to a choice between two appetizers and a main which also includes any of the pizzas on the menu.  If we decide to splash out and pick from the main menu, Spaghetti Di Mare (spaghetti with seafood) served with white wine sauce is a particular favourite of my team, as is my personal favourite Penne (or if you prefer, swap this for spaghetti) Voldastana  served with speck ham & asparagus in pink sauce (sauce Marie). If pizzas are more your thing then there is a whole range cooked fresh on the premises, a particular treat being the Capricciossa made with tomato sauce, mozzarella, homemade sausage, bell pepper and spicy salami. I've also taken visitors from the UK and Australia here for dinner. The menu is largely the same but it's a good excuse to try out some of the secondis such as involtini (pan-fried beef rolls stuffed with smoked ham, mushrooms & cheese) or ossobucco (braised veal shank) and sample their great selection of wines.One bit of advice: if you are going for lunch, book ahead.

Central,Italian,"I got the coupon from groupon.com at a price of $6x per set lunch.  I suppose the coupons would serve the purpose as if customers are having a ""tasting"" session with less portion. I know the restaurant has another shop on Granham Street and did try that before. The pasta there was quite good. Therefore, I rest assure that the new restaurant should have more or less the standard of the dishes they serve.My friend and I have ordered salad and soup of the day as the starter, sirloin steak as the main course, coffee for him and dessert for me.To me, I always value the bread that comes first. The bread, tasting like sponge cake, baked with onion and rosemary. Very tasty. We have therefore asked for another round...The soup of the day was pumpkin soup, which was my favourite. It seemed that the chef had added in some potatoes so as to make it more creamy with more texture. That's really nice.My friend had also enjoyed the tuna salad. The portion was big, as a starter. As for the steak, a bit disappointed, as there was no taste of beef, and it was not tender enough. Yet, I did appreciate the presentation of the dish when it was served, with plenty of side dishes like vegetables in different colours and mashed potatoes.The coffee tasted bold and full. The dessert, which was tiramisu that day, also as traditional as it should be.The female waiter there was very nice with passion. According to the ""rules"" of the coupon, we could only order either tea/coffee or dessert. But the lady treated us one more dessert, which made us surprised.

Central,Italian,"My partner and I went here for lunch, attracted by the reasonable HKD 88 three course set lunch, far cheaper than many other restaurants in the area. Service was welcoming, attentive, friendly and generally superb, no doubt helped by how quiet it was, perhaps because the restaurant's relatively new and slightly tucked away up Arbuthnot Road, despite being close to the ever lively Wyndham Road.The set menu had a reasonable choice of 5 or 6 starters, about 7 or 8 mains and included dessert of the day plus tea/coffee or a soft drink. I had a caesar salad and grilled sirloin steak, whilst my partner went for the greek salad starter and grilled chicken with mozzarella and bacon. The salads weren't large, just about right but tasted superb with excellent ingredients. The feta cheese which came with the greek salad was particularly soft and fresh - however the caesar salad was also extremely tasty.Main Course - Grilled Chicken0Main Course - Grilled ChickenThe mains were superb and beautifully presented - the steak much larger than one would have expected in a set menu such as this, and I actually had trouble finishing it. I tasted some of the chicken as well and was also suitably impressed. Served alongside each were sweet potato, carrots, pepper, broccoli, chive mash potato and aubergine - the steak came with a pepper sauce served separately, and the chicken a mushroom sauce, both of which complemented the meats perfectly.Dessert, although one was unable to choose, was an extremely soft chocolate brownie cake served with rasberry coulis and vanilla ice cream, not a huge helping but perfectly adequate given the generous main course, and more importantly extremely rich and flavourful.Drinkswise we each had Ginger Ale with the mains, which was fresh and spicy, and my only gripe would be with my post-meal latte, which surprisingly, given it's an Italian restaurant, was overly milky and lacking in taste. No such issues with the Italian ground coffee my partner ordered however.Overall it was a wonderful lunching experience however, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for Western Cuisine in the Central/Soho area. We'll definitely return again - I haven't been to the original Cenacolo closeby in Graham St but am surprised Cenacolo II is not a lot busier, given the all-round quality of food, presentation, service, and ambience, quite something at the price offered !",Cenacolo II,nan,143,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-cenacolo-ii/56049?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

Nothing special to be honest but it tasted fine. At least it wasn't dry as is often found in Italian restaurants. I had meatballs and the wife had a simple tomato sauce. Fine but not outstanding.Beer tasted fresh through the pipes and the coffee was hot, fresh and strong.Whilst the pasta wasn't amazing, the added salad and meats made up for it and we both came away filling contentedly full - still am actually.Worth a visit.",Barolo,4.5,150,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-barolo/42510?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

For the price of HK$98 (including bread, a salad, a pasta and drink, but no service charge), the lunch set seems to be a bargain.The texture of linguini fini was quite interesting. Yet, it tasted very salty (a common comment by all the friends). My friend who ordered another pasta dish said it was burnt and tasted average.Service-wise, they missed out our orders. We waited for over 20 mins to have our pasta served after we finished the salad. That's a luxury for lunch! Overall, i see a big room for improvement for the lunch here.

Central,Italian,"Overall not an impressive experience but the staff's great service attitude is worth mentioning!Waiting... and Waiting...  1) I don't come to Central for lunch often so while being here, I do want to try something new and different! Since I was craving for pasta, I've decided to give this restaurant a try. I went there at 11:30 and was informed politely that the restaurant would be opened at noon. The waitstaff asked if I'd like to have a drink first but I said I'll come back later.Coming back at 12noon and customers started piling up at the waiting area because the restaurant was still not ready as the staff were being briefed... (I do appreciate the professionalism, but if you tell your customer your restaurant will open at 12, shouldn't the briefing be done BEFORE that?). Actually, waited for almost 20minutes before being seated!!  It kinda made you feel you were being forgotten as there's no organised way of sitting the guests who have been waiting for a while and those who were just arriving! Atmosphere Quite casual, relaxing and friendly... the setting actually made you feel at ease. I quite like their stools at the waiting area which resembled a tin can (with the company logo of course). The background music (I assume Jazz?) was matching to the modern setting. It was quite crowded over lunchtime though.0Menu I was quite surprised that there was no lunch or drink menu until you asked... then the waiter would bring a HUGE piece of blackboard and explained to you about the Set Lunch (poor them... that thing looked quite inconvenient to carry). Though it's a nice gesture, I do think it'll be more pleasant if you actually present BOTH normal menu and lunch menu... otherwise the poor waiter will just be holding the large piece of blackboard while guests are struggling with options and checking back with main menu to check out the ingredients in selective pasta...Service From beginning to end, service was excellent! There seemed to be a good number of staff attending to guests' needs. Staff were attentive, responsive and polite, which this was the one consistent thing! They took initiative to top up water and check with you to see if the food was okay or if you need more cheese or pepper. Service staff were efficient and when they saw you have been waiting for main course for a long time, they would take initiative to check for you and let you know when it would be coming. FoodFood was just average... I ordered a Linguini Funghi Set lunch...1) At first I chose the minestrone instead of salad... this was what I got:0Oil spill in the soup >.<When I took the first sip... heavy layer of oil swamping around the tomatoes. Maybe the staff saw my horrid expression and did check with me if the soup was okay... and explained that the oil's there to enhance the flavour. He pleasantly offered to change it into salad if I were not pleased with it. It was bit disappointing because I could see good tomatoes in there... but totally spoiled by the excessive olive oil spill!Salad0Salad was a much pleasant find! The flavour was simple but mixed to a good acidity that appealed to your taste bud. The leaves were fresh and the tomatoes were juicy  2) the Pasta0It eventually came after a very long wait (around 40min?) and somehow was served warm instead of hot. I don't know why there seemed to be many staff around in the kitchen but it took them very long time to cook...Overall it's just average. The texture of the pasta was good and to my liking but the flavour was bit too salty. There was no rich sauce or anything but it was just plain salty. Not a lot of mushrooms but fair enough... but few pieces were a bit bitter. Could've been nicer if they use fresh button mushroom as well.3) The tea0OMG, did they wash the cup?! There were STAINS inside and outside the cup. This photo was actually taken before any tea was poured in!! Immediately the staff attended to me and apologetically changed the cup for me but it was disgusting!0It's nice that they served the tea and lemon separately but they seriously need to review the size of the tea cup. It might be perfect for coffee but too small indeed for tea (esp when two slices of lemon were stuck in there)!I guess this is a new restaurant and things are just starting to pick up?!

Central,Italian,"Name of restaurant: Al Dente, Soho, CentralDate/time of visit: 29/6 Wednesday 2:30pm Reason for going: Following our visit to Epoch Coffee Bar at Wanchai last time, we were keen to search for a better plate of pasta, somewhere that served traditional Italian pasta. After some thoughts, we agreed that Soho of Central had a great variety of western restaurants. Most of them were owned by westerners and the quality of food must be of a high quality to serve the higher class of residents living nearby. We therefore decided to try our luck there. The lunchtime of that day was raining dogs and cats. It was horrible. The rain was not heavy but it was the wind that made the matter worse. We could barely walk as we needed to fight with the wind. Unfortunately, we were bad navigators: we totally missed the long escalators connecting the Central MTR station and Soho. We took a longer path by climbing the steep streets instead. As a result, we were soaked by the time we arrived the restaurant after a 45 minutes walk from the MTR station.  What a great start for lunch! Inside Al Dente0Inside Al DenteAtmosphere: The restaurant was located in Staunton Street of Soho. It was quite a small restaurant comparing to other big ones nearby, yet we found the setting very homey. As the size of the shop was extremely small, the tables were closed to each other and seats were not comfortable when your shoulder is just a few inches away from the person by your side. Luckily, due to the rain, when we arrived, there were a few unoccupied tables. We were able to sit somewhere not too near to other customers. Food: We arrived at 2:30pm; we were just in time for the lunch set which lasted until 3pm. We chose Soup of the Day, Pasta of the Day and Tiramisu with ice cream.Soup of the Day0Soup of the Day0 Soup of the Day (Cream of Mushroom) The soup was served immediately after we had placed our order, probably because there were not many customers. A basket of bread was served alongside with the soup. We did not wait to taste the bread. To our surprise, the bread was soft and moist. It was warm and smelled of finely chopped fresh onion and herbs. We dipped the bread into some olive oil and black vinegar to enhance the taste  it was perfect.  We gave the bread a score of 9 out of 10. The soup had a fine taste, and the bread crumb in it had a herb flavor. However we found the soup too powdery. It was not smooth enough and did not blend with other ingredients. We preferred a thicker and creamier soup. Therefore we gave this soup a score of 6.5 out of 10.Pasta of the Day0Pasta of the Day Pasta of the Day (Linguine with Chicken and Mushroom in a White Wine Garlic Sauce) The pasta was splendid! When the pasta was served, the smell of garlic combining with white wine sauce was instantly released from the dishes and straight into our nostrils.  It was a very pleasurable virtual appetite without even trying the dish. The ingredients, chicken and mushroom, were cooked very well. The texture of the linguine was just right and we liked it. The portion of pasta was good enough for our appetite, we were not bloated when we finished. However we would recommend the dish be made less salty so that customers needed not keep drinking water. For the pasta, we gave a score of 8 out of 10. Tiramisu with ice cream0Tiramisu with ice cream Tiramisu with ice creamExpectations do not necessary get fulfilled when you have your hopes too high. This is true to our dessert. We anticipated a great ending to our meal  however, the dessert was too small comparing to our previous courses. The tiramisu was not smooth enough, not moisturized and not creamy at all. As for the ice cream, it was awful! It was the worst ice cream I ever had.  A three-star hotels tea buffet would do better than that. The vanilla ice cream was below average as it easily melted and tasted very artificial and had absolutely no vanilla taste at all. We gave this course a score of 3.5 out of 10. Service: The service was very good! The staff was nice and friendly. Most of the staff were Italians and were passionate about the quality of food and servicing. We could feel their genuine and sincere attitude. However, towards the end of our meal, we were rushed to leave as they had to fix their lights. It could have been better if we could stay longer to dry ourselves before we fought with the rain again. Overall, I think Al Dente was a good restaurant. I would like to visit it again to try out other soups and pasta of the day if I happen to pass by since there is no distinct aspect that attracts me to travel all the way from Kowloon.",Al Dente,3.8,110,nan,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-al-dente/9951?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

The mushrooms are really good!Baked mushrooms0Baked mushroomsGustosa pizza: This is one of the Pizza Leggera, which means lighter pizza. The middle of the pizza is filled with salad instead of dough.

Central,Italian,"Another fake Italian restaurant in town.We went there for lunch ytd and took the set-lunch.The roasted vegeable salad should be called roasted potatos salad, cause that's the only one inside.

Central,Italian,"I went here today since I was in the neighborhood. I went around 5:00 PM, neither lunch nor dinner time, but there was still a lot of people waiting there to get their pizza. I had to wait about five minutes or so until the lady even came back to the cashier place to take orders. I ordered a slice of their 24"" Hawaiian pizza to go. I waited for around ten to fifteen minutes which is actually quite a long time for just once slice of pizza. I was order no. 26 but others with orders 28 and 30 with around 3 to 6 slices got their orders earlier than mine!  I thought this was pretty frustrating. The service really could have been faster. Hawaiian Pizza Slice ($35)The size of the pizza looks pretty big and intimidating but, considering you usually eat 2 or 3 slices of pizza for a ""normal"" sized pizza, 1 slice of this giant pizza is a good portion size. The pizza is quite thin so it doesn't fill you up too much and make you feel really heavy. The cheese is really nice and melty, the toppings are okay, although it could always be a bit more generous. The only bad thing about the pizza was that there wasn't enough cheese on it, and also it was pretty greasy; I had to blot away the grease before I could eat it. Otherwise, though, the flavor is great.I would definitely come back here again to try their other items like calzones and, when they have it, their cannolis. Their pizza slices are also quite a good value.",Paisano's,3.6,35,10,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-paisanos/48665?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw
Central,Italian,"First I have to thank school for giving me one extra day-off, something which is much-needed in this hectic life of mine. Having no lessons at all (HURRAY!) I could enjoy great flexibility on my lunch-whereabouts. Having heard and read about the antipasti/salad bar lunch buffet, I could at last squeeze sometime to actually give it a try.Apparently Barolo had raised the price of the lunch sets by an average of +$20 as the waitress politely explained to me that the Salad Bar lunch set now costs $128 instead of $108, or $98 stated on its (apparently)outdated website. You get a salad bar buffet, pasta, dessert and tea/coffee by paying $138. This narrow difference of $10 is tempting but since we went only for the salad, we decided to give it a no-no and head for the salad bar instead.This place is actually more of a bar than a restaurant - we were allocated a bar table which was rather comfortable to sit and eat. The place was crowded with Central lunch-breakers who are mostly foreigners. They looked kinda in a rush - hurrying to return to their workplaces before the stock market opens again at 1:30?  As they buzz around like bees we just looked around lazily, and I felt quite funny being surrounded by people constantly moving swiftly while I was completely in the holiday mood, wanting just to sit back and relax a bit.  After a few minutes of relaxation we could at last move our asses off the comforty bar chairs and moved to inspect the salad bar spread.Impressive spread of antipasti0Impressive spread of antipasti What we saw was indeed impressive: plates after plates of fresh salads and antipasti were laid on the long bar table.What a scene. You actually start from the right of the bar to the left were the espresso machine is: first were the soup, bread and plain salad veggies, then the cheese and the cold cuts and the grills, and last were the fruits. There were approximately 15~20 kinds of food available.Bland goat cheese0Bland goat cheeseConventionally I started with the plain salads and bread: the  bread basket offered at least 3 kinds of bread including french baguettes, flaxseed wholewheat buns and a sour dough. Pity that they had been dehydrated under the strong ventilation, but they actually tasted okay with the crunchy crust and soft(if you tear away the tough parts which has exposed in air for too long), and i guess they should go well with the  cream of mushroom soup , which i did not bother to try. Nice  salad veggies tho and there were four dressings which you could choose from, plus some really nice and crunchy croutons, cheese(is it cheddar or edam?cant tell) wedges and thin crisps which you could top your salad with, not to mention the really juicy cherry tomato which went well with the thousand island dressing. The Tomato with Mozzarella looked better than it tasted as the cheese was a bit rubbery in texture but literally tasteless. The comment applies for the goat cheese  which, sadly, did not even tasted like cheese at all but resembled crumbled soap.  This was really disappointing as i was expecting quite a lot from its cheese collection...anyway, theres still other antipasti which i could give my heart to.   Smoked salmon  was okay but tasted a little too salty, but that could be moderated by a good squeeze of lemon juice.Some were good, some were bad0Some were good, some were badNext I basically sampled with EVERYTHING ON ONE SINGLE PLATE!!WOHOO! luckily most were vegetables or else i would have killed myself for gorging in so much meat and fat in one single meal. Parma ham that you should not miss0Parma ham that you should not missAnyway, the  parma ham  was truly delicious - they were of the correct thickness and were not too fat nor salty; the cantaloupe was sweet and went well with the ham.  Matter of fact I thought the parma ham here tasted better than what's served at Tiffin's or The Lounge@J.W. Marriott!  There was the big wedges of  grilled pumpkin  which i treated myself generous shares as they were truly delicious. You have to pick the softer ones as they were better seasoned. They were quite buttery in texture and I just used them to 'butter' the dry bread! There were two drier mixes of chicken peas  and some suspicious seed-like stuff, which i did not quite like. The  Grilled mushrooms and zucchini and eggplants  were nicely grilled and juicy, however; the  clam salad and grilled broccoli and cauliflower was disappointing however as they were not too fresh nor tasty.  Fresh fruits0Fresh fruitsLast were the fruits - the pineapple, cantaloupe and watermelon  were all fresh, juicy and sweet.Lovely Biscotti0Lovely BiscottiWe ordered two English breakfast teas which came with a lovely piece of almond biscotti , which served as the most appropriate 'petite sweetness' to the salad buffet lunch.Now perhaps you will ask: wheres the oyster? I was thinking of the same question and apparently Barolo had taken away quite a lot of food from the lunch menu. Stuff like the cheese variety and some seafood items were missing. That was indeed a huge disappointment, given that they had raised the charge per head from $108 to $128.  Had i been aware of the changing menu, I would not have been here for lunch - it is not very economical of me to have a salad lunch at $128+s.c.To conclude - great place and great service, the food was okay, but the choice was a bit too narrow given that the restaurant is charging people around $135 per head. Perhaps i should have tried Bistecca Italian Steak House or Bourbon instead.",Barolo,3.6,135,nan,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-barolo/42510?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

Their couscous is quite good, the mixed seafood salad's good too. Most other choices are well flavored.  Wish there were more cheese selections and perhaps some crackers to go with.One thing to note - the bread basket could be better. A bit stale and cold. For main course I had the mushroom and thyme tagiatelle. Not bad but nothing spectacular. The desserts are better than I expected!

Central,Italian,"Inflation is coming, but finding a good quality restaurant with economy price in Central seems not to be a big question. Arriving there, we recognized it's been 1, so we looked for a nice dining for lunch. We walked from Central to Lan Kwai Fong, then to Stanuton Street, which was the heart of SOHO, finally we chose this Italian restaurant. Actually when I had a look at the menu, the thing that surprised me the most was the price. Located in SOHO, I could hardly imagine how did this restaurant survive (I mean the cost might be even higher than the price). So we decided to have a try. My dad and I each got a beef, with salad and soup ($88) being as the side order. My mom preferred to have something light, so she ordered a pasta with seafood ($88+10).I really enjoyed such ambiance, quiet, cosy with dim lighting, which reminded me of traveling to Europe in the past. In fact, I really enjoyed studying or relaxing in such atmosphere, especially when I felt sad. After sitting down, talking, enjoying, our set lunch came. First, it's our bread. The bread tasted like the ones in Western surpermarket, with sliced onions topped on the bread. Then, it's my salad. Nothing special, but the taste was not bad at all. Next, my beef. Oops... why didn't the waitress ask how would I like it done? Perhaps it's not a traditional steakhouse. But my steak was quite tasty, I could taste the tenderness of my beef. Every slice mixed with side veggies, moderating the sense of meaty and bulkiness. After, there's my hot coffee and finally my desert. The desert tasted kinda like pavlova, a common desert in New Zealand. I really loved the combination of creaminess and crumby. Haha!Overall, this Italian cuisine was really worth trying, particularly in a Saturday/Sunday afternoon. If there's a magazine, newspaper or fiction, it sounds better.00000",La Piazzetta,4.1,100,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-la-piazzetta/1788?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

Central,Italian,"Set lunch: Ham with Autumn SaladPumpkin Ravioli($330)Honey Vanilla Cheese Cake.(+$60)Excellent.The theme of my fantastic lunch is ""balance"".  All three courses featured interesting flavors or textures which by themselves threaten to overpower you, but are swiftly brought back in line by the other components of the dish.I wasn't planning on writing a review, so there is only a photo of the dessert.Ham with Autumn SaladThe ham is some Spanish ham, not Iberico.  Slightly damp and by itself, salty.The salad contains a profusion of ingredients which I assume are seasonal, including quite a few fungi/mushrooms, leaves, nuts, and other shavings that I didn't quite recognize.  By themselves, a hopeless jumble that is soggy and crunchy.But when you take the ham with the salad, you find that the meat provides a solid foundation.  Leaves are no longer bitter, fungi is no longer overpowering, the nuts are not as noticeable, and the ham is no longer just salty.  I wish I could explain further but it just ...works.Pumpkin RavioliWhen I saw the subheading for this item in the set menu I was worried.  ""Butter and Parmesan"".  Wouldn't that make a super heavy pasta?  Pumpkin is not known to be a light vegetable.  The way the chef prepared the pumpkin was to beat it almost into a cream.  I didn't notice the parmesan, but the butter made the pumpkin very smooth and yes, heavy.  But when I started to find the pasta weighing down my tongue, some surprise herb (mint? not quite) emerged from the dish and uplifted the texture.  It was gone in an instant, but it achieves the effect of making the ravioli creamy but not heavy.The portion is good.Honey Vanilla Cheese Cake with berry compote and mandarin sorbetAnother dazzler.  The sorbet and berry compote were very sour.  The cheese cake was solid and mildly sweet.  If you are the type of person who eats their dessert part by part, this is a failure.  But if you take the parts together, wow.  There is that balance again - the cheese cake is the bass supporting the soprano berries and alto sorbet.  Excellent value at $60 extra.DownsidesThere are, of course, negative aspects to be found in every restaurant.  In Hong Kong, quite often the training of the staff is lacking.  Otto e Mezzo is not an exception.While the staff are reasonably diligent in delivering courses, taking away dishes, and pointing you to the bathroom, they are not very attentive to other duties.  Refilling water, for example.  Also, simply because the wine glasses are large, does not mean you should pour a ton of wine into the glass.  You should only pour up to the widest level of the glass at the very maximum.  It is interesting how so many waiters fail this test.  The staff should also look out for customers raising their hands to call for whatever.ConclusionCompared to the standard of the food though, my misgivings at the service are really quite minor.  Do give this new restaurant a go.  I might even return in the near future to try their degustation.Honey Vanilla Cheese Cake0Honey Vanilla Cheese Cake",8 Otto e Mezzo BOMBANA,4.5,400,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-8-otto-e-mezzo-bombana/41122?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

But there really is nothing too special about the bread basket. Squid ink really is just the color. There is nothing special to its taste. Tomato  - tasted a bit weird actually. Herbed - fair. But the hummus + garlic spread I must commend - most tasty and irresistable!  I could've consumed the small dish alone. Sadly had to split it among 4. Hmph. Could try making the spread myself...shouldn't be too difficult.  Mixed green salad  Basic green salad 0 Basic green salad Has tomatoes, rocket, red onion, cabbage, sun-dried tomatoes.....got all the ingredients right (would've fancied some romaine, or baby spinach)..but it was too oily, too salty, too sour. I think they seriously got the proportions wrong. If the proportions were right it would've been a rather nice salad. By the time i was halfway through this salad, oil was practically dripping from my lips. I had to wipe away the excess oil with a napkin. That ought not have happened.

But i don't like clam so yeah. mm.Linguine with sauteed seabass and puttanesca sauce (spicy!)seabass linguine with cherry tomatoes0seabass linguine with cherry tomatoesEssentially it contained cherry tomatoes, black olives, seabass cubes and garlic cloves. It was quite spicy but the linguine was cooked al dente. I'd have preferred it less hot. The seabass wasn't very fresh I think - And the skin was slimy - which I don't like. Fish with skin should be seared on both sides until the skin becomes super crisp; another technique Jamie Oliver taught was to de-skin the fish (without completely detaching the fish from the thin layer that holds it together), that way you could sear both sides of the skin and there would be NO SLIMY SKIN at all. Slimy skin on steamed fish is fine. They ought not have sauteed it - please get rid of slimy skin!! >< Chargrilled salmon steak with herbs n' mayo sauce chargrilled salmon0chargrilled salmonDisappointing. I might not have realized that it was salmon had I not been informed beforehand...in other words, bad. Perhaps it wasn't properly seasoned..? Not enough salt? Should salmon steak be seasoned or marinated? Yes if you want it to taste special, like this supertasty miso-marinated fatty salmon G made a month ago - but that aside, salmon doesn't need a lot of treatment to be yummy right?  something must've gone wrong with the steak itself then. It wasn't very dry so I don't think they overcooked it. The bed of greens accompanying the steak was just as oily, sour and salty as the starter. and it consisted of roughly the same ingredients.  Not sincere. Chargrilled sirloin steaksirloin steak0sirloin steakAgain, not a fan of huge slabs of meat...so I didn't try this one. But according to D it's one of the best steaks he's had! Cooked medium, it was juicy and tender. i trust D's judgment because he orders steak whenever it is on the menu. Regardless of other tempting choices - I guess men are like that? Parma ham and shallots thin crust pizzathin crust parma ham pizza0thin crust parma ham pizza This pizza had a firm base and crisp sides. I like these crusts (stark difference from PHD/PH pizzas) - they don't add empty carbs to my already carb-filled diet.  Good. Parma ham was a bit too salty for my taste but I'd call this a pizza I enjoyed. The waiter recommended that we roll up each slice from the outer rim and eat it like roll so that with each bite, we get a bit of everything - salty, chewy stringy cheese, plus the extra crunch of the crisp crust. yummy! The dough is freshly made each day. I'd recommend this restaurant's pizzas. Conclusion:Might come back again to try out the other pizzas - I spotted a couple that I really wanna try on the pizza menu - Salmon, primavera, al funghi (my fave).",Via 28 Ristorante,2.8,120,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-via-28-ristorante/43996?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

Central,Italian,"I seldom dine in LKF/ Soho. To me, the restaurants in these areas don't serve good food. They are only for drinks and parties, which I am not fond of. Thanks to the group-buying promotions, I recently got the incentive to break my prejudice and try a few places around these areas. I purchased this 3-course buffet lunch offer, $215 nett for 2 ppl. Thinking that my mother would like to have some quality food, I invited her to go with me. Im a buffet freak, so I looked forward to this day.Finally came the Day. W52 occupies the G/F & 1/F of a narrow building capturing an alleyway as its outdoor terrace area.  Its chic outlook and design blends well with the location. Contemporary bar on ground and a cozy restaurant on the upper level. Indoor space is not large, but still allows six tables to comfortably spaced on one side, and maybe a few more tables on the other side. Elevator is in the middle. Antipasti table, with a large variety of appetizers like fresh greens, Parma ham with melon and fresh fig, smoked salmon, cheese platter, zucchini mousse, pasta salad, Russell sprouts, tuna Carpaccio ..., is set right at the entrance. Next to this table at the corner is the dessert table neatly displaying more than 10 types of 5-star dessert, from tarts, mixed fruits, 3 types of cakes, bread & butter pudding, mango custard filled crepe, puff, tiramisu, panna cotta, to crme brle. We received friendly service from the waiters. The manager was there at the beginning to oversee the operation of the lunch session. Our lunch set also includes 1 main course, selected from 3 items. My mother and I both chose the fettuccini with capers, anchovy, tomato and olive. There were actually three other items on the menu that we could choose at an extra cost + 10% charge. After taking the order, a lovely bread basket with 4 kinds of fresh and warm bread was set on our table, including a special squid-ink roll, crispy Italian breadstick, baguette, and spongy focaccia. I asked the waiter for olive oil & balsamic vinegar  perfect partners for focaccia. I was delighted that he gave me a red label - balsamic vinegar that has been aged for at least 12 yrs. I also asked for Tabasco, black pepper and parmesan, the waiters brought them up to me with great efficiency and always WITH A SMILE!  That's what you call quality service. No complaint at all about the quality of the food on the buffet table. Having a taste of each dish can already make a lady full.The fettuccini was nicely done, though it could be more al dente. Also, the kitchen may need better quality control cos my mothers dish was quite dry without olive and capers, while mine was well mixed with sauce and ingredients. To my own surprise, I finished up the dish! W52 might not be the best restaurant that Ive visited, but it scores high on everything  from service, food, presentation to hygiene. A little complaint I might have is that my fork was not properly cleaned, but the waiter apologized twice to me and promptly changed it for me upon my request. Oh, here is a bonus - every customer got a souvenir - a cute pack of toothpicks made with natural Japanese wood  no bleach, no chemical. A final note to the restaurant:  the table of young female Caucasians were laughing and talking out loud and disrupting other customers, well, me and my mother to be exact. If the restaurant manager or captain could do something to deal with this kind of situational problem and keep the dining place pleasant, that would be an extra credit to W52.",W52,4.6,108,5,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-w52/37558?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

Can see very clearly on how they cook it.I ordered Japanese Clams Spaghetti.Its awesome that they have EVERYTHING pre-packed.  I.e. Spaghettie are in small individual packets like instant noodles, the cook just dump it in boiled water to cook it.  Every portion of the clams are packed and cooked together already.  Np wonder they can serve in just a few minutes as they only need to reheat the sauce and ingredients and boil the spaghetti.I saw that their clams packages have Japanese markings on the box....hint they should be from JP then.My spaghetti was fairly pleasant and it got like 17 clams...more than I expected.The sauce was  and quite match with the clams.The spaghetti was also chewy.The portion here are just right, won't be over or under.

Central,Italian,"Highly Recommended. This is a jewel in SoHo. Despite the fact that the location SoHo connotes good food and good drink in good company, once you've been and out of it often enough you would soon realize that it is not the case. Businesses have been shuttering often lately and new restaurants are everywhere. But Cecconi has been here for quite a while, and I think there must be a reason why it managed to remain competitive. Ambiance: semi-open kitchen0semi-open kitchenThe ceiling looks quite low when you peep into the restaurant. Yes, the shop front is. But the back has a much higher ceiling - less oppressive. An open kitchen with a marble counter top and 3 heat lamps completes the back of the restaurant. There's a small partition between the front and back - a cupboard i think. And a wishing tree.  There are slips of paper clipped onto it. Quite chic. Velvety sofas, and a round table at the corner, for a party of 4-5. Service:Quite lousy, seriously.  inattentive and sporadic. H wanted hot water but got lukewarm tap water instead, and the waiter had to be reminded of the request. The guy who took our orders did not manage to note that D wanted 2 starters and 1 mains, and seemed to be utterly confused when we repeated our order.  disappointing. But when the chef (making tiramisu behind the counter) noticed that I was taking pics and making notes, I overheard him tell the manager, who came over and asked if everything was alright. He also asked me what magazine I was writing for. Openrice, I told him. From his response, I could tell he obviously wasn't much aware of the influence OR has over diners in HK. hah!Prices: Fair. 3 courses for $140, (10% included) not bad. not bad at all for the quality.

Generous parmesan shavings (could've offered less actually  i'm not crazy about cheese), proper romaine hearts, very crisp and cheesy crouton, evenly coated dressing, anchovies...(gave them away), bacon bits, and the thin slice of ovened bread.

I'm not a big fan. Too much rocket isn't nice, to be honest - it's peppery, numbs your tongue and its taste is too strong. As in, I'd love having rocket mixed into a salad containing other leaves, but i do not prefer a stand-alone rocket salad. However, the sweet poached pear complemented it well - and so did the thin disc of provolone (cheese). Really - pear with rocket is an excellent combination - we used to make it at home, only we used canned pears, because the syrup from the can of pears can be mixed into the dressing linguine ai olio with mixed veg linguine ai olio with mixed veg0linguine ai olio with mixed vegDoes it sound boring to you?

But then the more you eat the spicier it gets.  gnocchi with tomato, basil and aged balsamic gnocchi w/ tomato, pesto, aged balsamic0gnocchi w/ tomato, pesto, aged balsamici have decided that i do not know how to appreciate this dish. gnocchi is a carb ball. a chewy paste. didn't find it attractive at all...drowning in the red cheese and tomato and basil sauce....there were leftovers. a lot of it too. that's a statement. would Cecconi consider removing gnocchi from the menu?  pan-seared barramundi pan-seared barramundi0pan-seared barramundiD said the fish was good but i prefer the pasta dishes! somehow they satisfy me...i am a shameless pasta lover! i had a bite. the skin was very crisp, not scaly at all and not slimy. good. hate slimy skin. Fresh barramundi, no fishiness, white and flaky flesh. not a lot of seasoning but then if the quality of the fish is excellent in itself, heavy seasoning is not called for   chocolate ginger cheesecakechocolate ginger cheesecake0chocolate ginger cheesecakeso damn good. best thing about it is, it's not too sweet. candied ginger embedded inside cake. a bit crumbly. feels very much like cheesecake though. i think they must've used some cocoa powder. you...just have to try it out for yourself  Authentic tiramisu Authentic tiramisu0Authentic tiramisuIt's not the best tiramisu I've had in Hong Kong, but it's definitely one of the best I had as of late. The best one i've had was homemade, ha, ironic. But we don't make tiramisu anymore because mum is paranoid about the raw egg whites. hmph. Will find her a substitute and then I can have tiramisu at home. This one: lady fingers soaked up a lot of that tia maria (or the like), was COLD enough (good good), in the vanilla sauce you could see them vanilla pods  and i appreciated the almond biscuit flakes. Not too rich (a good thing!) But as desserts go, I did wishfully hope it'd be a tad sweeter Conclusion:My 5th visit will be with another party. Can't wait to try the new stuff Cecconi offers!",Cecconi's Italian,3.5,140,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-cecconis-italian/18311?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw
Central,Italian,"Dcor: Contemporary white with lots of floor to ceiling glasses introducing natural light and offering an excellent view of the harbor, in particular, if you dine al fresco.Ambiance: very busy and lively as usual Sitting: reasonably spacious for some business discussionsService: well trained and efficient... courteous? Not necessarily just well trained.Wine list: did not look at it over lunch. Last time I dine there, I remember they have a good wine list of Italian wines.Food: The antipasti buffet is excellent and offers a wide variety of choices. The sword fish was nice and moist, which is a delightful change from the traditional dry and tough servings. The dessert buffet could include a couple more choices of cakes. Food quality is good while the portions are reasonable.Cost: $900 for three for lunch inclusive of service charge, mineral water and coffee.Value for Money?  7.5/10 General: I have been there many times and Isola is habitually good for business luncheons.",Isola Bar & Grill,nan,300,0,www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-isola-bar-grill/11637?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
