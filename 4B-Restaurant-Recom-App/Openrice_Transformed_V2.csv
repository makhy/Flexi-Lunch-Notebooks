0, CHIRASHI,Wan Chai,Japanese,3.7,488.0,0.0,"0Chirashi is a popular Japanese don restaurant located on Wan Chai Road between Wan Chai and Causeway Bay. The restaurant is cozy restsaurant serving big bowls of sashimi don and some other Japanese food at the reasonable price.0000The restaurant is well stocked with a wide range of Japanese rice wine as well as a display of sashimi. Besides, they only use Japanese rice which would be a lot stickier than Chinese/Thai rice.00We have ordered a  which is to share among 2 ppl for $488. The don has two layers with the bottom layer filled with Japanese rice with crab roes and the top layer covered with different types of sashimi, including uni tofu, tamago roll, salmon roe, salmon, octopus, Matsuba crab and more!0We were recommended to have the uni tofu first, then the tamago.0Moving on to the array of sashimi, and you can enjoy the sashimi along with the crab legs. Among them, I liked the crab the most because of its strong seawater flavour and the sea water literally comes out once you bite into it.0Afterward, you may move on to the body of the crab because it has a stronger taste when comparing to the legs of the crab.00Some ginger sauce is also provided on the side for you to dip the fresh crab meat in. The taste of the crab changed and the sweetness intensify afterward. A great alternative to enjoy this delicate crab meat.00000The rice underneath is generous enough to share among two ppl, it looked big but it's actually a very thin layer. The rice has been mixed with some shrimp roe with a big dollop of crab roe in the middle. The crab roe tasted very strong with a savoury taste. Therefore, it's best to enjoy with some rice. 00Some crab meat is also mixed in with the rice, therefore I also liked to take the meat out from the crab and mix that into the rice for more flavour!000The body of the crab has a strong flavour as I have mentioned before. The sea water taste is very strong and the meat is still very juicy with firmed.0You can also ask for a pot of crab soup to make a soup rice after some time. The crab soup is hot with a flavourful sweetness and natural seafood taste. A great way to lighten up the taste from the crab roe.To me personally, I really enjoyed to have the rice with the soup because it heated up the rice and it is very hearty when it is enjoyed with some liquid.000Overall, for $488, I think it is quite expected ass it is very big in size and the presentation was just amazing. For $244 each person, it's not bad to have this amount of sashimi as well as Matsuba crab all in one sitting! I would come back again if I want to have some fun time with friends de-shelling the crab as well as enjoying a delicious meal!0""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/wan-chai-%E5%BC%98-chirashi/470956?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
1, X ,Causeway Bay,Chinese,3.6,60.0,0.0,"There are a number of Ki's Roast Goose restaurants in the Causeway Bay vicinity but this place called  (Ki's Roast Goose x Gwing Kee Noodles) is a combined restaurant with the popular Tsuen Wan Gwing Kee noodle shop. A noodle shop known for making excellent lo mein, a dry noodle mixed with soy sauce and goose fat. I guess it makes sense to just use the goose drippings from Ki's Roast Goose. So, the two became one!The menu is in English and Chinese. There is no 10% service charge. You can choose just the roast meats with rice or with Gwing Kee's thick noodles. Which is what I did. Ordered a roast goose and char siu combo for $58. It comes with a hot drink.The noodles were ok. Chewy consistency and you can definitely taste the fat.0The roast meat was fantastic. The goose was tender, the skin not too fat. The char siu was a great consistency of fat to meat content. It also wasn't overly sweet.0Overall, the meat was pretty good. Noodles were ok though I needed a bit more sauce as it started to get a bit too dry.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-%E6%A3%8B%E5%93%A5%E7%87%92%E9%B5%9D-x-%E7%82%AF%E8%A8%98%E9%A4%90%E5%AE%A4/588528?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
2,10 Shanghai,Causeway Bay,Chinese,3.2,120.0,,"1957 & Company (company behind Paper Moon and Mango Tree) continued flexing their muscles in Causeway Bay this month. Having already launched Gonpachi and An Nam at Lee Garden, the hospitality group recently added a third restaurant to the mix with 10 Shanghai ().010 Shanghai is a stylish Shanghainese restaurant serving delicate Huaiyang cuisine with a modern twist.0The first thing I noticed about this place, without even touching the food menu, was the noise level in the dining hall. The tables were a little too close to one other and it was almost like sitting besides a bunch of high-performance speakers and subwoofers. I can really feel the sound waves bouncing off my body left and right.0But I have to admit, I like their food menu and there're a number of reasons behind. For one, it has pretty good coverage including snacks (3 pages on this section alone), seafood, soup, meat and poultry, vegetables, dim sum, rice and noodle, and dessert. Prices are pretty reasonable considering it's located in a prime location in Causeway Bay and last but not least, the contemporary twist on some of the classical dishes, it's a breath of fresh air.0Crispy bean curd roll with black truffle () ($98) - I have always been a big fan of crispy bean curd rolls, or vegetarian goose as it's often called. These were pretty nice and good work by the black truffle sauce to make them even more tasty (Grade: 7/10).Crispy bean curd roll with black truffle ()...$ 980Crispy bean curd roll with black truffle ()...$ 98Pan-fried Xiao Long Bao () ($60) - I have had a lot of xiao long baos (Shanghainese pork dumplings) in my life but it was my very first thing having them on a frying pan.Pan-fried Xiao Long Bao ()$ 600Pan-fried Xiao Long Bao ()$ 60The wrappers were surprisingly thin (you won't be able to tell from the photos at all!) but the broth seemed to have evaporated from the heated pan.

But this turns out to be more like a woba (or rice crispies/) (Grade: 5/10).0Shanghainese style stir-fried noodle () ($108) - Pretty tasty and not as greasy as the ones from most traditional Shanghainese restaurants (Grade: 7/10).Shanghainese style stir-fried noodle ()$ 1080Shanghainese style stir-fried noodle ()$ 108Stewed noodle with chicken () ($58) - This one was ordered for my little one.Stewed noodle with chicken ()$ 580Stewed noodle with chicken ()$ 58I can tell the noodles were a little too soft (and soaky) but my little nugget had no complaints (Grade: 4.5/10).0There were some hit-and-misses here and there but I thought the dim sums and snacks were quite nice. They've got to do something with the noise level though. It's supposed to be an upscale restaurant but it felt more like a cha chaan teng as we had to literally yell at each other to get our conversation going.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-10-shanghai/559312?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

4,1963 ,Wan Chai,Chinese,3.6,113.3,2.0,"00This shop in Wanchai is located on the 2nd floor of an old building, its main entrance is located at Wanchai Road with unique decoration of the exterior of the building. While this gives a wrong impressison to diners that the restaurant occupies the whole building, it creates a sense of uniqueness to visitors coming from the Wanchai Road entrance. Your visit starts like entering a time machine, which brings you from 2016 back to the year of 1963.00000When you entered the restaurant, it is fully decorated by vintage furniture and creates a relaxing feeling of reminiscing the past. Old clocks which the date and time was halt at one specific moment in the past, old word infuser which was widely used before the invention of automatic printing machines.00The decoration of this shop is definitely the attraction of this restaurant, instead of solely providing Taiwanese food, the atmosphere offers diners a transient visit to the old times in Taiwan, with authentic vintage styles telephones and simple decorations. On one hand, this could promote the idea of recycling, as diners could have a chance to rethink the use of something which is considered outdated. On the other hand, reviving the old furniture (and even window frames) and decorations could help diners immerse into homely feeling of going back to the past, which is the theme of the restaurant. The walls are all painted with vintage style colours.000The restaurant occupies the whole 2nd floor of the building, which is very big, however, it is always crowded with diners, especially during lunch hours on both weekdays and weekends. Booking can be done via telephone, but it would be more secure if you book 1 or 2 weeks in advance for lunch hours in this restaurant.The menu of this restaurant is very simple, which is consistent with the decoration and the atmosphere as a whole.The lunch sets are around HK$70  HK$90, and diners can choose to order drinks by adding HK$15 or above. The drinks are mostly Taiwanese drinks handmade in the drinks bar.0I have been to this shop twice and ordered the following food:- (HK$70) (Taiwanese Style Chicken Rice)$ 700$ 700The taste of the chicken is very strong in wine smell, the presentation of the lunch set looks like those Korean sets, with small dishes at side and small bowl of rice. On top of the chicken, there are spices to add colours and taste to the dish.00Some dried sakura shrimps are placed on top of the rice together with some sliced chicken, the taste of the rice is very unique. The variety of side dishes provides sensational excitement for diners. The sour tomatoes can initiate diners appetite. (HK$70) (Old Fashioned Sauce Pork Chop Rice)00The pork chop bone is placed on the dish to show the whole piece of pork chop. The taste of the pork chop is not those delicate type, but with very strong dipped sauce inside the meat texture. Taiwanese style minced pork is placed on top of rice. (HK$68) (Crispy Chicken Leg Rice)0The chicken skin is very crispy and there is no additional flour placed outside the skin of the chicken. My friend has also ordered a rose coffee together with the set and she said that the coffee is surprisingly good. There are also biscuits coming along with the coffee.Rose Latte0Rose LatteThe chopsticks in this restaurant are very special too, this restaurant provides a relaxing and humorous atmosphere for diners to enjoy Taiwanese food.0Interesting Chopsticks0Interesting ChopsticksMy 2 visits are evidenced by the reciepts below:00The lunch menus are attached for reference:-0100Supplementary InformationPlease make your booking early in advance!', '0Entering this place was like going back to the year 1963 with a layer of fancy vintage interior and a touch of Taiwanese aura over the place1# $68 (8/10)First of all, the portion of the chicken steak was huge Although the texture of the chicken meat was soft, it was overrided by hardness of the chicken skin which was overly thick and crispy and made it hard to chew on The spicy and tangy flavoured sauce drizzled on top of the chicken was not too preferred for my liking because I like my meat savoury but the good part taiwanese rice which was the perfect mix of fatty pork meat and rice in the meal#($70)The pork meat portion again was huge but the flavour was a bit salty though the fatty pork rice was once again not disappointing to my palate 0#+$23 (8/10)Whilst eating Taiwan food, you can also enjoy their coffee and relax in the comfort of the cozy environment the rose latte was presented beautifully with cute biscuits that come at the side the latte was smooth and creamy with a strong coffee aftertaste and a hint of rose aroma000000001', ""I saw these colorful social media photos of this restaurant and I had this absolute need to come find it. Dragging boyfriend, it was oddly easy yet not easy to find. Situated in a building in Wanchai that I walk by very often, I didn't notice there was ever a door in. You go up the a few flights of stairs, leaving you huffing and puffing where you will find a door.We did later discover they do have an elevator. We took it on the way down and found that they do suggest you walk up the stairs. But if you do use the elevator, you are to call their phone number for them to open the door.0Entering the restaurant, you'll find that you've stepped into the 1960s. The whole restaurant has all sorts artificats that you would find from the past. They even play music that you'd probably find in a Wong Kar Wai movie. It had that whole In The Mood for Love feel.0Menu is in Chinese only. There are no photos. So, I guess if you really want to eat here and you can't read English, Google translate is your friend. What they serve is various Taiwanese type dishes. It kind of reminded me of the Kwun Tong restaurant, Skoool and I wonder if they are the same group?All staff speak Mandarin. I guess to keep with the feeling that you are in Tawain.We were here for lunch so they only had lunch sets available.Pork Chop with Minced Beef Rice ($65).Boyfriend chose this as his lunch set. The pork chop was a bit dry and a bit too salty. The minced beef was actually quite good. Not too salty and not too oily.0Braised Beef Brisket and Tendon Noodles ($65).This was my set. I loved how they used such beautiful plates. The beef was tender and just fell apart easily. The noodles were still al dente. Though the soup base wasn't very strong on flavor, I still thought it was ok.0Each set came with an appetizer of salted mini fish, sour plum marinaded cherry tomatoes and spinach. I thought it was a nice little appetizer just to wet the palate.0Ice Wintermelon Tea ($15).Boyfriend chose this as his drink. There is no actual set drink but you can add money for drinks that include anything from coffee to juice. This is ice wintermelon tea and boyfriend loved it. He said it tasted exactly like how they have it in Taiwan. It was not only sweet but there was a hint of smokiness. He claimed that he couldn't get this exact taste in Hong Kong.0Red and White Dragon Fruit Juice ($22).I chose this. It was basically the dragon fruit juice but they used both red and white to make it look pretty. But basically dragon fruit juice. It felt super healthy but nothing amazing about it. It was just juice so I don't think it was worth $22.0A beautiful environment where the food looked beautiful as well. I felt serrving size was ok but for boyfriend, it wasn't enough. Prices were also a bit steep for an upstairs cafe but I guess rent also costs more in Wanchai. I would return again.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/wan-chai-1963-%E6%9C%A8%E5%8D%81%E8%B1%86%E5%AF%B8/487324?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

6,298 Nikuya Room,Central,Japanese,4.6,315.0,0.0,"Suddenly craved Yakiniku and saw that comments on this place were generally good, especially for lunch. Then I recalledthat a friend of mine had recommended this place before so I decided to give it a try. However, I was asked to pick a time slot of either 12-1pm or 1-2pm when I called to make a reservation, which made it quite rushy especially when the food arrived quite late and we did order some extra items on top of the set.00There were quite some people when I arrived shortly after 12p.m. and I was seated at the bar table.Each of us ordered a 298 Wagyu BBQ Set which included 3 pieces of thick cut Wagyu and 4 types of sliced Wagyu (2 slices each type). We also ordered some extra Ox Tongue. Some of the waiters didn't know much when we asked them what were included in the set but one was more knowledgeable and was happy to tell us the order and way of eating the different types of Wagyu.I think it took at least 15 min for our food to arrive after ordering, even the appetizers and side dishes, which was why I was a bit shocked when they asked us to check out at 1p.m. because we didn't mean to be late!298 Wagyu BBQ Set: Appetizers & side dishes$ 3280298 Wagyu BBQ Set: Appetizers & side dishes$ 328Here you go the appetisers and side dishes for our 298 Wagyu BBQ set. A drink was also included in our set. We ordered Coke Zero and Cream Soda respectively. You could also choose Ginger beer, Ginger Ale, Oolong Tea, Green Tea or coffee. So the set included salad,Kimchi, spicy beef with tofu, ox tongue, miso soup and rice. The rice was a bit disappointing becauseit was just very average rice. Not even local rice of better quality. But you could ask for more for free.298 Wagyu BBQ Set$ 3280298 Wagyu BBQ Set$ 328The Wagyu for our 298 set which included three pieces of thick cut Wagyu and 4 types of sliced Wagyu each with two pieces.

He also told us that they needed to be fully cooked. He also recommended that we could add some lemon juice to them after being cooked. Really need to add lemon juice after eating quite a few because they got quite salty as you ate more.Ox Tongues0Ox TonguesThe ox tongues, even fully cooked, were very tender. Great texture!Thick Cut Ox Tongues0Thick Cut Ox TonguesThen we started cooking the thick cut ox tongues and the vegetables in our 298 Wagyu BBQ set.Thick Cut Ox Tongue0Thick Cut Ox TongueThe thick cut ox tongue, even fully cooked, was so so tender still! I really liked the  yet tender texture!Thick Cut Wagyu & Ox Tongues0Thick Cut Wagyu & Ox TonguesThen we started cooking the other two pieces of thick cut Wagyu while cooking the last round of extra ox tongues. One thick cut was meat near the pat pat while another seemed to be chuck roll . So bad we forgot which was which.Thick Cut Wagyu0Thick Cut WagyuThick Cut Wagyu0Thick Cut WagyuAlthough we couldn't really distinguish these 2 pieces of thick cut Wagyu by tastes, both of them were really surprisingly tender. Normally I don't like thick cut beef but these thick cut Wagyu really pleased me!Harami 0Harami Again we followed the recommended order of the knowledgeable waiter and cooked Harami .

A lunch visit is highly recommended. Just don't expect you can have a lot of time to enjoy the food."", ""A colleague recommended this place for its weekday lunch set, saying it's really a bargain especially when compared to its expensive prices for dinner. It is really unusual for us to have Japanese BBQ (or any kind of BBQ) for lunch on a weekday. No matter how much I liked Jap BBQ, I could not imagine bearing with that smell afterwards.We ordered a Wagyu beef set, a shabu set and a seasonal beef selection set for sharing.000The sets range from $150 to $250, with salad, soup and rice included.You can actually tell from the photos what kind of quality the beef is of. The sets definitely have (very) acceptable prices in Central (you'll understand if you work nearby) given its quality. You will be amazed how nice the texture is. The beef is such high quality that you probably cannot criticise for its high price for dinner.I was glad that my colleague recommended this place. It's definitely a nice short getaway for the sore from work. But make sure you do not have a client meeting in the afternoon or else you will still get yourself embarrassed (again,no matter how nice its beef is, the smell is inevitable...)""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-298-nikuya-room/180200?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

The first staff refused to admit that the order was wrong, but then another came over and kindly took the extra 5 away. These babies were juicy. The taste was not bad, but the flavour of ginger was quite strong. 0Service:The service was a mix of good and bad. Some were nice and some just didn't care.

8,33. Kyoto,Wan Chai,Japanese,3.8,58.5,0.0,"With so many burger places in Hong Kong, 33.Kyoto that does something different. They have created a different sort of rice burger. Mentioned in many local publications, I was interested. As it was pretty close to where I live, I came here for lunch with boyfriend.Located in Wanchai in an area with a number of inexpensive restaurants.Menu is in English, Japanese and Chinese. They offer an upgrade to a set which includes a salad (either potato or sesame crab salad) and miso soup. Upgrade to a soft drink for $5 or special drink for $15. They also offer sides. The burgers are basically a rice patty wrapped in nori with different types of filling. You pay and order at the cashier before sitting own and they will bring the food to you. There is no 10% service charge.0As it's still newly opened, they are offering some burgers with a drink for $33. Or the signature lobster burger for 33% off.0As there was a discount, I ordered the lobster and upgraded to a set and a soft drink ($128 +$5 for the drink but with discount came out to $90). The rice patties are grilled so they are a bit chewy. There is a lobster tail that is not overcooked and so very moist yet firm. It's topped with a slice of grilled processed cheese but it oddly wasn't gooey. Just slightly toasted on top to not be melted. I think I would have preferred it to be melted. There is also some crunchy lettuce. All of this is wrapped in a crispy piece of nori.0I upgraded to a set and chose the potato salad. Definitely don't waste your money and upgrade to the set. Or at at least not order the potato salad. Greasy and oily. This is definitely not a Japanese style potato salad as I tasted no addition mayo. The all important Japanese mayo! It just tasted like greasy mashed potato. Skip this. Seriously. Save your money.0Boyfriend ordered the $33 special burger which included a soft drink which was a boiled pork rice burger with soft boiled egg. So with the grilled rice patty and nori, you get pieces of pork and soft boiled egg inside. I don't know if they were trying to mimic the Taiwanese style pork bao? Anyways ... the pork was moist and just pull apart goodness.0The egg, however, did not look like anything like the photo. The photo showed quartered eggs with the soft egg yolk. The description was soft egg yolk. What we actually got was egg white and NO egg yolk. It was also some sad slivers of egg white at that.0Overall, taste was ok. I don't know if I'd return. I might as I live close enough but I'd try something else. I'd definitely stay away from the set upgrades. I saw the special drinks as well as some people ordered it and most were left unfinished. I was fairly full but boyfriend was still starving so if you have a large appetite, portions might not be enough."", ""I stumbled upon Kyoto's soft opening and I was glad I did.  They have a wide selection of rice burgers but I'm in love with the salmon rice burger. It's  very tasty and reasonably priced. The rice burger is crispy and made to order.

The sauce was ok and it was juicy enough. The Wagyu patty was ok too, a bit dry and not particularly rich in beef but still a pass. However, the French fries, like last time, were very bad. They were obviously over deep-fried and were too oily. For some reason, they were so easy to break apart too. Really bad fries indeed. The salads were ok, with appropriate amount of dressing which was slightly to the oily side.Soup0SoupApart from the fries and salads which came along with the set, there was also a super tiny tomato soup. It was really so tiny and a bit too sour. Yet it was ok given that it was complimentary.A drink also came along with the meal. There was nothing special to talk about.There was nothing to talk about for the service. Again no reason to come back again given the quality of the food, the price, the location and especially the very bad environment this time. If you come, please be sure to ask for somewhere indoors. I would also humbly suggest that they tell the guests in advance if they have to arrange such seatings for the guests.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-5019-premium-factory/597584?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
10,5019 Premium Factory,Central,Japanese,3.8,144.8,0.0,"5019 Premium Factory has peaked my interest for some time. I see them in all the Japanese pop up fairs. The smell of their burgers from those pop up fairs was astounding. That's when I discovered they had an actual restaurant! I had to try one of their burgers!Located in Central, it's found on the same street as that popular social media wall that all the tourists like to take a photo of. The restaurant isn't very big. There are a few tables and a long bar table on one side.0During weekday lunch time, they have a lunch set menu. Menu is in English only. Sets include a drink with sides.10I was interested in their burger so ordered the 5019 Wagyu BLT burger set, choosing the 120 gram portion ($138). It came with a side of salad and fries. First off ... the portions of the sides was quite generous. Salad greens were fresh. The fries were fantastic. Crispy and well seasoned.0The burger was quite a mouthful. There tomatoes, lettuce, bacon, pickled carrots, onions and an omelette! I didn't even get to the patty yet! The patty was moist and juicy. I love the sauce! It was sweet and savory. The bun was a sweet brioche. There was so much stuff, it was hard to hold together. This was a fantastic burger.0They gave me a point card upon leaving that was pretty easy to accumulate. Rewards include a side of chicken wings! Food was great. Service was friendly. I'd come again!"", 'Located right next to the iconic Old Hong Kong building wall art along G.O.D, 5019 Premium Factory serves Wagyu Burgers at a reasonable price. The atmosphere is quite relaxing, as hits play softly during our meal. The spacious seating plan provides comfort to guests. Be aware that they charge a 10% service fee, as it caught me off guard. The staff are quite friendly. Recommend for a chill catch up with old friends!Smiley burger, bacon cheese - 120g wagyu beef patty, bacon, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickles...$ 980Smiley burger, bacon cheese - 120g wagyu beef patty, bacon, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickles...$ 980', ""We walked in and arrived around 12:30p.m. and managed to get 2 seats at the bar table. It was quite busy despite its location as it was almost full about 10-15 minutes after we were seated. Seating at the bar table was not so comfortable as the high chairs were so hard and it was a bit difficult to move around.Lunch menu0Lunch menuLunch menu0Lunch menuWe ordered two burger lunch sets. I was a bit surprised that salad and fries were both included in the set (usually you get to choose either salad/fries), but then later on found that the portion of the fries was actually quite small, yet I noticed quite some leftover in others' plates (you will know why soon).Mix berry and Spinach Green smoothies0Mix berry and Spinach Green smoothiesWe topped up our meals by $18 each to get these smoothies instead of a soft drink. The mix berry smoothie was just like juice and it was not milky at all. The Spinach Green smoothie was made up of spinach, banana, mango etc and was slightly more milky. I found them both ok as they were quite refreshing and not too fatty, although I normally preferred shakes to go with burgers to have a really evil lunch.Raclette Cheese Burger (120g Wagyu beef patty, Raclette Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Sun-dried Tomato, Pickles)...$ 2300Raclette Cheese Burger (120g Wagyu beef patty, Raclette Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Sun-dried Tomato, Pickles)...$ 230Raclette Cheese Burger (120g Wagyu beef patty, Raclette Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Sun-dried Tomato, Pickles)...$ 2300Raclette Cheese Burger (120g Wagyu beef patty, Raclette Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Sun-dried Tomato, Pickles)...$ 230Raclette Cheese Burger (120g Wagyu beef patty, Raclette Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Sun-dried Tomato, Pickles)...$ 2300Raclette Cheese Burger (120g Wagyu beef patty, Raclette Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Sun-dried Tomato, Pickles)...$ 230We asked for double Wagyu patty at a cost of $50 for this burger as well.The waiter poured the melting Raclette cheese onto our burger when it was served to us and it caught the attention of other customers sitting nearby. The Raclette cheese was really the highlight of the burger. It tasted quite salty but it was so good! It was so thick despite having melted. However, the patty was too salty and broke into minces so easily. The bun was toasted well and it was so crispy. Overall, we were a bit disappointed by the Wagyu patty.The accompanying fries were quite subpar. Although freshly deep-fried, some of them seemed over-deep-fried and some of them were too thin with too much batter. So you know why there were quite some leftover by others. The accompanying salad was better with the nice sesame dressing and fresh veggies in general.Ryoma  Burger (120g Wagyu beef patty, Tomato, Egg, Bonito Flake, Eggplant, Chedder, Bell Pepper, Lettuce)...$ 1410Ryoma  Burger (120g Wagyu beef patty, Tomato, Egg, Bonito Flake, Eggplant, Chedder, Bell Pepper, Lettuce)...$ 141This burger looked smaller and tasted less outstanding than I thought from my reading of others' comments on openrice. It was much less salty than the Raclette Cheese Burger and it was more refreshing with the more variety of veggies, smooth egg omelette and smoked tuna. Overall, I gave it a rating of 4 given the creativity and uniqueness in town.Honey Toast with Vanilla ice cream$ 640Honey Toast with Vanilla ice cream$ 64I didn't feel so full after clearing our plates so I asked whether there was any dessert that we could order. I was told that itwas the only dessert so we decided to give it a try.It was to our surprise when it was served to us, as it was served on a teppan with all the exciting cooking sound! The toast was deep fried and soaked in honey. It was so crispy and sweet and it went really great with the vanilla ice cream. I was glad that it was vanilla ice cream rather than something more heavy to balance the heaviness of the deep-fried toast and chocolate sauce. Yummy and special dessert indeed.Overall food quality seemed ok despite the rather disappointing Wagyu patty. Given the cost and the location, there were definitely better burger places in the same district with better chips and shakes. In short, I don't think I would come back again after this visit."", ""Decided to give this place a try for lunch. I didn't have to wait at all as there weren't anyone else eating at the restaurant when I got there at noon. I ordered the Cheese Burger lunch set, which was $97 including the 10% service charge. The lunch set included the burger, salad (great dressing), fries and a drink. I was pretty satisfied with the burger - it was juicy with a good amount of melted cheese.The price is standard for Central, but quite pricy for a burger meal. The meat quality was good though so I'm not complaining! Staff were friendly as well.

11,616,Causeway Bay,Chinese,3.7,50.0,0.0,"616 is a hot pot place that focuses on beef. You can basically throw any part of the beef (you name it, they'll probably have it) into their boiling pot of hot soup. Their name is also a play on the Cantonese phrase that people use during hot pot. To give it a quick boil.But what does a hot pot place serve during lunch? Most do close and only open at night. But with steep rent, most opt to stay open. Some offer hot pot and then some, like this place, offer lunch sets that are not related to hotpot at all.Located on a street where there are already a number of other hot pot places is this 616. It's designed in a retro style. There is even a drawing of a wet market. I guess to show they get fresh ingredients for you to boil away.0Boyfriend and I came here for lunch where we were presented with a lunch menu. Menu is in Chinese and partly English. Only the drinks has no English. But you can add $7 and get a drink (soft drink or soy milk). There is no 10% service charge and prices under $50. As their shop is all beef hotpot, their lunch menu consisted of all beef (except for one vegetarian option).0I ordered a soy milk and it was prepackaged in a plastic cup. It was ok. Not much soybean flavor.0They also gave us a bowl of daily Chinese soup. It was savory and it appeared to be beef with random vegetables. Not too bad.0Marinated Beef (Char Siu Style) Fried Rice ($48). I ordered this. Pretty decent. The rice wasn't oily at all. The little cubes of beef were made to resemble char siu and did have that same texture. They had marinated it in spices that included Szechuan peppercorns to give it a slight numbing effect but it wasn't too much. Just enough to let you know it was there.0Slow Cooked Beef Brisket /Short Ribs with Rice ($48). Boyfriend ordered this and it seemed majority of the peope who ate here also ordered this. It came in a pot with some rice on the side.0The pot included beef brisket.0A lot of short ribs. There seemed to be more short ribs to beef brisket.0And there were some vegetables such as daikon.0The broth was rich with the various spices used. The beef brisket and short ribs were soft and tender. No wonder this was the popular item. For $48, a pretty good deal.Inexpensive lunch sets. The only downside is you must be a beef fan. If you don't eat beef, then this place is not for you. Bu if you love beef, some pretty good inexpensive options to choose from. May return and try the hot pot.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-616%E5%8D%81%E4%BA%8C%E5%91%B3/532687?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
12,8 Otto e Mezzo BOMBANA,Central,Italian,3.8,761.3,0.0,"It was our second visit. Our first visit about a few years ago hadn't given us a very impressive impression but we had just ordered a few items from their a la carte menu so we thought maybe it was a time for a re-visit and for trying their set lunch menu.A window-side table had been reserved quite a while ago during weekday lunch.Lunch Menu1Lunch MenuLunch Menu0Lunch MenuLunch Menu0Lunch MenuLunch Menu0Lunch MenuIt seemed that after a few years their a la carte menu looked pretty much the same. I still remembered that we had tried Marinated Tuna Tartare which was quite good while their Baby Lamb from Aveyron and Short Rib & Beef Tenderloin were nothing outstanding especially the former.Set Lunch Menu1Set Lunch MenuThere were two lunch sets: 4 courses including appetizer, pasta, main and dessert or cheese at $1080+10% and 3 courses with either pasta or main at your choice and everything else the same at $780+10%. As we were not so hungry, we decided to go for the 3-course lunch set.Bread basket with olive oil & vinegar0Bread basket with olive oil & vinegarVery soon, a bread basket was served to us with olive oil & vinegar already waiting on our desk. There was no introduction of the bread.The bread was served warm with very crispy and thin crust and pretty soft and airy interior. They went great with vinegar which was sour and slightly sweet. I didn't like the olive oil which was kindly served to me by a server pouring it onto a small plate near the plate for the bread. Quite a waste because most was untouched.The cheese stick and the thin crisp were both very crispy, with the former being very rich in cheese flavour.Amuse Bouche0Amuse BoucheThe Amuse Bouche seemed to contain 3 starch balls with cheese and beetroot. The server did introduce to us that there were cheese and beetroot but we couldn't recall what the balls were made of. Taste- and texture-wise they seemed to be made from starch and they were totally TASTELESS! They were nothing comparable with Japanese chewy rice balls. The cheese flavour was very very weak and even the beetroot sauce was the same. The only good thing about the dish was probably the look. Quite disappointing indeed.Rye bread with olive oil & vinegar0Rye bread with olive oil & vinegarThe second bread basket was Rye bread. Again the bread was served warm and the crust was very thin and crispy while the interior was very soft and airy. Again it went great with the vinegar. You would soon know why we need to eat so much bread because the portion of the dishes was really quite small, except for the pasta.RRoasted Octopus with Roasted Artichoke, Aromatic Herbs Dressing...0RRoasted Octopus with Roasted Artichoke, Aromatic Herbs Dressing...Roasted Octopus with Roasted Artichoke, Aromatic Herbs DressingWe ordered both appetisers on the set lunch menu to share. The roasted octopus was ok in terms of texture which was not particularly chewy or tender but it didn't taste particularly fresh. The artichoke was very salty and a bit too rough. The dressing had nothing special. Overall, it was quite disappointing.Scallops in Bread Crust, Sweet Peas Emulsion, Black Truffle...1Scallops in Bread Crust, Sweet Peas Emulsion, Black Truffle...Scallops in Bread Crust, Sweet Peas Emulsion, Black TruffleThis appetiser was much better as the scallops were cooked quite well, with crusty crust made with bread and not fully cooked interior of the scallops. The sweet peas emulsion was ok, not particularly outstanding while the black truffle didn't smell or taste particularly nice either. It could have been even better in my humble opinion.The server had asked if we would like our main and pasta to be served together. It was really appreciated.Scampi Trenette with Datterino Tomato, Basil, Scampi Jus...1Scampi Trenette with Datterino Tomato, Basil, Scampi Jus...Scampi Trenette with Datterino Tomato, Basil, Scampi JusWe chose this over the other one because we didn't like vegetarian pasta much. The Trenette was really al dente, I would say it was of the perfect texture. The Scampi Jus was sufficiently rich and every piece of Trenette was well-flavoured by the Jus. For some reason I found it very slightly spicy which was quite good and appetising. The small Scampi pieces were fresh and crispy too. A very good pasta indeed but definitely not something you couldn't find elsewhere so I had discounted the rating a bit to give it 4 given the fame.Roasted Kinki Fish with Fennel and Tarragon Sauce0Roasted Kinki Fish with Fennel and Tarragon SauceRoasted Kinki Fish with Fennel and Tarragon SauceThe fish had crispy skin but except that there was really nothing special. The sauce was ok but nothing outstanding. The portion was extremely small. The fish was much smaller than my palm.Please note that there was no removal of the bread crusts from our table before the serving of our desserts.Warm Apple Puff with Vanilla Gelato, Caramel Apple Jam...0Warm Apple Puff with Vanilla Gelato, Caramel Apple Jam...Warm Apple Puff with Vanilla Gelato, Caramel Apple Jam...0Warm Apple Puff with Vanilla Gelato, Caramel Apple Jam...Warm Apple Puff with Vanilla Gelato, Caramel Apple JamThe apple puff was slightly warm with a slightly crispy crust. As it was just warm but not really warm enough, there was no particular pleasure to eat it together with the cold vanilla gelato, which was melting as you could tell.Almond Soup with Panna Cotta, Almond and Orange Blossom Gelato...0Almond Soup with Panna Cotta, Almond and Orange Blossom Gelato...Almond Soup with Panna Cotta, Almond and Orange Blossom GelatoThe almond soup was very outstanding though. First of all, it was really special, somewhat like Chinese sweet soup. It was sweet, maybe a bit too sweet to too many people but I liked it, and cold with strong aroma of almond. There were some nuts added to enhance the texture of the sweet soup. You could also break the thin sugar coating on top to add further crispy texture. The gelato wasn't particularly rich in orange blossom though. The best dish of the meal, overall.There was no Petit fours or coffee/tea included in the lunch set.Interior decoration was not particularly outstanding with pretty low ceilings. It was quite full on a weekday for lunch and there was not much privacy although it was quiet enough for a nice chat. Not really a place for special event I would say. The view of the window seats was nothing spectacular just overlooking Mandarin Oriental Hotel and office buildings. Service was ok but it could have been better, e.g. my cup of water was often empty.One point to note was that we did happen to see Chef Umberto Bombana running around throughout our meal.As a 3 Michelin star restaurant, I must say this dining experience was pretty disappointing. At this price, there were definitely better choices at the same district at a similar price with better environment and privacy and even food!

A late lunch just between the three of us was what I had in mind. I was trying hard to decide between Uncle Robuchon and chef Bombana but once I heard about L'Atelier de Jol Robuchon's children policy, it was pretty clear that 8 1/2 Otto e Mezzo Bombana would be the one we would be visiting this afternoon.0The good thing about chef Bombana's festive menu is that everything from starter to dessert is a simple choice between two selections. I think I can handle that.0Lunch started off brightly with the first starter of the afternoon, crispy langoustine. This tasted a little like our famous Chinese dish, salted egg yolk prawn () with the sweet little langoustine tightly coated with something like salty egg yolk on the outside. The citrus anchovy dressing was a very impressive addition to the mix and the small winter vegetable salad did well to balance the richness of the langoustine. Very nice start.Crispy langoustine, winter salad0Crispy langoustine, winter saladThe second starter turned out to be even better than my crispy langoustine. This beautifully decorated dish featuring Belon oyster and golden Beluga caviar was wonderfully complemented by a bit of Hokkaido crab meat and the seasoning with citrus and tarragon was ingenious.Belon oyster, golden Beluga caviar, Hokkaido crab meat, citrus and tarragon...0Belon oyster, golden Beluga caviar, Hokkaido crab meat, citrus and tarragon...For our pasta dish, we both went with their homemade maccheroni with blue lobster ragout and sea urchin.

Ever since its initial opening- this restaurant is still packed daily, to the rim. With a waiting list of 2-3 months (still)! If your lucky, there might be last minute reservations and you can score an exclusive seat inside. The restaurant is still littered with more Michelin Stars in the shortest amount of time! The third Michelin star finally arrived in December 2011- ""the Restaurant became the first and only Three Michelin Stars Italian restaurant outside Italy"". That is a some feat! One of the most decorated restaurant in the city! They even opened up a branch in Shanghai in 2012. A small bar lounge resides in the front, as you walk inside the lobby/lounge area- you arrive into a spacious, luxurious, bright, cosy, classic and comfortable dining room area. (There\'s also private dining rooms). I\'ve been here twice before but finally dined there for lunch, and finally got the chance to photograph and blog about it!!  Lucky me.Bread Basket0Bread BasketWe start with a nice fresh bread display! I had some of the crisp bread and bread sticks!

(that definitely is not italian warmth.) or was it the contemporary, oversized yet stone-cold interior & decor that alienate the italian culture?not only that, but but i did not sense, see or taste abundance of creativity nor wow factor in what we ate. as they say so often, the body beauty is there but w/o adorable soul!yes, the roast duck foie gras was tasty, the crab caviar salad was unusual yet plain, the king prawn chitarra was awesome in size, the veal agnolotti w/ black truffle was fantastic... everything is a foodie\'s delight, except i saw little difference or distinction from a high end ""contemporary"" or ""california"" or ""fusion"" cuisine elsewhere in any major global city.if u have eaten at L\'Atelier de Joel Robuchon, u know what i mean & u should be able to tell the difference too! so far in this hk match, french 1, italian 0!Supplementary Informationi gave a happy face only because it is laughable, not a happy meal! , !', 'This was our second visit to the 3-starred 8 1/2 Otto e Mezzo Bombana. The first thing we noticed upon our arrival was the fact that the staff looked much younger and less experienced than before. Perhaps the expansion to Shanghai has taken a chunk of experience away from the core here.Lunch was the usual 2-course or 3-course selection unless we want to go splurge with the a la carte menu. That had stayed pretty much the same since its debut.0 Confit of ""Taiyouren"" organic egg (Grade: 3/5)After a basket of bread, here came our appetizers first with a confit of ""Taiyouren"" organic egg. The onsen egg was met with a nice roman cauliflower emulsion and roasted herb bread to form a surprisingly rich combination of flavors.0 Octopus and lobster (Grade: 2.5/5)Another starter was a dish of sauted octopus and lobster. It had a bit of Mediterranean twist to it after the addition of an acquerello rice salad (which tasted very much like cous cous).I thought this was an average dish. The previous organic egg starter faired slightly better. 0After finishing up our appetizers, we sat back to relax while waiting for our main courses to arrive. But that seemed to be taking forever.More than half an hour has passed us by and we began to lose a bit of our patience. But we wanted to be polite so instead of calling our server over, we started playing around with our smartphones trying to get the waiting staff\'s attention. That did not work at all so eventually we called someone over. Lamb medallion (Grade: 3/5)Finally our main courses did arrive. The lamb medallion served on braised salsify with mushroom and natural jus was tender enough but the combination with the sauce and sidedish did not make much headway.0Going back to the service for a moment, this was the worst pacing I have ever seen from any 3-star Michelin restaurant. And that was puzzling considering that we only had a 2-course lunch set, not a complicated 12-course degustation menu. Snapper with baby spinach (Grade: 2/5)At the first glance, I thought I was going to have fried egg white as my main course. However, when I looked a bit closer, it was actually a thin slice of snapper fish sitting on a bed of baby spinach and served with an orange, oregano and extra virgin olive oil dressing.Yes I remembered now - I did order snapper. In all honesty, I was a bit shocked with how thin they made the snapper and the taste just wasn\'t particularly attractive.0After our main courses, we decided that we were not going to wait another 30 minutes for our dessert so we went for the bill instead.', 'Set lunch: Ham with Autumn SaladPumpkin Ravioli($330)Honey Vanilla Cheese Cake.(+$60)Excellent.The theme of my fantastic lunch is ""balance"".  All three courses featured interesting flavors or textures which by themselves threaten to overpower you, but are swiftly brought back in line by the other components of the dish.I wasn\'t planning on writing a review, so there is only a photo of the dessert.Ham with Autumn SaladThe ham is some Spanish ham, not Iberico.  Slightly damp and by itself, salty.The salad contains a profusion of ingredients which I assume are seasonal, including quite a few fungi/mushrooms, leaves, nuts, and other shavings that I didn\'t quite recognize.  By themselves, a hopeless jumble that is soggy and crunchy.But when you take the ham with the salad, you find that the meat provides a solid foundation.  Leaves are no longer bitter, fungi is no longer overpowering, the nuts are not as noticeable, and the ham is no longer just salty.  I wish I could explain further but it just ...works.Pumpkin RavioliWhen I saw the subheading for this item in the set menu I was worried.  ""Butter and Parmesan"".  Wouldn\'t that make a super heavy pasta?  Pumpkin is not known to be a light vegetable.  The way the chef prepared the pumpkin was to beat it almost into a cream.  I didn\'t notice the parmesan, but the butter made the pumpkin very smooth and yes, heavy.  But when I started to find the pasta weighing down my tongue, some surprise herb (mint? not quite) emerged from the dish and uplifted the texture.  It was gone in an instant, but it achieves the effect of making the ravioli creamy but not heavy.The portion is good.Honey Vanilla Cheese Cake with berry compote and mandarin sorbetAnother dazzler.  The sorbet and berry compote were very sour.  The cheese cake was solid and mildly sweet.  If you are the type of person who eats their dessert part by part, this is a failure.  But if you take the parts together, wow.  There is that balance again - the cheese cake is the bass supporting the soprano berries and alto sorbet.  Excellent value at $60 extra.DownsidesThere are, of course, negative aspects to be found in every restaurant.  In Hong Kong, quite often the training of the staff is lacking.  Otto e Mezzo is not an exception.While the staff are reasonably diligent in delivering courses, taking away dishes, and pointing you to the bathroom, they are not very attentive to other duties.  Refilling water, for example.  Also, simply because the wine glasses are large, does not mean you should pour a ton of wine into the glass.  You should only pour up to the widest level of the glass at the very maximum.  It is interesting how so many waiters fail this test.  The staff should also look out for customers raising their hands to call for whatever.ConclusionCompared to the standard of the food though, my misgivings at the service are really quite minor.  Do give this new restaurant a go.  I might even return in the near future to try their degustation.Honey Vanilla Cheese Cake0Honey Vanilla Cheese Cake'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-8-otto-e-mezzo-bombana/41122?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw
13,85 South,Central,American,4.5,125.0,0.0,"One hot Saturday afternoon, we decided to check out 85 South after seeing an ad for it in a magazine. One person in my party had tried it via catering before, so we were all interested in checking it out. The sun drenched, up-hill trek from the mtr to the restaurant left us all a little tired, but inside the air-con was blasting and there was only one other customer inside. We were able to sit immediately.Decor:The decor is ok - very sparse. Concrete floors and walls, with some murals on the walls. There\'s some large wooden tables and benches to sit on, as well as a small bar area. Each table has a roll of paper towels and a bucket with ketchup and three different types of BBQ sauces. It really reminded me many places I have been to in the US. I only am rating it a three, because to me it seems like there is a lot of untapped potential as the current decorations are very bland and interesting.Taste:The BBQ is cooked in the style of North Carolina. Slow cooked, tender, and full of flavour. There were three different types of sauces available: a more ""typical"" BBQ sauce (the table favourite), a vinegar-BBQ sauce, and a honey mustard BBQ sauce. We all ordered the pulled pork and the ribs - all extremely tender and flavourful. I highly recommend the pulled pork. The meals also came with coleslaw and thick french fries. The coleslaw has a more sweet, vinegar like taste and I would say it was just ok, but dislike coleslaw in general. Everything else was extremely delicious and left everyone feeling full and happy.Service:The menu was posted on a blackboard at the counter where you order. After we ordered, they brought us our food. One of the workers, who I think was the manager, was extremely friendly. However when we were ordering, there was some confusion with the cashier about substituting a part of our order. We wanted to substitute the coleslaw for some baked-beans, but the cashier finally said we could only substitute the french fries for baked beans. We were confused about we could order, the cashier did help to explain it to us clearly and was unwilling to provide some basic customer service. That was a disappointment, because I was told the baked beans were delicious and I really wanted to try them but the full price for a side was too expensive for one person. Value for money:I feel the price for the meal was fair, but the price for the sides and drinks was too much. The drinks costs $20 for just a can (!!!) and $50 for a side order. They were extremely rigid about what sides we could substitute in a meal, which would cost an extra $20. For one person, $50 is just too much to get a side, especially if you\'re already ordering a meal. There should be more options about which items in the meal you can substitute. And perhaps some small and large side order options for different prices.I highly recommend this restaurant if you want some delicious BBQ.', 'The restaurantMy wife and I arrived relatively early at 12:00 on a Sunday (German style), so we could immediately get a table since they just opened. The mouthwatering aroma of their food was not annoying as standing in the middle of the kitchen, but just enough to create a big appetite. The decoration is nice with contemporary graffitti on their walls. Don\'t forget to leave your tag/mark on the restroom walls -pen is provided by the restaurant!Service was nice and chatty not only to us, but to other patrons joining the restaurant later - yet leaving enough room to enjoy the food. Not sure whether it\'s normal, but since my wife is on a special low-carb diet, he was flexible enough to swap fries against more cole-slaw. Just a minor favour, but still leaving a positive impression.Juicy pulled pork and tender ribs!We started off with their delicious house-made lemonade, which was just right. Many others add too much sugar and others add too much acidity or bitterness. I liked it, because it was really well-balanced in sweetness and tartness. The owner explained to us that they will introduce some spiked drinks later.Our original plan was to order a portion of pulled pork and then a portion of their ribs, which were only available at 13:00 since they smoke those fresh over hours to get them really tender. That pulled pork was amazingly juicy and tasty! We\'ve been tasting pulled pork around the world, including ""Fette Sau"" in Brooklyn (featured in NY Times, etc.), which is famous for their pulled pork and where many dozen people queue up just to get seats. 85 South\'s pulled pork is right up there or even better in juicyness and taste.The pulled pork can be accompanied by three different sauces, each with their very own delicious taste direction and compliment the pulled pork very nicely. Since there is a full bottle of each sauce on every table, there\'s definitely no need to ration - go full in if you want! The cole-slaw is not based on mayonnaise, but as ha very tasty tomato-base, which feels much lighter and has ha nice tanginess.We loved it so much, that I somehow messed up our nice plan and went for another portion of pulled pork, but this time with fries for me. Theyhave steak fries and while I\'m rather a fan of thin fries, they use a special Southern Californian seasoning, which give those fries an extra kick. Some might say it\'s too salty, but for me it was just right.Already quite full, I had to convince my wife to taste the ribs. She didn\'t want to taste even one single piece because she was so full off the pulled pork already. But when the ris arrived and after she tasted only one single bite, she was literally hooked! I was already quite stuffed as well, but couldn\'tstop eating more of those delicious ribs. They don\'t come out glazed with any sauce, but come instead with a very nice and unique spice rub. And that\'s perfectly fine, as you can still add any of the three sauces if you like. But we just enjoyed the ribs as they were.Totally stuffed after those three portions and deperately wanting a digstion nap, we were already thinking when we could come back to have more. But next time, we will stick to one portion per person - at least that\'s once again only the plan...Supplementary InformationThe HKD 150 per head were because we had 3 dishes, which made us very full. One dish per person is probably enough for most, so HKD 100 per head does not seem unrealistic.'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-85-south/152879?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

One of Tokyo's top 10 most popular souffle pancake destinations arrived in Hong Kong with a lot of fanfare. For some reason, girls just love souffle pancakes and they will queue up for hours! And A Happy Pancake always had a long long line! I know a friend who lined up for an hour before his girlfriend arrived and together they waited a half hour more before they could dine in. I didn't have the patience to line up so I pretty much forgot about it. Until one day, I walked by on my way to lunch in this building and saw ... no one was in line! There was no queue! There was plenty of seats!Well, pasta at this other place had to wait. A Happy Pancake I go! The seating is not cramped and the kitchen is in the back where you can see them cooking.0Menu is in Chinese and an English menu is available upon request which I will show here. There is no 10% service charge. You pay at the cashier on your way out. Just like in Japan! Water is available at one counter where you pour yourself. You can choose regular water or fruit water (which is just some lemon slices in water).They have sweet pancakes.0And savory ones as well if you don't want it sweet. Add a bit of money for a drink.00They also have a seasonal special as well.0A little note is placed at each table telling you not only the wifi password but to not complain that you are waiting forever for you food. It takes at least 20 minutes. This is really correct! My food arrived 20 minutes after I ordered.0As I was waiting, I added $18 for an orange juice. This was ok. Freshly squeezed and lots of pulp.0But this was what I was waiting for. I chose the Happy Pancake ($108) as the other combinations didn't entice me. I added $15 for a scoop of vanilla ice cream. It was a plain souffle pancake with a scoop of Manuka honey whipped butter on top and sprinkled with powdered sugar. There was a small pitcher of caramel sauce. The caramel sauce I felt was a bit on the bitter side. But the pancake! Soft fluffy. And not tasting like egg whites and sugar like so many places in Hong Kong that does this. It still had the texture of pancakes but still soft and fluffy from the egg whites. It was exactly as how I had them in Japan. The honey whipped butter was wonderful. Not too sweet but just perfect.0The pancakes were heavenly. Service was very good. Great if you don't have to line up. If I had to line up ... I'm unsure if I'd be back. Apparently, I learned that during lunch hour, there is rarely a line."", 'Pancakes have been very popular for almost a year in the territory. Among all the dessert houses in Hong Kong, I think A Happy Pancake is one of the best eateries for fluffy pancakes. Indeed, I had visited A Happy Pancake in Osaka last year. Even in Japan, there were long queues outside the branches. So I have been very excited once I know that they are going to open one in Hong Kong, and I do not mind queuing if the pancakes taste as fluffy as they were in Osaka. This time, we lined up for 40 minutes.Happy Pancake$ 1081Happy Pancake$ 108The first pancake we had was Happy Pancake, the basic one. I was totally impressed when I first tried it in Osaka as the pancakes were super fluffy! Luckily, the pancakes in Hong Kong were as fluffy as they were in Japan. The 40-min-wait was definitely worth the time! The whipped butter which was made of butter and Manuka honey added a slight sweetness to the pancakes. For every bite, the whipped butter, cream and pancake melted in our month, and the scent of flour and egg was very strong! That was a great satisfaction!Pancake with Seasonal Fruits$ 1381Pancake with Seasonal Fruits$ 138Another sweet pancake was Pancake with Seasonal Fruits. This one looked more photogenic as it was more colourful! Yet, we were slightly disappointed as some of the fruits were a bit sour. Fortunately, the pancake itself tasted great!Pancake with Mushroom Cheese Omelet$ 1181Pancake with Mushroom Cheese Omelet$ 118We moreover tried a savoury dish, which is called meal pancake. The one we ordered was Pancake with Mushroom Cheese Omelet. The pancake was less fluffy than the sweet one, but it tasted interesting as you could the wheat inside the pancake. We were surprised by the omelet as it tasted very smooth and was nicely seasoned.In short, this dessert house is worth visiting. Also, it is definitely an ideal place for girls gathering as most, if not all, girls have a sweet tooth.', ""Always heard from my friend that A HAPPY PANCAKE is very well-known in Japan, therefore its definitely a must to try it once in Hong Kong! This morning, my friend and I arrived the restaurant by the time it opened (around 10am). To our biggest surprise, there was no queue at all! Cant believe the hot wave has passed sooo quickly, because previously my friends said it usually takes a 2-hour wait. Overall speaking, pancake tastes pretty good as they are as fluffy as expected. The egg flavor is quite strong though, which may not be quite pleasant to some people. Portion is alright as I was extremely full after eating. For plain pancake, it came with caramel sauce and a scoop of cream with honey flavor. A little bit tooo sweet but still acceptable. For chocolate banana pancake, chocolate sauce is rich but not tooo heavy and it matches with the pancake pretty well. For drinks, we had royal milk tea which has a pretty decent latte art. Not overloaded with sugar. However, it tastes tooo milky which almost covered the tea flavour. Anyway, since the signature dish of this restaurant is pancake sooo it doesn't really matter even if the drinks are not appealing to me. Besides the outstanding food, its design as an open kitchen allows us to take a glimpse of how people inside made this pancake. This makes the entire dining experience even more pleasant and enjoyable.Chocolate bananapancake$ 1231Chocolate bananapancake$ 123Happy pancake$ 1080Happy pancake$ 108Royal milk tea$ 280Royal milk tea$ 280""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-a-happy-pancake/576312?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

The sweet japanese prawn is slightly undercooked similar to the sashimi you find in Japanese places, but retains its sweetness. This was surrounded by a chilled, very light tomato soup and pitted cherries. A great palate cleanser. Portion is on the small side.Main course: Tagliolini with Quail RagoutI love places that offer fresh made egg pasta and this was definitely very fresh, with loads of egg flavor, almost angel hair-like thickness coated in a creamy sauce, with bits of quail and gelatine quail fat  Portion again is small-ish.

The udon noodles were fine, nothing spectacular. The tempura was freshly made and hot which was good. Batter was not the thinest or even very thin (but then cannot expect Tokyo top-class quality here). Not the thick and plasticky variety either. So I would say it is fine especially for a quick lunch of 30 minutes. What was strange was that it came with two sushi rolls which had no topping or filling. Wonder why?The tempura on rice was pretty good too. Again, tempura freshly made and I feel that the rice was better value, with 5 prawns (cost just a bit more than the udon) and it made for a filling meal.Both came with the usual yellow radish slices which was pretty standard.

Prawn head was not processed and cooked with much flavour yet simple butter soy with rice vinegar. Lobster was cooked with garlic butter, garlic was over cooked and turned bitter. Next dish was Sashimi but not served until Beef was already served, should be served earlier.Lobster head was added back to miso soup but did not enhance the flavour of soup at allBeef steak: I asked for medium and I got a perfect medium, which is greatDipping sauce taste flavourless Since the Chef has to cook for 8 people at the same time, she never had the chance to explain what was being servedFried rice is very dry, mixed with partially cooked rice, almost choked when eating with chopsticks.  OMG, I was not eating rice, I was swallowing hard rice, can not believe this, chef should try the moisturise the rice before seasoning. Butter Soy cooked Cabbage as finishing, bitter end.  Cabbage was too dry because cooked took long and juice are all steamed out.Chef does not clean the cooking station immediately after cooking.', 'Sometimes finding a place to eat in Wanchai could get pretty annoying, especially when it\'s just past 1pm and you don\'t have advance booking. We stumbled upon a number of places without success this afternoon before finally deciding to try our luck at QRE Plaza.After checking out a few places in the building, we zeroed in on Akita Teppanyaki and Sashimi Specialist () on the 10th floor which happened to be the only restaurant with tables available. As the name suggests, it\'s a Japanese restaurant specializing in teppanyaki and sashimi.Between teppanyaki and sashimi, it was an easy choice for me coz I have been longing for some grilled beef for a while already. In order not to waste any more time, I picked one of the sets which started with this egg custard with salmon roes in an egg shell.1My main dish was thin sliced wagyu beef rolls with garlic chips and green onions along with a piece of grilled king prawn. I thought the king prawn was real nice; the beef rolls were okay but not particularly appealing to my palate.0That was followed by the signature ""Akita"" fried rice. A small plate of stir-fried assorted vegetables was served on the side with the rice.0We had to pick between dessert or coffee. Personally, I\'m not a fan of having coffee at a Japanese restaurant so the fact that they only had ice-cream to offer (for dessert) didn\'t affect my decision to take ice-cream over coffee (or tea).1$158 was a fair price for a teppanyaki lunch in Wanchai these days. I seriously thought some of these dishes were a bit undersized but I guess it\'s a blessing in disguise considering I have an important meeting in the afternoon. This will make sure I don\'t fall asleep over the course of the meeting.', ""delectable food. fresh sashimi. Its a high quality restaurant with good food even though the service can be improved.Quite expensive for a meal, but it's fair for this kind of cuisine.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/wan-chai-akita-teppanyaki-sashimi/47258?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
21,Al Dente Past Grill & Seafood,Wan Chai,Italian,3.1,100.0,,"I was at the other Al Dente on Jaffe Road yesterday, but this being a lunch with colleagues I thought it would be a good place to bring them as the weather was excellent and we could sit outside.This place is really very busy; the wait staff ran round like some kind of relay race all the time until after 1:45 pm when fewer diners came in. The inside had a nice ambience and had comfy sofa seats; I can imagine a lot of couples coming here for a quiet intimate date in the evening. Options for the set lunch were pretty much the same as the Jaffe Road branch: pasta, fish, steak, but instead of pizza they have chicken. As I've never had pasta at Al Dente before, I decided to give it a go since they must know how to cook the stuff in the style of their name sake, and I like my pasta al dente anyway and have been accused of dishing out penne that is resistance training for the jaws lolMy lunch companions decided to try all of the four mains on offer, and I opted for the penne with chicken. The salads were almost the same as the Jaffe Road branch except that instead of smoked salmon there were one or two pieces of shaved parmesan. The balsamic dressing with almost no hint of oliver oil was also consistent with Jaffe Road's. My pasta was indeed cooked al dente, but the quality of the pasta I found was a bit inferior. It was not a satisfying soild durum wheat taste, but felt like slouchy pieces of hollow matchstick men. Don't ask me why this strange description, but they didn't even stay on the fork when I stabbed them (and gently too!) The dish came with strips of dry chicken meat. It didn't taste bad, but it just didn't sate my comfort food craving.Dessert was consistent with the other branch too, warm chocolate cake and vanilla ice cream. Even though there is al fresco dining at this branch, I somehow think that I would stick with the crampy little hole-in-the-wall on Jaffe Road instead. At least my colleagues seem satisfied, so no complaints there hehe."", ""Oh...I finished the lunch with my colleague during lunch hour la, the food is generally ok la, the salad's quality was not good with some yellow leaves, and quantity are just ok gum la...no surprise. The attitudes of the waiter and waitress are really bad, not profession, no smile and not polite anyway, as a new face in this restaurant I won't return and never recommend to friends.

22,Al Dente,Central,Italian,4.2,115.0,0.0,"Exam is finally over, and it's time to catch up with friends (and to write Openrice!). There were 9 of us, and we made a reservation at 11:30am. Strangely the restaurant called us at 11:15am saying that they would open earliest at 11:45am. Hence those arrived on time had to wait outside the restaurant in this hot and humid weather :/ Set lunch menu3Set lunch menuThe $108 set lunch included:1. Soup or Salad,2. Main dish, and3. Dessert or drink FoodBread Bread0Bread This bread was unexpectedly awesome. It had a nice herbal flavour with delicately sliced onions. It was very soft yet dense-  so soft, weighty and dense that it readily broke into cubes when I dipped it into olive oil and vinegar. After clearing the loaf of bread, I noticed, sadly, that the paper underneath the loaf had been immersed in oil  Soup of the day- Pumpkin soup  Pumpkin Soup0Pumpkin SoupThis soup was nice. It was not powdery. Pumpkin was finely ground, giving a natural bright orange colour and a thick texture to the soup. I liked the small cubes of soaked crunchy garlic bread.Gammon Ham Salad Gammon Ham Salad0Gammon Ham SaladThe thin slice of ham was good. There were a variety of greens in the salad, including my favourite rocket. The dressing was a bit sour and quite refreshing; yet I could not really taste the honey dressing. The peaches had been soaked in syrup and tasted like those canned peaches. I quite liked the roasted grapes which were juicy. Pasta of the day: Spaghetti with Calamary in garlic sauce Spaghetti with Calamary0Spaghetti with CalamaryThe name of this restaurant suggested a guaranteed quality of its pasta. The texture of the spaghetti was fine- lightly tough and firm. There were satisfactory amount of calamaries which were chewy. I liked the garlicky sause. The distinctive taste was not too garlic, and was rightly balanced by the fresh and juicy tomato cubes. Well, garlicky spaghetti could seldom go wrong. This spaghetti was quite decent, but not particularly impressive. Grilled sirloin steak with mushroom sauce   Grilled sirloin steak0Grilled sirloin steakGrilled sirloin steak0Grilled sirloin steakThe steak had a beautifully charred checked pattern with an inviting grilled smell. I asked for medium; yet it was more reddish than I expected. Meaty, succulent, tender and smoky- Pretty good  The sides added marks to the dish. The mashed potato was smooth and was lightly seasoned. The slide of pumpkin was naturally sweet. Dessert of the day: Chocolate fudge cake with vanilla icecream Chocolate fudge cake with vanilla icecream0Chocolate fudge cake with vanilla icecreamThe dessert was not as delightful as the above-mentioned dishes. Yes I confessed that I took some time in taking photo of the dessert; the vanilla ice cream was however melting too rapidly (maybe that's because of the heat of the fudge cake?). The ice cream was quite tasteless. The fudge cake was very dense, moist and sticky. The texture reminded me of... the lotus paste of a moon cake  Nonetheless it had a pretty strong sweet chocolate taste. Summary/ Next?If you are looking for a decent lunch place in Soho, this might be a choice provided that you make a reservation. The portions are relatively large; but I would be happier if the lunch set includes both dessert and drink. Will surely be back"", 'Name of restaurant: Al Dente, Soho, CentralDate/time of visit: 29/6 Wednesday 2:30pm Reason for going: Following our visit to Epoch Coffee Bar at Wanchai last time, we were keen to search for a better plate of pasta, somewhere that served traditional Italian pasta. After some thoughts, we agreed that Soho of Central had a great variety of western restaurants. Most of them were owned by westerners and the quality of food must be of a high quality to serve the higher class of residents living nearby. We therefore decided to try our luck there. The lunchtime of that day was raining dogs and cats. It was horrible. The rain was not heavy but it was the wind that made the matter worse. We could barely walk as we needed to fight with the wind. Unfortunately, we were bad navigators: we totally missed the long escalators connecting the Central MTR station and Soho. We took a longer path by climbing the steep streets instead. As a result, we were soaked by the time we arrived the restaurant after a 45 minutes walk from the MTR station.  What a great start for lunch! Inside Al Dente0Inside Al DenteAtmosphere: The restaurant was located in Staunton Street of Soho. It was quite a small restaurant comparing to other big ones nearby, yet we found the setting very homey. As the size of the shop was extremely small, the tables were closed to each other and seats were not comfortable when your shoulder is just a few inches away from the person by your side. Luckily, due to the rain, when we arrived, there were a few unoccupied tables. We were able to sit somewhere not too near to other customers. Food: We arrived at 2:30pm; we were just in time for the lunch set which lasted until 3pm. We chose Soup of the Day, Pasta of the Day and Tiramisu with ice cream.Soup of the Day0Soup of the Day0 Soup of the Day (Cream of Mushroom) The soup was served immediately after we had placed our order, probably because there were not many customers. A basket of bread was served alongside with the soup. We did not wait to taste the bread. To our surprise, the bread was soft and moist. It was warm and smelled of finely chopped fresh onion and herbs. We dipped the bread into some olive oil and black vinegar to enhance the taste  it was perfect.  We gave the bread a score of 9 out of 10. The soup had a fine taste, and the bread crumb in it had a herb flavor. However we found the soup too powdery. It was not smooth enough and did not blend with other ingredients. We preferred a thicker and creamier soup. Therefore we gave this soup a score of 6.5 out of 10.Pasta of the Day0Pasta of the Day Pasta of the Day (Linguine with Chicken and Mushroom in a White Wine Garlic Sauce) The pasta was splendid! When the pasta was served, the smell of garlic combining with white wine sauce was instantly released from the dishes and straight into our nostrils.  It was a very pleasurable virtual appetite without even trying the dish. The ingredients, chicken and mushroom, were cooked very well. The texture of the linguine was just right and we liked it. The portion of pasta was good enough for our appetite, we were not bloated when we finished. However we would recommend the dish be made less salty so that customers needed not keep drinking water. For the pasta, we gave a score of 8 out of 10. Tiramisu with ice cream0Tiramisu with ice cream Tiramisu with ice creamExpectations do not necessary get fulfilled when you have your hopes too high. This is true to our dessert. We anticipated a great ending to our meal  however, the dessert was too small comparing to our previous courses. The tiramisu was not smooth enough, not moisturized and not creamy at all. As for the ice cream, it was awful! It was the worst ice cream I ever had.  A three-star hotels tea buffet would do better than that. The vanilla ice cream was below average as it easily melted and tasted very artificial and had absolutely no vanilla taste at all. We gave this course a score of 3.5 out of 10. Service: The service was very good! The staff was nice and friendly. Most of the staff were Italians and were passionate about the quality of food and servicing. We could feel their genuine and sincere attitude. However, towards the end of our meal, we were rushed to leave as they had to fix their lights. It could have been better if we could stay longer to dry ourselves before we fought with the rain again. Overall, I think Al Dente was a good restaurant. I would like to visit it again to try out other soups and pasta of the day if I happen to pass by since there is no distinct aspect that attracts me to travel all the way from Kowloon.'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-al-dente/9951?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

It wasn't a surprise but it's not bad. If you think a soup is too much for a lunch, you may opt for salad.I chose fish fillet and my friend ordered pizza-one of the signature dishes at the shop together with pasta.The fish is a real delight. Exquisitely served, tasty and generous in portion. It comes with a sour sauce; and side dishes include mash potato, sweet potato, baked carrot, peppers and asparagus. I recommend this dish.My friend ordered pizza of the day, which was pepperoni. Not bad but the fish is better.Dessert is chocolate fudge with icecream. Freshly baked, it was still warm when served on table. Sweet and rich in chocolate.

It seems to have built a reputation for itself fast with a branch across the road (well not quite, it's across Gloucester Road in Sanlitun after all). Knowing that it would probably fill up quickly, I booked for lunch a day early. We were given a table right at the back, being in very close quarters with the table next door. Set lunch was a $88 affair with choce of mains of pasta, pizza, fish or steak. Me and my lunch companion decided on the salad, and I had the steak and he chose pizza. The salads are hearty portions with lots of fresh vegetables plus 2 or 3 slivers of smoked salmon, mixed lightly with a sweet balsamic dressing which was not heavy on the olive oil. The steak came with a nice creamy mash potato and some side veggies, the steak was better than the average set lunch jobs both in terms of size and taste, in that I could actually taste the grilled flavour a bit. My lunch companion's pizza was a decent sized thin-crust margherita which I heard was good too. It was either coffee/tea or dessert and I opted for dessert, a small wedge of warm chocolate cake and a dollop of vanilla ice cream, which did the job for me just right. Apparently after 1 pm they only offer one or the either, which seems a bit of a strange policy to me. But overall, despite the proximity with fellow diners as well as waiters whom I had to dodge a couple of times when they went past, the food was enjoyable and satisfying."", 'I decided to visit my ex-colleague in Wanchahi today.

26,Amaroni's Little Italy,Causeway Bay,Italian,1.6,200.0,0.0,"I went to Amaroni\'s in Hysan Place on Sunday 30 June 2013.It was one of the worst dining experience in years. I ordered a burger meal set for myself and a Roast Chicken Spaghetti meal for my girlfriend. On the menu, it didn\'t say what would come with the burger. The ""shredded onions"" came with it, well, were surprisingly not fries that would normally come with burgers, and were of very bad quality. Those ""shredded onions"" were super deep fried, overly crispy, and were extremely oily. I can barely ate some of it and had totally no idea what food they were until being informed that its ""shredded onions"" in super dry deep fried version.The waiter, and the manager, did a great job in not letting us know it was the onion shred that came with the meal, and in return, they offered some leftover potato wedges from the kitchen. Those potato wedges were what one could imagine, very dry, tasteless, oily, rough to chew, and had been left in the kitchen since lunchtime peak hours. I think if we even ate a quarter of those deep dried onion shreds or leftover potato wedges, we would have had oesophagus caner right the way. What was more, all of those cannot compare to other even worse experience we had come across.The burger was considerably overly well-done, so it was just like chewing a meat flavoured telephone book, and it was rather dry to be honest, companioned by just a piece of cheese on it and two ciabatte breads. I had to add in some fresh red onions, lettuce, and tomato sauce. I asked the waiter and the manager whether there were any choice on how well the meat could have been done and none of them offered any options, but stutterly informed us that it was how they did it and no other ""medium well"" or ""medium rare"" kind of normal options for a meat dish.Girlfriend\'s Roast Chicken Spaghetti was chewy, of course, and dried to the bone. One time she even commented that it was like munching ""a lump of dry unflavoured rubber with muscle fibres."" I would have to say a little of more attention to the cooking time would have helped to retain the juiciness of the chicken meat. But of course, Amaroni\'s didn\'t do that and staff said it was just totally normal in the way they cook it.Shock of the day was half an iceberg lettuce served uncut on the dish as the vegetables that went with the chicken, half of a whole iceberg lettuce served UNCUT, yes, just like it was straight out of the fridge, totally shocking. Someone could have used a knife to chop it up a little before serving to the customers I would imagine. The red onion rings that came with the burger also came with the onion skin, oh well. how considerate, and very raw indeed.There were too much to complaint on and I do not think I can write them all down, but one thing. We had kindly expressed our concerns to three different staff, including the manager, on the quality of the food and the lack of information on the menu on what were being served with the meal. Regrettably, none of the staff had provided any suggestions on how the food could be improved, nor providing any alternatives to help easing the inexcusably inattentive food services. They were not apologetic at all, but dismissive at best.Maybe it was just a Sunday afternoon which Amaroni\'s wasn\'t expecting to have customers? The neighbouring restaurant serving western food was buoyant, therefore, it was quite a contrast to the rather emptily seated and chit-chatting staff in the Amaroni\'s.There we had it, the Amaroni\'s dining experience, food quality was worst of its kinds, meat overly cooked and dry vegetables totally not chopped, potato wedges and onion ""shreds"" super deep fried, and adding to the unsurpassed indifferent attitude of Amaroni\'s staff. Bravo, Amaroni\'s, you made yourself top of the worst restaurants in the Hong Kong island. The restaurant manager was ""Derek Chui"" at the time.I would strongly not recommend my friends or anyone to visit the Amaroni\'s.', 'Went to Eslite and this newly opened shopping mall after the crazy crowded period. Nice place with various choices in the food court and new restaurants. I\'ve visited Amaroni\'s in Festival Walk several times, food quality is not bad. So I believed it should be fine this branch.

Just slightly warm in the middle, and the sides were coldDespite the temperature, the lasagna quality was not good at all. Beef was not evenly placed, more than half side didnt have beef between the layers, and all the beef placed at the other side corner; the lasagna noodle was not tasty. The only credit can be given is the tomato sauce, but cold.Service was not a good enough to compensate the food quality. When I settled the bill, the waiter just hand me the bill without saying the amount, without saying thank you....after I signed the credit card bill, he just walked away...The overall feeling did not match with their ""mission statement"" stated in the menu at all...1000Cold bread0Cold bread00'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-amaronis-little-italy/109010?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

There used to be a nice lounge at the same location. It then folded and turned into a decent Japanese restaurant, which also folded and now became Amazake, which literally means sweet sake. It's a special type of sake usually served hot during festive seasons.Amazake has a funky interior with a comical sumo wrestler appearing throughout the shop. There is a prominent bar area set in the middle of the shop with partitioned seats and regular tables arranged around the bar counter.01There is a limited but sufficient amount of lunch sets to choose from:0I ordered a katsu don while my colleagues ordered tempura set , a seafood don and a negitoro don respectively.First came the salad (due to some techinal difficulties I couldn't upload that photo.) The salad was wholesome and tasty enough for set lunch standards. The amount of sesame sauce used was certainly generous. No complaints at all. That was relatively uneventful until we get to the miso soup and chawanmushi (steamed egg):While both the miso soup and the chawanmushi were decent enough (I would have preferred more dashi, i.e. fish stock, in the steamed egg as it was quite bland), what those lacked in quality they made it up by quantity. By that, I mean the restaurant does not appear to have a record of what the customers had. Most of the servers held a large tray with either miso soup or steamed egg. As they walked past each table, they will ask whether you had the soup or egg already before putting it on your table - which was normal, or just put it on your table if they can not see either of those on your table. 00In our case, we each received either an extra egg or miso soup. Being honest customers, we alerted them to the situation. Not that I'm really complaining about it.  After a rather long wait (and two more trays of miso soup and egg), my katsu don finally arrived:0The amount of egg sauce was good, it was neither too salty nor too soggy. The taste was just fine. The Japanese pearl rice was nice too. It was just the right texture.Unfortunately, the cutlet porkchops (tonkatsu) were a bit soggy.I suspect it's probably because my katsu don had been languishing somewhere on the servers counter before being brought to my table and not the fault of the kitchen staff. The management leave a lot to be desired.All in all, the katsudon was fine but HK$190 plus service is a bit steep.  Unfortunately, one of my colleagues was not satisfied with her tempura set. According to her, the tempura prawn was fairly bland and the batter was too soggy. 0  The colleague who had negitoro thought his was fine but I think the color of the negitoro is slightly too white for my liking. In my experience, it tends to indicate that it had been kept in the freezer for a bit too long. 0On the other hand, my other colleague enjoyed his amazake assorted sashimi bowl ($240).0  I asked for the dinner menu just for the sake of completeness. The items there seems far more interesting than the lunch sets here.

There is even a drawing of Sham Shui Po on one wall.0Menu is in Chinese but English is available upon request. There is no 10% service charge. What they serve is what you can find in a typical wonton noodle shop.0They also have afternoon tea sets on weekdays.0For $8, you can add a drink or vegetables. I added gai lan. These were steamed and ok. Love that they put the oyster sauce on the side instead of on top like other places.0I ordered a bowl of wonton noodles ($36). There was a total of 5 wonton dumplings. This is one more than a lot of other places that only give you four.0The wonton skin was thin and there was a lot of shrimp in it but not a lot of pork meat. It was also too much pepper added so it only tasted peppery.0The soup was clear with a rich taste of shrimp and flounder. A very traditional soup base.0The noodles were good. Al dente. Not as dark in color as the now closed Wing Wah. It was very good.0One thing I wonder, is everything from the main shop in Sham Shui Po? Why were they using their order pad and not create their own? Why not just call this Lau Sum Kee's new branch?0That strangeness aside, the noodles were good. Portion size was larger than a lot of other good wonton noodle shops. Price not overly expensive. I'd come again. I also didn't see the pickled daikon here that day. Did they have these?""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/wan-chai-amazing-mays-noodle/603747?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
29,American Restaurant,Wan Chai,Chinese,3.3,120.0,0.0,";!, ; , !Old school Peking cuisine.Excellent lamb and chicken dishes;Reasonably priced;Not just for Americans!Recommended!This restaurant has been holding strong in Wan Chai for ages, I believe more than 20 or even 30 odd years. Like what one of my colleagues commented, this place seemed like a tourist restaurant serving tourist quality food from the outside.  But to our pleasant surprise, this isn\'t one of those places.: 0: Decor: Two levels. Reasonably spaced apart. Dated but clean just like many famous Peking restaurants. Booking is recommended.  Service: Polite and the kitchen was efficient as well. No complaints.Menu: Old school selections. Beef, Pork, Chicken, Noodles, Rice and Soup. This place serves Peking cuisine so don\'t expect to get fresh seafood like in a Cantonese style restaurant but expect more lamb and other meat dishes with strong flavours.Set lunches are available but we choose to follow other reviewers\' recommendations., ! 0, ! First, complimentary appetizers: Kimchi and Cucumbers. The cucumbers and kimchi were very crunchy. The kimchi was hot!  Great quality stuff, better than many Korean restaurants!  These were what we\'ve ordered, these were all small portions. Price ranged between HK$100 for small and up to HK$300 for large (American portions?) Grilled lamb with vinegar sauce: good portion. Almost 18 chunks. Perfectly grilled crispy skin with tender and juicy lamb meat. Noticeable lamb taste. Suggest dipping it into the sauce (seemed to be a mix of spring onions, soy sauce and vinegar .) The crispiness and the texture of the grilled lamb ""knuckle"" was far better than many German pork knuckles I\'ve tried in Hong Kong! Recommended! 0Stir fried egg white:  Also known as ""Mock Crab"", a dish invented in the Qing Dynasty when the Empress suddenly wanted to have crab meats. The chef\'s in the imperial court had to scramble to make something similar to crab meat as crab meat was not something easily available in landlocked Peking (now known as Beijing). The result was stir fried egg white with shredded white bodied fish. This is definitely one of my favorite dishes.  It\'s very easy to overcook the egg white. Many restaurants either over cook the egg white or did not add fish into the mixture, which is crucial for the taste. Those here were far better than many old school restaurants around the area. It also had shreds of fresh fish meat, dried scallops and spring onions which really enhanced the taste. I really liked this dish. Mind you, some may find it oily. But usually Peking cuisines are more oily and salty than Cantonese dishes. Recommended. 0Fried Mini Pak Choi with garlic: Having mentioned about oil in Peking cuisine, there\'s still a limit to it. I found this too oily.  The vegetables were fresh though. Better ask the restaurant to reduce the oil when you place your order.0Shan Tung Hand Shredded Chicken: A whole chicken. Succulent, very tender and flavourful. Marinated in black vinegar and soy sauce, possibly with some ""five spices"" and a slight hint of ginger too. Remember to dip it into the garlic based sauce! Recommended if you like strong flavours. , , !0, , !Yang Zhou Fried Rice: Packed with fresh ingredients : prawns, shredded pork, ham, chicken and some spring onions. Some may prefer the rice to be more dry but I\'m happy with the texture and the portion - sufficient for 6 guys to share! Worth a try. , , , , 0, , , , Kung Pao Prawns: We choose prawn ""balls"" instead of just prawns. This meant at least a 300-400% increase in size (and to a lesser extent, price  ). Big prawns fried with crunchy batter and covered in sweet and spicy sauce. Not as spicy as the ones i had at Cuisine Cuisine but the prawns at both places were just as fresh. Another hit amongst the guys.! ,0! ,Dessert: Caramelized Bananas. Very good. Nice and sweet banana chunks drenched in sugar syrup and then dipped in a basin filled with ice chunks and cold water to solidify the syrup. Excellent !!0!Suzie\'s favorite:- The bill came down to HK$140 each for 6 including service for an excellent and filling meal.- Good quality Peking cuisine;- Excellent lamb and chicken dishes;- Polite service and efficient kitchen;- Reasonable price.The rather odd name of the restaurant, ""American Restaurant"", it\'s location (Lockhart Wan Chai),,  - , !0,  - , !and the retro decor 70070somehow reminded me of the movie, ""The World of Suzie Wong""!

So why would they called it roasted chicken??We paid by credit card which was issued by a Chinese bank and the waiter mocked at us in a soft voice after we had foot the bill saying that we are just Mainlander!!Thought I am not I do not feel bad about being a Mainlander. Perhaps he should be a little bit more civilized... Perhaps they count on foreign clientele and do not give a damn about local people or Mainlanders...it is not the way to treat people much less their customers.

And since she knows her neighborhood pretty well, I was more than happy to go with her recommendation - Amore di Italian at L'hart ().L'hart has already been around for a number of years but it's one of those small buildings in Causeway Bay that I knew very little of. As a matter of fact, I've only been here a number of times, all of which were visits to Japanese restaurants Toba downstairs. Needless to say, I was quite interested to see what they have in store for us.0My starter was a small salad with parma ham, asparagus and cheese.

33,Antipasto,Central,Italian,4.3,110.0,,"This is my favorite place for lunch in so-ho. $108 for 4 courses: soup/appetizer + mains + desert + tea. Cant find any place cheaper and better nearby.Living up to its name, Antipasto serves great appetizer. The complimentary crumble bread, served with their home-made spread, is superb. By itself, the bread is already filled with herbs. If you want to have more complexity in flavor, the spread will help you do the rest. Most importantly, all the bread is HOT.The formal appetizer is of high quality as well. Calamari salad, grilled fungi, bruschetta  they are all good. And the variety is wide. Their menus will change every week.The mains is good value for monies too. I love their pasta the most, as they are al dente and hot, not to mention rich in flavor (white wine/tomato/garlic). Nowadays, its really difficult to find authentic Italian pasta in Hong Kong. Either it was too tender or too cold. Having a piping hot dish of al dente pasta for lunch certainly satisfy my craving for carbohydrates. However, for the days I do not want to intake so much carbohydrates, I will pick their lamb/ chicken/ fish/ steak. I personally recommend lamb the most as it is always full of the unique flavor of lamb meat (some people may not be fond of it though).As to dessert, there is nothing to complaint about. It generally provides a perfect end to a satisfying lunch.This is a place that you just cant miss it!', ""Today we went to Anitpasto for lunch today. The place is very cosy and chill, a good place to hang around with friends. They have a 3 courses set lunch & a la carte menu, also they have a good selection of wine menu too.

For main course, we took the beef penne pasta, filet fish with vegetables, sea food rice and chicken risotto. It also comes with a drink or dessert. The overall experience is excellent.

The appearance of this dish is not attractive.But I am glad that it didn\'t come with thick sauce.There are olive oil sprayed on the lettuce.

For long I didn\'t come across with such a chessy and rich fettuccine!!It looks simple but tastes perfectly. I can clearly taste the cheese and cream in the creamy sauce. They wrapped every piece of pasta!! The mussels are extremely sweet and fresh It seems that I am lucky to have this pasta of the day. If I really need to pick on the weakness of this dish it would be lack of ingredients in the pasta and not all of them are moisted.Pasta of the day - fettuccine in calm sauce1Pasta of the day - fettuccine in calm sauceMy friend originally ordered roasted lamb but the kitchen reported that there is no more lamb.

The 'Good' Starter - Sauteed prawnsOut of the 3 starters, I picked the sauteed prawns. To my pleasant surprise, I was presented with 5 large pieces of prawns, all nicely seasoned and cooked. Birthday gatheringAt a table next to us, they were celebrating the birthday of a friend. The staff (the owner actually) surprised the birthday gal with a birthday song and cake.   The 'Bad' The SirloinThe presentation and sauce were okay but the texture of the sirloin left much to be desired. It's sort of like biting on a worn-out tire, you get the idea!  The ServiceThe owner mentioned about 2 staff missing in action due to illness. Perhaps that's the reason why the service has been relatively slow, particularly the delivery of food.

36,Applegreen,Causeway Bay,American,3.9,93.5,0.0,"Three adults with one baby went at brunch time.  We ordered breakfast - Egg in the hole, and chicken salad.  Egg in the hole sounded a bit funny and when it came, we realized that it was a round shaped bread with a hole cut in the middle and replaced by an egg.  Interesting way to present and prepare the egg and bread for breakfast.  The egg is cooked fairly raw with both egg white and yolk still running.  Besides the egg and bread, there were plenty of sweet potato chips (a bit too rich for brunch for me), sausage and honey coated ham.  Sausage was average, but the ham was very well proportioned.  When the chicken salad came, we were surprised how BIG the salad was.  It was great with lots of green vegi and chicken strips.  And it was truly a green salad that the quantity of chicken was not overwhelming, unlike some other restaurants' offer.  We were also surprised with ample place in the restaurant considering we were in the middle of CWB in HK, where a street front shop cost HKD3m per month in rent.Overall, salad was fresh, and the breakfast was great value for money.  Two thumbs up."", ""Craving for some pasta, my boyfriend suggested Apple Green for brunch and so we went. Brunching at Apple Green is never lavish, but was pretty chill and relaxing. 1) Salmon Bagel with ChipsI love Plain Bagels with Sour Cream more0I love Plain Bagels with Sour Cream moreI have always love bagels, I love its shape, its texture and its taste. I personally reckon it goes best with sour cream which Apple Green had it on the side. As usual the portion in Apple Green is enormous since it served American size dishes. The portion was too huge for me, I literally had to take more than half of the salmon out of the bagel in order to enjoy it. There was simply too much salmon, if I have taken all of them, I think I will get salmon poisoned(jking). Awefully lots of Salmon!0Awefully lots of Salmon!The bagel was great, very spongy and soft! The cabbage was fresh but the purple onions were pretty raw which I had taken it out. (I hope I didn't take out too much ingredients out of the bagel lol.) The coleslaw wasn't something I am fond of, first there was too much dressing in it, second I don't like its taste. The crisps were home made, I quite like them, they were extremely crispy but the crispyness was very different from the typical packaged crisps. 2) Pesto PastaPesto was okay0Pesto was okayThe pasta looked appealing with a slice of french baguette on top. The baguette was toasted to make the already-crunchy baguette slightly more crunchy and finished off with a spread with garlic and butter to keep the center soft. The spaghetti was in generous portion. Each and every single strand was fully covered with pesto and olive oil to give a sparkly look. The combined taste of the pesto and olive oil made the spaghetti very tasteful and refreshing. Sadly the spaghetti was rather soft in texture. Overall, I do love dinning at Apple Green. I love the spaciousness and the relaxing ambience which I find very comfy to dine in. The only thing that I concern dinning at the restaurant is the fact that they serve American size which is too much for me, however it would be good if you are going to share with more people.P.S.

37,Arcane,Central,Italian,3.9,441.0,0.0,"I was browsing where to go for lunch in Central and found this restaurant with 1 Michelin star. Weekday lunch sets didn\'t seem expensive with costs of $348+10% for 2 courses and $398+10% for 3 courses. So I decided to come try.The restaurant was quite small but the interior decoration was pretty modern with a few paintings. Given the small size, tables were really so closely packed together so that I could hear some of my neighbours\' conversations over lunch.Lunch set2Lunch setWe came in a group of two and decided to try everything on their lunch menu so placed our orders right away without studying their menu in details.Bread with butter0Bread with butterAs commented by many other eaters, the bread was really unexpectedly disappointing. Really a bit hard to believe that such bread could be served at such a Michelin restaurant. There was only 1 type of bread with no choice. The crust was crispy but the interior was so thick and heavy. The butter was quite greasy but it was hard not to eat with butter. As you know bread was quite important at such restaurants as the portions of the dishes were quite small so you really need to eat some bread to fill your stomach. The server did keep asking if we would like to have more bread and also helped remove the bread crusts from the table before serving us desserts. I really hope they could do something to improve the bread.The appetisers were served to us very soon.Smoked salmon with jerusalem artichoke, lovage mayonnaise and capers...0Smoked salmon with jerusalem artichoke, lovage mayonnaise and capers...Smoked salmon with jerusalem artichoke, lovage mayonnaise and capersThe smoked salmon and the mayo were quite salty. The jerusalem artichoke couldn\'t balance the saltiness. The thin crisps on top did help enhance the texture of the dish, however, couldn\'t help enhance the rating of the dish. I could tell that the smoked salmon was fresh though.Salad of beetroot, endive and blood orange with seared duck heart and toasted walnut...0Salad of beetroot, endive and blood orange with seared duck heart and toasted walnut...Salad of beetroot, endive and blood orange with seared duck heart and toasted walnutIngredients were fresh. But the duck heart wasn\'t really fully cooked which could have been more chewy and tasted less bloody after being fully cooked. The toasted walnuts were so crushed and not toasted enough.

The sauce was very tasty in a rich flavour of ""butter"" or ""cream"". The potatoes were well cooked too, a bit chewy texture-wise. Appealing even to me who usually didn\'t like potatoes. There were a lot of crisps on top of the hake to enhance the texture. Delicious.Braised veal cheek with crushed white beans, morteau sausage, peas and tarragon...0Braised veal cheek with crushed white beans, morteau sausage, peas and tarragon...Braised veal cheek with crushed white beans, morteau sausage, peas and tarragonThe veal cheek was very well braised and was really tender. To pick bones from an egg, the beef flavour could have been richer though. The sauce was delicious too but a bit more salty than that of the fish dish. I was surprised to see a little bit of black truffle added to the dish but it didn\'t add much flavour to the dish overall. This was still a good dish but less good than the fish dish. By the way, we couldn\'t really find morteau sausage from the dish.After finishing our mains, it took a long long time for them to serve us desserts.Sweet corn ice cream with beurre noisette, kaffir lime chantilly...0Sweet corn ice cream with beurre noisette, kaffir lime chantilly...Sweet corn ice cream with beurre noisette, kaffir lime chantillyThis was quite a special dessert with very rich sweet corn flavour. If you hadn\'t tried it before, I would recommend it to you. Texture-wise it could have been better but the rating of 5 was given taking into account the creativity.Tomme de savoie with pear chutney and lavoche0Tomme de savoie with pear chutney and lavocheTomme de savoie with pear chutney and lavocheThis type of cheese was of the right degree of saltiness, which was pretty good. The thin crisps were fresh and good. The pear chutney was ok too, slightly sweet to balance the salty cheese, and I wish there were more.The set didn\'t include anything else like petite fours or amuse bouche or coffee/tea. Given the portion (especially the bread which was the major items to fill up your stomach), it was really a bit hard to justify the cost. Although location was central, the tables were too closely packed together for some privacy. Service was ok as the server did try to fill up my glass of water from time to time. It was a bit less efficient given the small number of dishes to serve. I would say I would rather top the price up a little bit to go somewhere for even better/more food and environment. Having tried all their items on the weekday lunch menu with some disappointments, I don\'t think I would go back again. That said, I would still give it an overall OK rating rather than a crying face.', ""Weekday lunch at Aracne. I went for the 3 course set lunch, priced at $398. A 2 course is also available at $328. All of the courses were very nice, I'd never had sweet corn ice cream but the combination really worked. I sat at the kitchen counter which is great to be a part of the action, but you might prefer a regular table for a more comfortable dining experience.

I loved the gnocchi and the braised beef.  But I was here again last week and the signature braised beef was off the menu!  But thankfully the gnocchi still is around and it's simply out of this world. It's the only thing I order here and I can never get tired of it... ever! You must come and try it!  It was easy to use their online reservation system and for lunch I was able to get a table just booking a few days in advance."", 'My friend Agent-I was back in town and I decided to bring her to Arcane where I haven\'t visited since its opening week last November. I must say, there was nothing really unpleasant from my previous visit but why didn\'t I return a bit earlier for another meal? 1Now my memory is coming back a bit. If there\'s one thing I found unsatisfied about my last visit at Arcane, it was the spacing in between tables. The space looked really small and a bit cramped as well. I didn\'t really want to listen in on my neighbors\' conversation but I kind of had no choice. This time around, things were a little different coz the restaurant was less than half full and we were able to spread out a bit with empty seats surrounding us.0I recalled a second thing that was bothering me too - the menu. It has only 2 choices for starter, 2 for main course (a fish and a meat) and 2 desserts (with one being the cheese dish). This is definitely not very good news for anyone that wants plenty of choices.After a slice of bread, I started things off the same way I did last time with their poached taiyouran egg, shiitake duxelle, broccoli, brioche crumbs and onion seeds. I am not sure if this is Chef Osborn\'s signature dish or not but it\'s a fairly good way to kick things off here.0I ""destroyed"" the taiyouran egg with my knife and let the egg yolk float all over the rest of the ingredients. That was so good. I thought it tasted a tad better than last time.

40,Assaggio Trattoria Italiana,Wan Chai,Italian,3.4,171.0,1.0,"Had not been to assagio for a long. I was asked to think of a place to go today so I searched on OpenRice. I wanted Italian cuisine and assagio pumped up. It ended up a good choice. Assagio is never a crowded place becoz its a bit away from the offices surrounding it but not far. You could enjoy a chill lunch with friends or business partners. Assagio offered quality food at a reasonable price. HKD168 with the buffet, plus HKD68 to HKD98 for a main course. Its a rather good price compared to other places around for semi buffet. The main course I order was a pan seared snapper. Minimal dressing, crispy skin. You got the chance to enjoy the hero of the dish. Ill come back again. Besides the main course, what I enjoyed the most was the fresh fruits, grapes, pineapple, watermelon and melon. They are all my favorite  0000', ""We were supposed to be going to Kasa for lunch today but what we didn't realize was the fact that they have changed to more of a take-away joint these days with very limited dine-in options. So, we had to take our business elsewhere. Preferably somewhere nearby.0Assaggio Trattoria Italiana is a close enough option at the Hong Kong Arts Centre. We got there in just a couple of minutes.0Spaghetti carbonara ($128) - I wasn't particularly hungry today so instead of having the antipasti buffet and a pasta, meat or pizza, I opted for a simple bowl of pasta. This was noticeably smaller in size but still every bit as good as it was. The homemade spaghetti was full of bite with just the right amount of cream sauce although I certainly didn't mind a bit more pancetta and shaved parmesan.Spaghetti carbonara$ 1280Spaghetti carbonara$ 128Assaggio tiramisu ($48) - They always have one of my favorite tiramisu in the city although I have noticed that the size has also shrunk a little like my previous pasta dish (but cheaper).Assaggio tiramisu$ 480Assaggio tiramisu$ 48Very creamy with that nice and soft texture. My recent favorite is the one from Pici but this one sure isn't too far behind.0"", ""I've been to Assaggio's TST branch a while ago but as it was on a weekend the salad buffet was more limited, and it was more of a small antipasto buffet plus main course lunch set. This is my first visit to Assaggio at the Art Centre and I was happy enough with what I had.For lunch, you can choose to have a salad bar buffet ($148+10%) only, or otherwise add a main course (pasta, risotto, pan-seared fish) for around $88 all the way to the mid $100s. You could also add dessert for an extra charge. Coffee and tea is not included in the set.I opted for the salad bar buffet only, and we were the first customers to arrive. The seats and tables are spacious and there's ample lighting in the entire dining room. Part of the seats would offer guests a peek of the action in the open kitchen. Waiting staff speak good English, but all but one were friendly and helpful. (The one waitress who didn't make us feel that welcome was slightly impatient when we requested to be moved to another table.) As we neared the end of our meal, the place was just over half full, so it does seem to be quite a busy place on a week day.01The salad bar has quite a lot to offer, for veggies, the selection ranges from romaine lettuce and argula all the way to grilled eggplant, bell pepper slices, carrots and cucumber. Cherry tomatoes were a fresh and juicy bright red and they also offer a slightly low-end version of my favorite caprese salad--though the mozzarella were slightly hard and not that fresh, it was good enough for me. The asaggio cheese was smooth (but not aged). There's also unlimited parmesan on offer if that's your thing. In terms of protein, they have some ham and salami and a chicken salad, but that's about it. They also have some bruschetta if you're still hungry after all the food.0The soup of the day was potato and leek soup. I really liked it. It was hearty and warming.0The salad bar.0My caprese salad with some greens.0Bread and ham.I failed to take a picture of the coffee, but it was a strong Italian coffee, freshly brewed."", ""I've been here three times. The first two times were fine but unfortunately the food has deteriorated. My lunch special came with a tiny portion of pasta, maybe 1 cup in all, for which I waited about 20-25 minutes for after my salad was cleared. Pasta was slightly overcooked and had bits of mushy broccoli in it. Salad bar was fairly fresh and had a good selection of cooked veggies, not much meat. Service is nice but super slow. Total bill came to 200 and I was still hungry afterwards."", ""Seems there were a lot of good reviews for this place so I decided to try it out with my folks on a Saturday lunch. The place was busy, so reservations are recommended. Last seating is 2:30pm. We were given a table just behind the reception, though it would have been nicer if we were in the main room where the salad bar was, or by the windows with a view. However the seating was comfortable, tables were well spaced out, and the place was lively but not noisy. There are counter-top seats where you can admire the bread-making process.An extra $30 for a salad bar? No brainer. The ingredients were very fresh,  with 3-4 choices of ham/meat, grilled veg, a couple of pasta and rice salad, several kinds of green leaf salad including my favourite arugula, boiled eggs with pesto, juicy tomatoes and a wonderful mandarin salmon, which was salmon sashimi marinated in a light and mild mandarin sauce, almost like a ceviche. There is additional bread there if the bread basket at the table doesn't satisfy your carb crave. The focaccia was delish, moist and herby, whilst the little white rolls had a great yeasty dough-like texture. The breadsticks unfortunately failed the test as it was soggy yet hard at the same time.For mains we ordered the spaghetti with anchovy sauce (smallest portion, simple dish, quite a strong anchovy taste), the mushroom risotto (a bit too sauce for my liking, but had a few kinds of mushrooms in it and the overall texture of the rice was good without being overcooked), and the lamb chops (definitely stole the show, very juicy and tender with just the right amount of fat). Risotto Funghi0Risotto FunghiSpaghetti in anchovy sauce0Spaghetti in anchovy sauceLamb chops0Lamb chopsMy mum also wanted to try the cod with chickpeas, and despite using a good piece cod that flaked easily, the chickpeas didn't quite go with it as it still had a faint metallic taste from the can. Perhaps a pesto or tomato sauce would have went down as a better combo.Cod with chickpeas0Cod with chickpeasDessert was a platter of carrot cake (they ran out of cheesecake), brownie and chocolate cake that resembled a scoop of icecream. Perfect for sharing. If you're too full already, consider a nice cup of tea or coffee in place of the dessert.Dessert platter0Dessert platterThe prices are VERY reasonable, with set lunches ranging from $88 up, though a la carte dishes such as the cod was $198 and wasn't such great value in comparison. It was good that the chef took an active interest in the way things were happening on the floor and he was seen more than once commandeering the team. The waitress/waiters are friendly and generally helpful in clearing away dishes and refilling (free!) water.Two thumbs up for a good value Italian meal."", ""This place is overrated!My BF and I chose this restaurant because we expected to have a relaxing & delicious lunch.... and it was anything but this!Firstly, you better reserve a table before you come if you really want to come. We were fortunate to be able to get a sidetable by simply walking in (perhaps it wasn't so much of a blessing afterall).  Anyway, we were kindly advised by a busy staff to make a reservatioin next time. And later we felt we were LUCKY after all for walking in, because there would be a surcharge for reservation!Yes... service mediocre...Oh well, we sat down and read through the menu.  The antipasti bar looks nice, and so we ordered two set lunch with it.  We tried to wave to the staff to take an order, but they never seem to see us.  When we place the order, the staff looked quite annoyed, prolly because she was extremely busy (she need to take the calls, take orders & assign tables). But frankly, we saw quite a lot of staff in there, and all of them seems to be working in a clumsy way. I think there should be a better division of labour in here, otherwise everything is slow, inefficient & you end up to get annoyed staff. So blame it on bad management.For the food...  still mediocreDon't get me wrong!    The quality of the antipasti bar is good. You get the basic salad, some tasty italian rice (something like risotto but less thick i guess) etc.  However, I warn you that if you arrive late, you may not be able to taste the good stuff.  We arrived at around 12pm, and was FORTUNATE again to get the final bites of a mouthful of italian rice. BUT... the main course.... is a disappointment.Some-kind of fish pasta that we got. Bad fish taste. PERIOD. (see below) My BF and I cant finish it.....0The fungi risotto is such a disappointment!!! Extraordinarily ordinary!  I fancy all kinds of risotto but this is nothing near my expectation!!!!!!!0I don't know what else I could say about the main course....As for the dessert... mediocre again.of coz we don't expect anything too special because it is included in the set. BUT that was again... mediocre even for my sweet tooth. I love to eat desserts, but this is =.=  Just some kind of cream with an ordinary biscuit. Way tooooo sweet for me.  Because this lunch/dessert didnt satisfy me, we went to a yogurt shop nearby 0In the end, it is nothing delicious nor relaxing.... it is modiocre food & service. The service is slow & inefficient, but didn't give you a 'relax' feeling because of all the clumsiness we experienced.Oh, just before I end my ventilation and to be fair,  I would say the scenery is quite nice (if u minus the construction site, poor service/food)0 0To conclude, this place is a sheer disappointment!! There are so many other places in HK that offer better service/food at the same price."", 'Apparently it is another new restaurant of the Miramar Hotel Group.  Walked in just by chance.Environment:It is great! The location is strategic, feel like away from the crowd but with proximity to Central/Admiralty area. Large windows with good views and the ""bar style"" table along and facing the window gives solo customers an extra layer of leisureness. Inside deco is nice and decent, has a modern touch but still feel warm and cozy. There is room of improvement in its music though. Like some other restaurants of the same group (e.g. Hide-Chan), the music is sometimes annoying (too strong with repeatitive strong beat), especially seats close to the speakers.  Services:Very proactive and friendly, with attention to the details. Some wait staffs serve with a passion. Good!Food:I went there for lunch and ordered a la carte. Ordered a pasta and a tiramisu. Both are made to order. Freshness is always something that I treasure in food. The pasta is delicious but a bit oily. The food there is not cheap compared to its peers in the vicinity but I find them reasonably priced.

Nice complimentary food and the only deep fried Mars bar with ice cream on the block.  And the bratwurst are excellent, as tasty as any and include some healthier choices. I had the Habanero which was excellent. Bad news? Well, the appetizer platters were a little skimpy for 168 each. But the hot wings on them were good---the rest (chicken fingers, some bread and scrawny calamari) were fair.The brats themselves are a little expensive. All these can be forgiven. But the waiting time for the food was ridiculous. We got our appetizer trays AFTER all the food had been served. They served all the fires well before any other food was brought out ---now we were a group of 11, but we were the only customers in the restaurant. They really have to iron out the kinks if this joint is going to make it.', ""After a morning of hiking DOWN from Peak to Fong (HKDR), me and my friends decided to try out BRAT.  My friends are sausage lovers but I'm only so-so.  I don't really like sausages, i don't like how the meat is minced and squished into this tube.This place offers 10+ types of sausages!!! Can you believe it??The 4 of us ordered the sausage sampler.  Its basically 4 sausages of our choice & it comes with condiments (Mustard, Caramelized onions, etc).  We picked:1/ Sun-dried Tomato (my fav)2/ Gruyere3/ Jalapeno4/ MushroomLike i said earlier, I'm not a sausage fan so I found Sun Dried tomato to be the most impressive out of all those we ordered. However, I have to say, its one of the best sausage meal i've ever had.Its not greasy, its light.  You can definitely savor the freshness and quality of meat they put into this tube.  The sausage is really juicy and flavorful.  Its almost as if you're eating a piece of meat, not minced meat.  Hmm..That's all I remembered from that visit even though we ordered sweet potato fries, caesar salad, and some breakfast set. Oh wait....for the breakfast set we ordered scrambled egg.  I would like to bring to your attention that the egg was grade A quality with bright yellow yolk, meaning its probably not those mass produced eggs that you get from standard supermarket.  The set also comes with diced tomato with basil, and its very refreshing. In terms of price, its not cheap but it can be justified by the quality and freshness of their food.I'll definitely give it another try""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-brat/48410?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

We reserved our table at 1230 and were offered corner booth seating, making us feel more relaxed and privacy.There were quite some sets served and we finally ordered the Orecchiette and Pizza Taleggio.01) Caeser salad () & Daily Soup ():I did not expect much from the Caeser salad but found the daily soup quite light and fresh, with small chucks of tomato.Caeser salad & Daily Soup 0Caeser salad & Daily Soup 2) Orecchiette Porcini e Gamberi ($78) (): Orechhiette are shaped like small ears, slightly dome-shaped that give a mix of soft and chewy texture. Mild taste of porcini mushroom and the topping of Parmesan are balanced well, without making the pasta too creamy. The portion is just the right amount but big-eater having more quota can always have more, perhaps to enjoy the dessert of the day as well.Orecchiette Porcini e Gamberi0Orecchiette Porcini e Gamberi3) Pizza Pizza Taleggio ($78) (): The crust is of the right thickness, being soft and chewy. There are bacon, potato slices, filled with mixed cheese. And right in the middle, it's the half boiled, soft runny egg yolks! The waitress kindly waited until camera 'eats' first before she helped cutting the pizza into slices. A kind reminder to eat the pizza while the egg yolk is still runny and warm. Dipping the pizza with the egg yolk sauce adds a bit of salty favour and silky smooth texture. It really goes so well with the soft dough that I had two slices of pizza in a row without feeling overwhelmed.Pizza Pizza Taleggio0Pizza Pizza TaleggioPizza Pizza Taleggio0Pizza Pizza TaleggioPizza Pizza Taleggio0Pizza Pizza TaleggioThis is quite a decent place for a quiet lunch, with very reasonably-priced Italian/western lunch sets.

48,Baby Blue Cafe & Bar (Shooters A3),Causeway Bay,Italian,4.2,80.0,,"Came here for lunch with a bunch of friends.  Food:  We ordered:  Baked mussels with bacon and onions;  Blue mussels with white wine sauce and baguette set;  Oxtail braised in red wine sauce set;  Baked pork chop set; Mushroom risotto set;  and Indonesian fried rice set.  Mussels - good and fresh.  The baked mussels with bacon and onions came with juicy bits of bacon and onion baked into each mussel served over mashed potatoes layer.  Mussels were still very juicy although baked.  The mussels with white wine sauce was a lighter alternative, came on a platter which I appreciated over a bucket, so I could dip my baguette into the sauce.  I'm glad I found a place in CWB that will satisfy my mussels cravings at a very reasonable price.Oxtail and risotto were done well as well.  Oxtail was very soft and tender with the sauce tasty but not overpowering.  I had a side of french fries which I loved soaked with the sauce.  Risotto had good texture and pieces of mushroom. The Indonesian fried rice was very random considering this is a Belgium restaurant, but it was decent.  Baked pork chop was OK, would not recommend highly. All sets came with either soup/salad and coffee/tea and dessert.  Clam chowder was good, came with clams.  Dessert was small jello shot with fruit inside, simple and enough after a huge meal.Service:  Amazing service - our waitress Rosanna especially was very attentive and thoughtful.  She gave suggestion that we order the mussel set over a la carte for better value.  Also she changed plates when they needed changing, turned up the air conditioning when she noticed it was slightly warmer (we sat next to the window, with lots of sun).   At the end, my friend left his wallet there and the restaurant dutifully called him back to get it, so that's an extra plus.Sizing it up:  The lunch sets were ranging from $38 to $108.  The oxtail set was $52 and the mussels with white wine was $108.  Portions were huge that we gasped when the food came on the table.  Also, I walked out with a coupon that had 5 stamps, if you collect 6 stamps, you get 1 lunch set free, so another WOW.  Also, we had buy 1 get 1 free drinks, happy hour - so half litre Hoegarddens and glasses of house wine were good value.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-baby-blue-cafe-bar-shooters-a3/6203?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

The place is small, but I had my visit at weekdays, so there wasn't so many customers, still a lovely place to spend a morning and chill with friends.Hope to visit again soon!000"", ""Bagels are pretty rare in Hong Kong. Well, good ones anyways. First there was R&R Bagels which gave me hope in the world of bagels in Hong Kong. Now there is another.

It's not very big but they have limited indoor and outdoor seating.0Menu is in English and Chinese. They have various types of bagel sandwiches.0They also have something called a bagel pizza?0And various drinks. You can get a minor discount with a drink if you order a bagel.0So, I ordered the Pastrami Bomb ($70) and added $20 for a sweet lychee rose tea. The tea was fairly sweet indeed and no sugar was added. It was a whole tea bag and smelled nice as well. But I wasn't here for tea. I wanted a bagel.The Pastrami Bomb included pastrami, mustard, gherkin, tomato, Swiss cheese, rocket lettuce and cream cheese. You can choose any bagel variety that they have available. I chose sun dried tomato. The bagel was pretty good. A nie dense texture. It was also toasted and I loved how they wrapped it in paper and sliced it half for easier handling. The pastrami was great and went well with the sharp gherkin. The cream cheese was smooth and balanced out the strong Swiss. A fairly well built sandwich.0A lot cheaper than R&R Bagel and just as good. The bagels were good and I like their combinations. I would return again and just purchase a bagel to build my own sandwich."", ""My secret lunch spot at Bagels Alley today  I love the classic Everything Bagel made from Bagoes , it was chewy inside but I preferred the inner fillings from BLT   the bacon was salty & flavourful  it was cooked perfectly!

50,Baikohken Ramen,Causeway Bay,Japanese,1.7,98.0,0.0,"I have a friend who thinks ramen is just overpriced instant noodles. I was horrified by this remark as I love ramen. I love the rich broth. The chewy noodles. The luscious egg. The melt in your mouth char siu. Yes, I love ramen and I\'m always on the look out for new ramen restaurants that open up on Hong Kong.A new ramen place has opened up in Tang Lung Street .... or what most like to call it ""Ramen Street"" as there are already five ramen restaurants in that small little side street. Called  (English name: Baikohken Ramen), it hails from Hoikkaido and has even plastered the Michelin logo on it as it\'s a Michelin recommended restaurant in Japan. Intrigued, I went to go try it out.0The place is small and is located in the old Lobster Central location. In fact, they didn\'t even bother to renovate much. The layout is the same.Menu is in English and Chinese. There is no 10% service charge. Tea is provided for you. There is no free for all water jug like other places.0Ordering is by checking off a piece of paper. There are no real options for you to customize your ramen like other places as well. After you order, you are expected to pay at the same time.0I wasn\'t too interested in the lobster ramen that was advertised in the media. I just wanted something simple so ordered this: flame grilled rib char siu ramen in soy sauce broth ($98).The broth was pale in color and there was no depth of flavor other than salty. I\'m wondering if they gave me the wrong broth? The egg was flavorless, though the yolk was still runny.0The char siu didn\'t look too flame grilled. The char siu was ok. Tender without being too fat.0But it was the ramen. Did they just give me instant ramen? It looked like it. It had the same texture. The same taste. There was a horrible starchy after taste. It was soggy. Is this for real?0Probably the worst ramen I\'ve ever had in Hong Kong. The service was fine. Friendly, in fact. But the ramen? Starchy aftertaste. Over cooked. The soup just salty and not rich at all. Definitely overpriced instant noodle. I won\'t be back.'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-baikohken-ramen/555952?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

They offer a DIY soup noodles as well for those that want to create your own starting at $58 for three items.1I just basically ordered the Hainan chicken with vermicelli ($70). It arrived in an oval sized bowl. The soup had a lovely flavor of herbs. The vermicelli was chewy and good enough. The chicken was boneless and very moist. It came with a piece of daikon that soaked up the soup so it was a bit salty.0I chose the Bangkok milk tea. There was a lot of ice. But it tasted pretty good. The tea wasn't rough on my tongue and went down smooth. The condensed milk was sweet enough without overpowering the spices.0The food was delicious for a reasonable enough price .

Other drinks are available, coconut water and fresh lime with soda for an extra$10 and soft drinks for an extra $5. There are snack add ons with items such as spring rolls, prawn cakes, vegetables for an additional of $20 to $38. I didn't order any of their snacks.My lunch came really quickly, which felt like a minute after I ordered! Overall, the noodles were ok. The chicken was the highlight - tender, and tasty. Their noodles were just ok. The noodle strands were really easy to break off with a chopstick, so it was quite difficult to eat. I ended up using a spoon to scope up the broken noodles because I couldn't pick it up with my chopsticks.

I had meatballs and the wife had a simple tomato sauce. Fine but not outstanding.Beer tasted fresh through the pipes and the coffee was hot, fresh and strong.Whilst the pasta wasn't amazing, the added salad and meats made up for it and we both came away filling contentedly full - still am actually.Worth a visit."", ""First I have to thank school for giving me one extra day-off, something which is much-needed in this hectic life of mine. Having no lessons at all (HURRAY!) I could enjoy great flexibility on my lunch-whereabouts. Having heard and read about the antipasti/salad bar lunch buffet, I could at last squeeze sometime to actually give it a try.Apparently Barolo had raised the price of the lunch sets by an average of +$20 as the waitress politely explained to me that the Salad Bar lunch set now costs $128 instead of $108, or $98 stated on its (apparently)outdated website. You get a salad bar buffet, pasta, dessert and tea/coffee by paying $138. This narrow difference of $10 is tempting but since we went only for the salad, we decided to give it a no-no and head for the salad bar instead.This place is actually more of a bar than a restaurant - we were allocated a bar table which was rather comfortable to sit and eat. The place was crowded with Central lunch-breakers who are mostly foreigners. They looked kinda in a rush - hurrying to return to their workplaces before the stock market opens again at 1:30?  As they buzz around like bees we just looked around lazily, and I felt quite funny being surrounded by people constantly moving swiftly while I was completely in the holiday mood, wanting just to sit back and relax a bit.  After a few minutes of relaxation we could at last move our asses off the comforty bar chairs and moved to inspect the salad bar spread.Impressive spread of antipasti0Impressive spread of antipasti What we saw was indeed impressive: plates after plates of fresh salads and antipasti were laid on the long bar table.What a scene. You actually start from the right of the bar to the left were the espresso machine is: first were the soup, bread and plain salad veggies, then the cheese and the cold cuts and the grills, and last were the fruits. There were approximately 15~20 kinds of food available.Bland goat cheese0Bland goat cheeseConventionally I started with the plain salads and bread: the  bread basket offered at least 3 kinds of bread including french baguettes, flaxseed wholewheat buns and a sour dough. Pity that they had been dehydrated under the strong ventilation, but they actually tasted okay with the crunchy crust and soft(if you tear away the tough parts which has exposed in air for too long), and i guess they should go well with the  cream of mushroom soup , which i did not bother to try. Nice  salad veggies tho and there were four dressings which you could choose from, plus some really nice and crunchy croutons, cheese(is it cheddar or edam?cant tell) wedges and thin crisps which you could top your salad with, not to mention the really juicy cherry tomato which went well with the thousand island dressing. The Tomato with Mozzarella looked better than it tasted as the cheese was a bit rubbery in texture but literally tasteless. The comment applies for the goat cheese  which, sadly, did not even tasted like cheese at all but resembled crumbled soap.  This was really disappointing as i was expecting quite a lot from its cheese collection...anyway, theres still other antipasti which i could give my heart to.   Smoked salmon  was okay but tasted a little too salty, but that could be moderated by a good squeeze of lemon juice.Some were good, some were bad0Some were good, some were badNext I basically sampled with EVERYTHING ON ONE SINGLE PLATE!!WOHOO! luckily most were vegetables or else i would have killed myself for gorging in so much meat and fat in one single meal. Parma ham that you should not miss0Parma ham that you should not missAnyway, the  parma ham  was truly delicious - they were of the correct thickness and were not too fat nor salty; the cantaloupe was sweet and went well with the ham.  Matter of fact I thought the parma ham here tasted better than what's served at Tiffin's or The Lounge@J.W. Marriott!  There was the big wedges of  grilled pumpkin  which i treated myself generous shares as they were truly delicious. You have to pick the softer ones as they were better seasoned. They were quite buttery in texture and I just used them to 'butter' the dry bread! There were two drier mixes of chicken peas  and some suspicious seed-like stuff, which i did not quite like. The  Grilled mushrooms and zucchini and eggplants  were nicely grilled and juicy, however; the  clam salad and grilled broccoli and cauliflower was disappointing however as they were not too fresh nor tasty.  Fresh fruits0Fresh fruitsLast were the fruits - the pineapple, cantaloupe and watermelon  were all fresh, juicy and sweet.Lovely Biscotti0Lovely BiscottiWe ordered two English breakfast teas which came with a lovely piece of almond biscotti , which served as the most appropriate 'petite sweetness' to the salad buffet lunch.Now perhaps you will ask: wheres the oyster? I was thinking of the same question and apparently Barolo had taken away quite a lot of food from the lunch menu. Stuff like the cheese variety and some seafood items were missing. That was indeed a huge disappointment, given that they had raised the charge per head from $108 to $128.  Had i been aware of the changing menu, I would not have been here for lunch - it is not very economical of me to have a salad lunch at $128+s.c.To conclude - great place and great service, the food was okay, but the choice was a bit too narrow given that the restaurant is charging people around $135 per head. Perhaps i should have tried Bistecca Italian Steak House or Bourbon instead.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-barolo/42510?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

For $88 each, nothing to complain.The bacon cheese burger is great, patty is medium and the bun is not as airy as the JOY place. The only down size is it doesn't come with side dishes. Caesar salad is not too saucy which I love, lettuce is fresh, with pulled chicken and croutons, all of good quality.I had a bite of the bacon egg roll and it is a surprise.

The team behind Beef & Liberty are pretty confident in their product and proud of their location, which they proclaim on their website as being the best location for burgers in Honkers! I'm not so sure about that, but trendy Wan Chai is changing pretty quickly and the second floor location (above Pizza Express) in Wing Fung Street is very convenient.Paying homage to the beefsteak clubs of old, Beef & Liberty takes its name from the beefsteak club phenomenon that (apparently) formed part of the 18th century's gastronomic culture: I didn't really know that there was a gastronomic culture in the 18th century (outside of Paris), but you live and learn! Whether or not the team have replicated the essence of the 18th century 'Sublime Society' founded by John Rich (look it up) or not is probably not too relevant, but what is pretty darn relevant is the approach Beef & Liberty takes to creating their burgers.0Using only hormone-free grass-fed beef, sourced from a small-scale farmers in Hobart, the Hereford and Angus cattle, Beef & Liberty take pains to ensure only the finest quality beef is passed onto their patrons. Using grass-fed and hormone-free beef is important, not only for the superior flavour of the beef, but the leaner cows produce higher levels of Omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin E, making them super healthy to boot (please note, I am not a doctor and cannot substantiate that comment).There is a pretty decent looking menu at Beef & Liberty, with the obvious plethora of burgers on offer, there are also options for those less inclined to dine out on burgers. All hailing from from the southern part of the US, there are some sides and salads that look interesting, along with some smaller sliders and some sumptuous looking desserts.We were there for burgers though, and that's what we ordered, along with a side of fries to share. Drinks were kept simple, I went for the vanilla shake and the girl went for 'gunner', which was a ginger ale with a dash of Angostura bitters thrown in for good measure. Both were tops, with the vanilla shake being super creamy and vanilla(ry) and the ginger ale quite gingery.0I'd kept my selection simple and went for the classic, which says everything you need to know about my preferences for burgers, the simpler the better. I'd asked for my burger to come out medium and was a little dismayed to find my burger still mooing, and bleeding all over the place. I was impressed with the look of my burger though, the magic ratio of beef to buns to salad was perfect. The classic contained the Tasmanian beef patty, butter lettuce, tomato and red onion (I'd skipped on the pickles) and the salad was fresh and nice. In fact, bleeding and rare patty aside, the burger was quite tasty, perhaps lacking a little seasoning, but quite satisfying overall.00The girl had gone all US on me, ordering the Bacon Cheese, which couldn't have been more different than mine, but it did come with (you guessed it) bacon, melty cheese and bacon jam. She'd also asked for medium but her burger had suffered the same fate as mine, getting a light grilling before being slapped onto the buns and sent on its way. It also needed a little extra seasoning, although the bacon jam helped a little with the seasoning.0Reading a few online reviews, it seems as if receiving a medium rare or even rare patty is pretty normal, something which the team at Beef & Liberty will have to watch out for.While there were a couple of little issues with the burgers, there was no such issue with the side of chips. I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say they could quite possibly be the best chips slash fries in all of Honkers! The crisp golden outer was seasoned perfectly, and cooking the chips with the skins on had helped retain that lovely potato flavour that signifies great chips. Even better was the soft and fluffy interior, which when combined with that golden crunchy outer made for good eating!0We'd decided not to order dessert, but were completely surprised when the wait staff brought over a complimentary dessert for us to share. It was totally unexpected but none-the-less really appreciated, especially since it was the wonderful banoffee! The pretty looking dessert had a perfect round of crispy oats as a base, then was covered in a banana and caramel cream that really rocked our world. The cream was really light and the caramel had that ever-so-slightly-bitter twang that good caramel has. Mixing the bitter and the sweet always goes down well, and so did the banoffee.0It was pretty quiet when we arrived at Beef & Liberty for our lunch, and we were a bit bummed that we were given the smallest and crappiest table in the dining room. Sure, it filled up quite a bit while we were there, but we'd have felt more comfortable on a table that was bigger than a postage stamp (well, maybe a little bigger than that).There is a really modern feel to Beef & Liberty, and the dining space is much larger than most of the other burger joints in Hong Kong. I couldn't say that it's very American(y) inside the dining room, even though the back wall is dominated by a mural created by American artist Cyrcle. The room is dominated by a kitchen that's largely hidden behind a glass wall, and I for one would have preferred the kitchen to be open for all to see.Service was acceptable on the day, we did have a little trouble getting the attention of our waiter to pay the bill, but on the other hand, the team did send us out a complimentary dessert, so I can't complain too much.Would I go back to Beef & Liberty? It's a good question, and one that would be dependent. I'm thinking of moving from the Mid Levels to Wan Chai in a couple of months, so if that happens, I guess I could become a regular. My only ask would be that a medium burger come out as medium. I don't mind them bloody, but it needs to be on my terms!@FoodMeUpScotty0Quite a well thought out logo, the B & L clearly on display0The light brioche bun was light and just the right thickness0The golden ratio of beef x bun x salad was spot on0Yeah, who doesn't like a free dessert!0I'd loved it if the kitchen was more open - for the world to see0Quite cramped in the dining room though0Yeah, they sell beer on their pretty comprehensive drinks list0It's a modern space and I'll be back"", ""Scotch Egg - HKD68was an excellent appetiser to kick start the meal, the old English Pork ball made crispy was meaty and flavourful. It was paired with quail egg, slightly less powerful in taste than the normal egg but still good.4Black Pepper Burger + Bacon - HKD113+15was reasonably priced in good portion. The burger bun is a Sourdough made in house, it was made very crispy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside. It is interesting that Beef & Liberty uses sourdough, but I don't like it too much.4The burger combination was great, all flavours compliment each other well. The beef patty was meaty, lean, juicy but unfortunately weak on beef flavour. The sharp peppercorn taste was balance excellently with the sweet onion jam. The ogleshield cheese was flavourful, adding extra kick to the burger. The Wicks English was made utterly crispy, smokey and flavourful.5Good sweet potato fries - HKD32in generous portion. Made crispy in the outside and soft on the inside. Yum!5"", 'Going ""classic"" is always the way to go when trying out new burger places. I think simple fillings will let you focus on the main character more - the beef. The ""Classic"" choice was plainly with beef, butter lettuce, tomato and red onions.Beef & Liberty has its beef patty totally right! Just beef-y enough and the mmm ummm grilled-flavor. I ordered medium rare thinking that Hong Kong restaurants tend to overcook all their beef, yet this place took their temperature very seriously and literally, so I would do medium at the next visit. I would say I prefer B&L than the biggest/latest hit in town, The Butchers Club Burgers, because their patty was slightly too gamey for my taste (yes, I know, because they use serious dry-aged beef).My family also shared the Rocket & Mandarin Orange Salad, Sweet Potato Fries [heavenly and addictive] and Apple Pie with Creme Anglaise [fairly large in portion]. They were all homey tasting and great, making me think that any items on the menu were worth trying.Classic burger0Classic burgerI wanted to make a special mention on the service. All servers were real professional but retaining their chatty, casual attitude. It felt good to find servers that would chit chat a bit instead of just putting in your order and getting food to your table. It sounds like ""duh, all restaurants should be like that"" but it is rare in Hong Kong.My mom ordered her burger also in medium rare and found that it too ""pink"". She thought she could take it but after a few bites, nehhh. We asked to re-cook it a bit further, nicely of course. The server gladly took it back and came back with a new burger awhile later!! And guess what, she took it off the bill!! Ok, PLEASE DON\'T take advantage of this but this is the kind of service that keeps people coming back; that customer satisfaction is the key to any business success, even if I\'m earning a few dollars less this time.Menu0Menu', ""At long last, a burger that hits the spot in HK.We have tried pretty much all the others, Burgeroom, Shake 'em Buns, Corner Burger etc etc... They all fail to deliver on many levels. It was with possible disappointment in our hearts that we tried Beef & Liberty. It was unfounded as it turned out. B&L delivered a spectacular burger that was a screaming success.We both opted for cheeseburgers cooked medium (is there any other kind of burger - I think not). We also ordered some sweet potato fries with cajun aioli. The burgers came out and looked the business. I removed the lettuce from mine and ate it seperately, but it was crisp and fresh. The moment I bit through the soft, yet toothsome bun, through the high quality molten cheese, which had elasticity and give in equal measures and into the perfect patty, was like the world stopped for a heartbeat. THIS was the burger I have been dreaming about in HK.In England we have Byrons burgers. My wife is American and I have been taken to some great places in the US. This is the kind of great burger you get in those places. The bread was good. Soft enough to give way, but with enough integrity not to fall apart or turn to mush. The cheese was a good quality melter. It was biteable and chewy, but didn't pull off the patty on the first bite. The star, as it should be, was the patty. The problem with many places in HK is that they don't season the patty correctly, relying on the condiments to do the flavouring, and also that the texture is off. Here, the patty was a perfect grind (not too course, not too fine) and well seasoned. It was also cooked to perfection - no temperature errors. The burgers are served with bread and butter pickles on the side which, while good, are a little sweet for my taste - I prefer a dill pickle, but that's a personal preference.The sweet potato fries were delicious, crunchy and soft. The centre was fluffy and light, but the outside was crispy. They tasted great, especially dipped into the Cajun aioli. I could have eaten them all day long.The service at B&L is also very good. The staff are friendly and attentive, but leave you alone enough to enjoy your meal. I like that the bill does not automatically add a service charge, but does have the calculation for a 10, 15 or 20% tip at the bottom, so you don't need to work it out. The environment is nice - spacious and airy and the glass fronted kitchen looks clean and modern. Spotless in fact. OK, so a cheeseburger is $100. It's worth it.

Nestled on top of the Pizza Express on Star Street in Admiralty, most of us are misled by its name and thought it\'s a burger joint run by the Liberty Exchange group, but Beef & Liberty is actually a Shanghainese brand which is known for using 100% Australian grass-fed cattle for its high quality burgers, or so it claims.0The weather was rather cool and gloomy that day. Yves and Brown Sugar, being their sporty-selves, suggested we walk from Causeway Bay to the restaurant which seemed far at first, but it only took us around 20 minutes to get there in the end. When we arrived at the building, we saw T standing at the entrance for Pizza Express, looking clueless by himself. It turned out that to be able to get up to Beef & Liberty on 3/F, we needed to use the elevator at Pizza Express, and this was confusing.0Once the elevator opened to 3/F, a friendly waitress greeted us with a smile and led us to our booth next to the window. Although the restaurant wasn\'t a big place, its high ceilings and decoration rendered a casual and hip vibe. The booth was however quite small for 6 people. When we saw that there was a very reasonably priced ""All Day Set"" on the menu, we were quite excited until C drew our attention to the smaller print underneath which stated that ""All Day Set"" was not available on weekends, which was a total bummer! As J and Julie were ""fashionably/excusably/absolutely"" late again, we decided to order some drinks first. The price tags of this place were on the hefty side and lunch was priced at around $200 to $250 per person.0(1) The drinks we ordered failed on multiple levels and it was definitely not the best way to start our meal. The Liberty Iced Peppermint Tea ($32) Brown Sugar ordered looked good but tasted like normal iced tea soaked in peppermint leafs with too much ice.Liberty Iced Peppermint Tea ($32)0Liberty Iced Peppermint Tea ($32)(2) We knew we wouldn\'t be getting freshly squeezed lemonades for the Liberty Fresh Lemonade ($32) but this un-fresh drink could use a more suiting name: iced lemon water.

The Crispy Chicken Wings ($62/4 pieces) with Korean spicy sauce were intensely satisfying. The size for each chicken wing was big enough. Although the use of Korean spicy sauce was perhaps inspired by the widely popular Korean TV show, we were certainly blown away by the alluring spiciness and the delightfully crispy skin.

The burger was accomplished where the beef was exquisitely juicy and tender, while melted cheddar cheese and the house BBQ sauce composed a complex and fine taste!

We don\'t need to be having top quality beef burgers to enjoy a meal- most meals I have are far from good or healthy but I like them and I enjoy them. Beef & Liberty\'s biggest disappointment is wasting a perfectly good opportunity to become the next hit burger joint in Hong Kong and being unable to live up to its expensive price tags and our high expectations it set up. If only the dishes were worthy of the restaurant, it does just about everything right -- the decoration, the service and the goodwill idea. For a farewell party, we were happy with its ambience. For a burger place, it is just a blank void as vacuous as the brand itself.', ""The first door (right) stil has the Pizza Express logo on it...0The first door (right) stil has the Pizza Express logo on it...We had some difficulty finding this place, it wasnt until we walked up and down the slopes twice did we realize the entrance of Beef and Liberty was unobtrusively tucked inside Pizza Express.

It's rare you have an open space in Hong Kong, and Beef & Liberty have obviously put some thought into the interior.

We sampled the Black Pepper Burger ($108) and the Green Pepper Burger ($98). These essentially had similar flavours despite the difference in the auxiliary ingredients; the key differentiating factor was the black pepper, which was overwhelmingly strong towards the end. (Also explains why their choice of vegetables was rocket, where the green pepper burger used the much milder butter lettuce).

59,Bella Vita,Causeway Bay,Italian,3.4,363.3,,"We always count down for weekends as we struggle to work in the midst of a busy week. Weekends mean not only day-offs, but also opportunities for us to loosen up our collars, mute our blackberries, go for a walk in nature maybe, just to do what we please to relax our tired minds. To me, nothing is more relaxing than having a slow and enjoyable brunch at weekend. Not that I don't have time for breakfast during the weekdays; but how relaxing can brekkie be, when you have lectures and tutorials to follow and readings and assignments to work on, and you have to literally grab the notes with one hand and your dearest 'breakfast' with your another?0Having read about Bella Vita's superb Sunday brunch from a magazine, I decided to give it a try on a special day - April fool's day! Absolutely my day it is haha.0We booked a table in great advance fearing for a full-house, but our worries casted away as we arrived at the restaurant up on The Cubus, a new 'gastro' building near Lee Garden. The restaurant was not particularly spacious, but since it was not very filled, we customers could enjoy some air of privacy in the cozy yet comfty interior. We were given a table the inner most 'room', so that means a short walk everytime to the buffet spread near the entrance in a room filled with sunshine.0The long white table was filled with amazing-looking appetizers and seafood - from greens to cheeses, from parma to smoked salmon, from grilled eggplant to seafood salad...00What attracted us most, however, are definitely the little heaps of boston lobsters and king prawns - they were HUGE! The prawn in particular was as big as an adult's palm, making them look more like sea monsters than edible crustaceans haha.0At the other end was an action-station (I learnt this term only lately) for - disappointedly, not foie gras on toast, but fish crudo on toast. The chef explained that frying foie gras produced too much oil and smoke, so they switched to something less smoking. I believe that to be an excuse however, as foie gras was available (how surprising) a few weeks after my visit. 0This Sunday brunch was superb not only because of the buffet spread, but also the selection of main course and free-flowing champagne, red and white wines, and fresh juices. $498+10% is really a bargain not to be missed, and we were glad that we made it before the promotion of free-flowing drinks ended in mid-April. As a greedy glutton I tried to sample with everything available. Among the appetizers I was disappointed by the staleness and blandness of the mozzarella cheese, but the Italian cold cuts and cheeses spelt love - great to go with Champagne or the slightly dry white wine.0The seafood tasted as great as they looked, and we indulged in the luxury of eating the juicy and sweet prawn that could not be finished in one bite (but a few - it was THAT big!).Boston lobster is not my favorite species of the delicious crustacean, yet the claws and flesh were sweet and spongy enough to shut my complains. Some lobsters were full of sweet soft roes, and I'm sure people fond of this will have a great time exploring the heap of lobsters for an exceptional fertile one! 0I was not let down by the fact that foie gras was replaced by fish crudo - I am not especially fond of the fried fat liver anyway. Fish crudo, in the chef's words, was 'sashimi'. I thought it strange to use a Japanese term to explain an Italian cuisine so I checked up the web and discovered the term 'crudo', which I believe is referring to the thinny sliced raw fish served here. The chef first pan-fried a piece of toast, toppled it with tomato sauce, olive sauce and garlic (making up an Italian tricolor flag) and fish 'sashimi'.Strange as it may sound, this toast was extraordinarily tasty and we both had seconds! We didn't know that raw fish would go so well with pesto and crunchy toasts. The bread soaked up some oil and might be a bit oilish, yet the freshness and slight sourness of the fish balanced the fatty feeling of the bread. It was also very crunchy, adding texture to the fish. Yum! What a nice new way of serving raw fish apart from putting them with vinegar rice! We could choose from 5 main courses - lamb chop was not on the menu - and we picked rib eye and Italian seafood soup.0Apart from that we could also order pastas with either tomato sauce or lobster cream sauce. Fearing of bursting ourselves with food, we only ordered a very small portion of penne in lobster cream sauce for a taste.It was good, the cream sauce was very balanced in favour and not overly heavy, however the penne was slightly overcooked (in my humble opinion) and could have retained a bit of chewiness. It also lacked the texture of durum, not being handmade pastas (okay I admit my palate has been ill-pampered! LOL), but it was good enough and I would have had a few more forkfuls had there been no main courses to follow. I like my choice of main course as I love seafood. What's fresher than a soup base cooked with different kinds of fresh seafood?They had not been overcooked either, as I happily consumed a spoonful of soup followed by a big bite of chewy seafoods. It was the best indulgence I could have imagined. The grilled rib eye was not as great however, as it was slightly overcooked. What a way of wasting a good piece of beef! The texture of the meat was not too fine as well, and we concluded that Bella Vita might be more skilled in serving jewels from the sea than gifts on earth. 0Last but not least was dessert time - I was thrilled to see the once-empty white table now filled with all kinds of desserts: from tiramisu to berry tart, from chocolate cake to apple cake, the dessert corner was a delight to see. However, the taste of it further confirmed our conclusion on Bella Vita's strength on seafood but not other ingredients!The mango napoleon looked decent but it turned soggy having absorbed the moist from the custard, they must have brushed no butter or whatsoever to keep away the moist.The pastry crust of the lemon tart and berries tart were soggy and blah; the meringue was melting halfway and tasted awful. Even the chocolate cake was not 'rich' but pretty plastic in taste.The Chocolate Profiteroles were also melting under the sun; droplets appeared on the chocolate coating and it looked awful.The tiramisu was the most normal among all perhaps, but it was too eggy and not 'alcoholic' enough! I didn't expect the desserts to be THIS bad that it nearly ruined my splendid brunch experience at Bella Vita. Luckily, I couldn't save much room for desserts anyway (the seafood was too good to be missed!), so it wasn't much of a let-down anyway. I as usual ended my meal with hot mint tea, partly to help digestion and partly to help wake myself from the alcohol i consumed.All in all, it was a great place to brunch at, given that you love seafood as much as I do. But if you were a sweet tooth and defines the beauty of life by the amount and quality of sugar you consume, be read to be disappointed."", 'Had a last minute booking for lunch with my friend today.

I tried really hard to look for something which didn't include the buffet, but I wasn't able to. As such, it would be nice if the restaurant could maybe think of some options for people who come for lunch but do not want to eat that much (aka the buffet). Anyway, I did actually wind up eating the buffet, and it was pretty good. They have stuff like sesame chicken, poke style tuna (raw), cucumber salad, papaya salad, sun dried tomatoes... quite a big selection! You can pair your buffet with a steak or something like that, but I think it's just too much food. I tried some of the chicken steak, which was quite decent as well.

Since we were running out of time, we rushed straight into the lifts.  My friend suggested Japanese food, fed up with the meals we had, we quickly closed the doors of the lift and moved on to the second floor.What we seeThe environment was pleasing and modern, with a bit of retro black n white style (honestly I don\'t quite like black n white) Black n white0Black n whiteThe restaurant was quite packed during lunch hour (okay thats pretty normal?)  We waited for a couple of minutes at the entrance and we were brought to our table, we thought the service was fine Since we had a look at the menu during our wait, we quickly ordered our lunch.What we orderThe lunch menu offers a variety of food (ofcourse not as broad as the you would expect on a ""HK style Cha Chan Teng"")  Just a general idea of what they serve: steak, pasta, risotto, pizza, the normal kind of food you would expect to be on a western menu.  As you would see, they serve risotto, I\'m not entirely sure whether you would categorise that as Australian/American cuisine (as you would note in the info box on Openrice).The gentleman who took our orders was very tall and handsome, you don\'t expect to see such man in a restaurant, brilliant (the ""Gentleman""). The Gentleman clearly has good memory, we spelled out our orders and food, soup, etc so quickly that even I can\'t remember what exactly I have ordered but he delivered the food without a single mistake.  well done mate! For the Apps, we were given the choice of a salad or soup of the day, and ofcourse we asked what the soup and salad is.  The Gentleman responded the soup of the day being seafood soup (he didn\'t specify what seafood soup, and if im not wrong, lobster bisque and a clam chowder tastes a bit different) and salad......... (and this is a direct quote from the gentleman) ""is just some salad"" he said, as well as laughed.I\'m sorry but it appears to me the Gentleman simply didn\'t know/care about their own menu. What we tastewarm0warmWarm bread was served with salted butter, I would say, fair.Yet no plates were given for our bread, leaving bread crumbs on the table, perhaps this is their style?  I saw them sweeping bread crumbs off each table after diners left, what is the point... but who cares when the bread was nice and warm! interesting0interestingSoup arrived and before we were being served, we were told the ""seafood soup"" had been sold out, and the waiter offered an alternative, we were left with little (if any) choice and a cream vegetable soup was then placed in front of us.as usual0as usualAs usual, my mate chucked her leftover bread next to my soup for photo, I have absolutely no idea why she kept doing that, it doesn\'t help much with writing a perfect food review does it?  So, dear respectful Editor, please ignore this photo.The vegetable soup tastes milky and creamy but slightly watery.  I can taste broccoli in the soup, i mean the taste was alright, but it would be better if it isn\'t that diluted.  odd0oddMy learned friend did complain about the lack of correct cutleries, she asked if that was for the soup.

Mussels and scallop with pumpkin risottoLasagneLasagne0LasagneMy learned friend said it was cooked nicely, rich and a bit filling for her.  Salmon fettucini in cream sauceFettucini0FettuciniIsn\'t it beautiful the fettucini?  However my learned friend (literally) refused to comment on the dish (due to the incident stated below).Mussels and scallop with pumpkin risottoRisotto0RisottoRisotto was perfectly cooked, the pumpkin sauce was not too sweet but just right, the sweetness brings out the freshness of the scallops, it was brilliant.  However, not so brilliant were the mussels, I can see they were seasoned with pepper and spices but not evenly, resulting in two out of the three tasted a bit fishy, what a pity.   Although cherry tomatoes doesn\'t really match with the dish, I liked it.Risotto normally doesn\'t come in a big portion, but look at the picture..!  I was very full after the lunch!Tea and coffee followed, we ordered iced lemon tea and syrup served separately What we thinkI mean, honestly, I think its a fair lunch, the food certainly meet the standards but there are rooms for improvement.

We were offered the bar stool next to two other people which was fine for us but the other people left, possibly due to the lack of space (we would have been elbow to elbow). We were quickly presented with a menu whose quality resembles something you would hand out on the streets for marketing purposes. It's like a self serve place where u go up to the counter, order and pay first. My friend and I opted for the half combo of short rib. We were given the option of pretzel bun, a kind of wrap or rice. We opted for the first. The combo also comes with a side and a drink. We got nachos and beetroot fries. For drinks, there was no list on the menu and the lady at the counter listed out the options when asked at a very rapid pace. We went for the iced lemon tea. 0The food was surprisingly very small in portion for the price paid ($108 each). BOTH our main with sides fit in a single serving tray so that should give you a clearer picture.

Beetroot fries0Beetroot friesBeetroot fries were quote oily but its fries. I thoroughly enjoyed the sauce it cams with. The nachos was ok, no complaint. However for the price,  one can definitely have better quality and quantity food and also at a place with better ambiance. p.s. the half ribs (and combo option) is only offered from 12-3; I also read reviews of this place from a year ago and it appears that they had a larger range of burgers (we were told that there is only one kind of burger offered now) which was very disappointing as I had initially choosen to dine here to try their burgers.

The waiters were friendly and casual, they greeted customers well and were helpful. Food gets ordered at the cashier and the girl at the cashier knew the menu well enough to make recommendations and suggestions for making combos (to save you $). Nice!They have funky burger ingredients like kimchi, bak choi... So both times I ordered ""vintage"" (which is more ""normal""), added $15 for an extra piece of SPAM ham which was proven to be a good decision! The beef was juicy and tender, the cheese melted just right, saltiness was just right, and it doesn\'t give you the """" after-taste that most burgers have. The problem with adding SPAM was only that the wrapping paper was a bit too small for the thickness and got messy, but taste-wise everything was great! I also ordered Beet Fries, it comes with mayo with cajun, the first time the fries was perfect, very soft, sweet and juicy in the centre and crispy outside!! The second time the fries was slightly too dry because the cut was too small and it got slightly burnt.The only thing I would complain about is the drinks. A can of regular coke costs $25 (!!) without combo, while a can of Arizona Green Tea costs $40 (!!). So probably you will be better off not drinking there if your favourite burger is not the ""combo burger of the day"" (each day only 2 burger/wrap can be part of a combo).I\'ll definitely be a regular for weekday lunch here but have to sort out the drinks part to lower my lunch expense...

Their portions might looked pretty small, but it was denitely enough to fill the stomaches of two women with a much larger appetite than an average Hong Kong lady. We both picked something from the Boom Burger menu, rather than tacos. I had the Holy Kimchi (HKD$88) and loved it. The corned beef and kimchi pairing was interesting. The beef was succulent andthekimchi was flavourful (not spicy). Cheddar cheese and their 'baconaise' (bacon + mayo?) provided the grease that held the burger together wonderfully. All their bugers were served in potato buns. I assume it was made with potato powder and flour, with texture similar to a focaccia,and it has more air pockets than the usual flour bun, which means it can hold more sauce and juice from the meat! It was a very nice combination. 0Holy Kimchi$ 880Holy Kimchi$ 88My friend had the King Kong (HKD$ 98) which had a beef patty and a spam patty, along with bok choy, provolone and XO sauce mayo. You can smell the bok choy when you opened the box that held the burger. The burger was bursting with juice, and my friend didn't appreciate it as it made a whole mess and her precious engagement ring was soaked in the grubby grease (that was a hilarious scene when she panicked ...). The XO sauce was barely detectable and there were simply too much meat and too little bun. I guess the King Kong would be something for the macho macho man.

This is why:Expensive: Having researched the place on Open Rice I had reason to believe that this was not an overpriced restaurant, as the price shown was 'Below $50'.

This price obviously did not turn me away, as a high quality burger is worth its weight in gold, which brings us to...Size: My Kimchi burger, if you're even allowed to call it that, was tiny -- the burger was smaller than my fist which is far from the massive burgers you see in the pictures. I actually had to get another meal after finishing lunch, which made todays lunch even more disappointing. Well sometimes you have to judge food by quality over quantity, which brings us to...Quality: Even though the size of the burger was a complete letdown I was still excited to finish the burger and try the (seemingly) delicious Kimchi/Burger combination. Unfortunately there was no real kimchi taste, which is a letdown because that was the main reason I tried the damn burger in the first place. Moreover, there was no beef patty on my burger (maybe my mistake in assuming that there would be?) which essentially means that I paid ~100 dollars for a 'Tiny Kimchi Sandwich' -- this name would give customers a better understanding of what they are paying for.At least the staff was friendly.

And the name has circus in it. It makes you think ... can this place really give me a good burger? There are many times I wanted to give this place a try but boyfriend said can you really believe a good burger would come from a place with so many gimmicks?I nodded. He's probably right.Then I saw a blog mention that they were giving away a free cheeseburger one weekend. I showed boyfriend. And we headed out for lunch!The promotion was to test out their new and improved cheeseburger. What the old one tasted, I have no idea. But this was the new and improved version. It was for dine in only so we sat down. Glad we arrived early as it started to fill up with people wanting a free burger. Menu is in English only.0We ordered the two cheeseburgers ($98 but it was free for the promotion) and shared a set of onion rings ($38). The cheeseburger was pretty good. It wasn't great as a higher end burger but for a fast food style burger, it was pretty good. It checked off all the boxes. A decent patty that was a bit dry but filled in with the sauce it was slathered with. A crunchy bit of onion and a slice of processed cheese. A good fast food burger. But for the price tag of $98, one shouldn't be happy with a fast food burger. But it wasn't terrible and would tempt me to return again. The onion rings were over fried and way too much coating. I've had better onion rings elsewhere. But the price wasn't fairly reasonable.0I saw they had a Halloween milkshake and since I love to try as many Halloween related items as possible, I ordered this. It costs $78. When I asked the waiter what was in it, he seemed a bit vague. He said there was cake and nerds, eye and tongue. When it arrived, it looked like something a pre-school art project. The eyes and teeth were hard gummy candies. The tongue was a long sour gummy. The milkshake was probably one of the worst I've had. It was just blended cream. It was just watery and not thick at all. I don't think they used ice cream? There were a mouthful of nerd but where was the cake? For $78, this is definitely not worth your time. You get a better milkshake at Triple Os for cheaper.0The burger was pretty good. Definitely steer clear of the milkshake. I'd be back."", 'We went for a simple burger and fries at Burger Circus.

The burger and fries took a bit of a wait. I liked the cheddar cheese in the burger which is nicely melted. The beef patty was well done but very moist so it's perfect for a preggo woman like me. The sauce was also very good with a tangy flavour - so it'snot just ketchup. Same problem with a lot of the comments here is the wateryrunny saucedripping from the bottom of the burger -which can simply beavoided when the veggies are patteddry before putting into the bun. Fries werecrispy enough for me. No complaintson the food.For the price I paid, I think I got something better than Burger King but definitely not Butcher's Club quality. Will not come back for the food. Probably back for the atmospherewhich is very suitable forsocial gatheringandgood to chill in a60s diner kind of environment."", ""I went to Burger Circus after seeing photos of it on a HK restaurant instagram. It was just as good as I had expected! The restaurant was really easy to get to (close to Queens Road Central) so it only took us a few minutes to walk there. It was about 1.15pm but luckily there was no queue so we were seated right away. We had to share a table with a couple but it was fine, as the table was big enough that it wasn't awkward and we could still have a private conversation. The decor of the restaurant was great- they had little diner like booths to sit in, a bar seating ares, and candy in jars lining the bar- it was very well done. Our waiter was very polite and came to us quickly so we didn't have to wait for very long, and was very helpful in advising us on which sodas and burgers were better suited for us. I ordered an Ameican Acrobat burger (5oz beef patty, lettuce, tomato, cheese, and Mayo) with thick cut fries and a Passion fruit Pineapple soda (homemade!) and my friend got the Flame Thrower Burger. They came quite quickly and were delicious. The burger wasn't too greasy but was very juicy and well seasoned. The fried were great as well, and there was ketchup available to use on every table. I loved my soda as well- it was fizzy, fruity, and sweet. My friend said that she enjoyed her burger too.Overall I loved having lunch here. The bill cost $297 for both of us, but was worth it. The milkshakes they offered also looked enticing but I was too full! Definitely recommend if you want a bite to eat that is great, reasonably priced, and conveniently located, with good staff.Flamethrower Burger (top) and American Acrobat Burger (bottom)...1Flamethrower Burger (top) and American Acrobat Burger (bottom)...Burgers with Soda1Burgers with SodaSupplementary Informationservice charge: yesair con: yeswifi: don't think so"", ""What better place for a US style burger joint than Hollywood Road? I'd walked past Burger Circus a heap of times while exploring Soho, but it had always been super busy, with queues down the street. I've never been one for queuing, so I'd just keep walking by. It would take planning to get in to test out these burgers, and judging by the queues, I was anticipating a superior burger (no pressure!).Designed to resemble a train carriage, Burger Circus plays homage to the original American diners which often operated out of abandoned railway cars and were sometimes open twenty four hours a day, seven days a week. Not quite open 24/7, Burger Circus plies its trade in freshly ground burgers, all American Sandwiches and traditional deserts from 12pm until late. So, we'd planned our morning around hitting the joint around 12 to ensure we didn't have to wait.It was a good thing too, we were standing out the front of the Hollywood Road burger joint shortly after 12 and most of the seats were already taken. In fact, our only option was to sit at the bar counter, which actually suited us better, we could get a first had view of Burger Circus in action. Unlike some of the other burger joints around HK, where there is a limited menu, the Burger Circus menu is action packed, with a heap of burgers, sides, sandwiches and a pretty extensive drinks selection. 0SC wasn't feeling to well, so opted out of a burger and ordered straight from the dessert menu. I thought for my first burger, I'd try the Circus Classic, which comprised of a 5oz beef patty with lettuce, tomato and Circus sauce. The simple sounding burger was actually perfect for someone like me, I love the simple classics and this had all the markings of being a beauty. It was presented old school style, in a cardboard box and standing upright. I could see it was paced with lettuce and tomato but the patty didn't seem that thick, so I wondered how it would be cooked medium as requested. My first bite answered all my questions and more. It was a revelation! The fresh ground meat patty was juicy and a perfect medium and the fresh lettuce and tomato seemed a perfect match. The circus sauce was incredibly, slightly sweet, it wasn't overpowering and really enhanced the burger. I liked it, I liked it a lot.2 1Shortly after my burger came out, my salted caramel milkshake was delivered. I'd probably have preferred it before the burger, so the timing was a little out. Timing aside, it was a monster of a drink, thick caramel milkshake in a traditional tall glass, topped with whipped cream - it even had a cherry on top! There was a sprinkling of salt on the cream, which was a little odd but made more sense once I mixed the concoction together. Ahhh, salted caramel goodness.0After quite some wait, we needed to ask for SC's banana split. All was forgiven when the simply amazing looking banana split was presented. Talk about tradition, this could have come out of the 1950's and been transported to the 21st century (no, time travel has still not been invented - I think?). Lots of beautiful ice cream inside a split banana and covered in whipped cream, with cherries on top. It was drool worthy, but instead of drool, SC just got stuck into it and smiled the whole time.1 I really loved my Burger Circus experience, in particular that Circus Classic, which had everything I could want in a burger (that is, it didn't come standard with pickles). The problem was, I wanted another straight after, and then again that same night for dinner. In fact we walked by around 7:30pm to get another, but the queue was too long, so we grabbed pizza instead.Yeah, I'll be back to Burger Circus, namely because it's right on the way home from work, but also because the burgers are spectacular. It's a cool little spot, with emphasis on little - Burger Circus only has about a dozen tables and fills up pretty quickly (although it also turns over pretty quickly). I reckon they could have had a space twice the size and I'm betting it won't be long before a second spot opens up.Actually, I think I might have to wander down tonight for dinner.0001010Supplementary InformationGet there early otherwise you could be waiting for a while""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-burger-circus/436353?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

The concept itself is undeniably simple,yet when executed properly, a humble hamburger is a gorgeous thing. It should have a medium/medium-rare patty; a tart sauce; pickles to cut through the richness of the beef; gooey grilled cheese; and fresh vegetables for a touch of crispness. As long as you got those bases covered, your burger is good to go. Anything more will simply obstruct it's natural beauty. However, the motto 'simple is best' does not apply to Hong Kong. Restaurants here suffer from acompulsive need to constantly change or 'upgrade' classics that are fundamentally perfect, like the good ol' burger. Sometimes innovation works, as evident from the fantastic burgers at Butcher Club (oh the wu-tang) and the sorely missed Double D's'; but often times, innovation does not add anything to the dish and you end up wishing you were served the original. Here in Burger Home, this was sadly the case.Soft Melted Cheese Burger$ 520Soft Melted Cheese Burger$ 52Burger Home is a small burger restaurant located in the back alleys of Wanchai. It is popular amongst Wanchaioffice workers and attendants of the church nearby (in fact, it was a pastor who told me about this place during asermon) for it's #foodporn worthy burgers where the cheese is stuffed and cooked inside the patty. While themolten oozing cheese does create a bit of a spectacle, it also brings forth problems for the burger. In order to stopthe cheese from seeping out while cooking, Burger Home's patty is extremely tight. When cooked, this tightlypacked patty becomes dense and hard. It lacked the succulence found in a great burger patty, and was chewy rather than melting. The beef was also a bit too lean for my liking.Another issue with the whole 'cheese inside the burger thing' is that it makes the cheese taste one dimensional. By putting a slice of cheese on top of the patty, then flipping it so it comes into direct contact with the stove, the cheese mops up the caramelised beef juices which provides it with another level of flavour and oomph. Here, you get athick, bright orange liquid inside your burger that strangely tastes of the nacho cheese sauce served in cinemas.Whilethe burger does have a second piece of cheese on top of the patty, it was not properly melted and tastedlifeless,likeit came from a packet. There were also issues with the bun and the sauce. The bun was crumbly, and after a few bites, fell apart into pieces and created a bit of a soggy mess. The sauce was sickly sweet and failed toprovide thesharpness craved by a burger with a dense patty and two portions of cheese. The whole thing was tooheavy, too cloying, too dense, and I wish I was served a simple, well-executed original instead.There are positives, the patty, despite it's shortcomings, tasted nice and remained juicy. Adding onions gave itanother flavour and textural dimension. Prices are also reasonable, as you get a generous-sized melted cheese burger for HK$52 (cheaper options begin at HK$37). The staff also deserves a special shoutout. They were attentive, friendly and tried their damnedest to fit everyone in the tiny store. Here's the thing. I really want to like Burger Home. I love seeing individual stores seeking to provide better, healthier and tastier alternatives to the garbage served atthe large multinational fast-food chains that pollute Hong Kong's culinary landscape (I do have a soft spot forJollibee'sthough), especially when they do not charge cut-throat prices. Unfortunately, restaurants must be judged by the taste of their food, and Burger Home's burgers did not taste very nice.                Supplementary InformationFor more reviews on Hong Kong's restaurants, please visit wongeatshongkong.wordpress.com"", ""tastes better than the picture suggests0tastes better than the picture suggestsI like this place a lot. The bun is significantly softer than a typical burger bun, especially as it lacks sesame seeds, but the texture all comes together well. The burger is soft too, and the whole things blends. The patties taste fresh; maybe because the beef is less finely minced, so it feels less processed.The fries are also good. They're slightly textured (more so than most fries), so the hold more flavour than average, in the same cooking time, so they're still soft and fluffy inside.Overall, recommended.P.S. I've had the chicken burger and the pork burger before, and would NOT recommend either (very greasy/slimy).""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/wan-chai-burger-home/534939?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

Overall I think this is the Best little burger place in Hong Kong, I will return, and I found out they are open late.  Double Cheese Burger0Double Cheese Burger"", ""0I'm always on the lookout for a new burger joint and moving to Wanchai has certainly opened up a few more options.I'd been noticing posters all over the place advertising a place called Burger Joys, so set about tracking it down for a spot of lunch.Wanchai is an interesting location, it's got a wide variety of dining options that range from three Michelin Starred fine dining restaurants, hip and happening 'now' spots, as well as down and dirty grungy bar cum restaurants. We'd moved away from the glamorous end of Wanchai to the much seedier side, where the nightlife runs from seedy bars to strip clubs. Burger Joys finds itself right in the middle of the Wanchai red light district, which is pretty benign during the day and pretty darn racy in the evening.I was pretty surprised by how small Burger Joys actually was, expecting something a little bigger than the 'almost' hole in the wall diner on Lockhart Road. Small as it was, there was still room for a half dozen or so tables to be crammed around the serving area, which looked very much as if it doubled as a bar once the sun went down. We'd arrived for a Saturday lunch and the place was pretty empty, so we had no trouble finding a table which surprisingly was managed by table service.0We decided to keep it pretty simple for our first experience at Burger Joys, I'd gone for the signature double cheese burger and the girl had chosen the single cheeseburger with bacon added. Of course we added fries to the order, my choice being the black truffle fries and SC choosing the sweet potato variety. I finished off the order with a vanilla milkshake.First out were our fries, which came in cardboard boxes with the Burger Joys logo plastered clearly on the side. My first impression of the fries was positive, the golden potato fries smelling divine with flecks of black truffle. The crunchy thin cut fries were superb, with a crisp golden outer and fluffy potato inside and they made a satisfying crunch as I shovelled them into my mouth. There was a nice level of seasoning but the real highlight was the subtle truffle taste that sat at the back of the palate and ensured the fries were addictive.0I've never been a fan of sweet potato but proceeded to have a taste of the slightly orange, yet equally golden fries. Yep, I'm just not a fan, but it didn't matter because SC was happily munching away and assuring me that the Burger Joys sweet potato fries were just wonderful. Meh, I was pretty happy to leave them to the girl and keep on munching my black truffle fries.0Once the burger arrived, I quickly forgot about the fries and started to salivate at the prospect of tucking into my wonderful and perfectly formed double cheese burger. I mean it was a thing of beauty! Perfectly in proportion, the soft buns surrounding the double patties made from 100% USDA beef that were held together by the gooey melted butter. Fresh tomato, lettuce and Spanish onion finished off the burger, leaving the magic ratio of ingredients in complete harmony.1My first bite was a little magical, the soft bun yielding easily to my razor sharp chompers and the strong flavour of beef and cheese. As good as that first bite was, the rest of the burger just didn't quite maintain and a couple of elements started in intrude on my burger buzz. First thing was the texture, it was just a little too soft overall and really could have used something a little firmer to help. The cheese also quickly became overpowering, leading to an overly salty and greasy feeling. I got just over halfway through before the saltiness got too overwhelming and I had to stop.0The girl's cheeseburger with bacon actually helped eradicate one of my issues around texture, the tasty bacon giving extra chew to the experience. However, SC experienced the same overly salty and greasy taste from the cheese in her cheeseburger, it was great to start with but just became too much over the course of the burger.0I also had a little issue with the timing of our order, in particular my vanilla milkshake. It became pretty clear when I was halfway through my burger that they'd forgotten the shake and I had to ask after my drink. After a sheepish look, the counter staff got onto the shake pretty quickly and I have to admit that the whipped cream with a red cherry on top really added to a pretty decent shake.1There are some pretty good burger joints around Hong Kong and I think that Burger Joys has the potential to be great. I'd probably not order a cheese burger in future, but the beef patties were nice and the signature bun was as good as you'd hope to see with a burger. In fact, Burger Joys have really bet the house on their buns, enlisting decorated French pastry chef Michael Gillet to design the bun.Melted cheese is one my favourite things in the world, when amazing cheese is used, so I was disappointed with the cheese aspect of my burger. I'm not sure why, but it just threw out the balance of the burger and really stopped me from loving my choice.I'll definitely be back to Burger Joys, although next time I just grab the standard burger and skip the cheese.@FoodMeUpScotty0Plenty of boozy options as befitting a spot in seedy Wanchai0Quiet during the day - but the place is packed on a Saturday night 0Later the same night - crowds spilling onto the street"", ""Thanks to OpenSnap, I received free tickets to see Spotlight, the movie, and it just happened that the day I was free to go see the movie, it was St. Patrick's Day.

The shocking reality is that it turned out to be nothing special at all, in fact the customer service was awful which made our experience even worse.

I'd rather eat Triple O any day of the week than come here again."", ""Burgeroom in Causeway Bay is a classic example of an overrated burger joint that serves nothing up but mediocrity. To even call it a 'burger' joint would be giving this place a bit too much credit because it pales in comparison to other genuine restaurants that are committed to delivering the best burgers in town. First, of all the restaurant itself doesn't have any unique decoror anything that would grab your attention. It is rather small making the seating arrangements very uncomfortable. Better get used to the most boring conversations around you. Perhaps the thing that pissed me off the most during my dining experience there was the lack of professionalism the staff seem to show. I usually don't care too much when staff are rude or dismissive because I understand they are busy and stressed half the time, but when we dined here on a pretty chill Saturday, I couldn't help but think how blunt and irreverent they were as though we were Mainlanders.We ordered the Double Cheeseburger Combo to try. It took roughly 15 minutes to come which is okay but could have been faster given the lack of orders at that time. Whilst the burger stood firm, there was nothing really visually appealing about it. In fact, it just looked like one of those sloppy seconds you get after a night out in the town. Half the time your drunk so you just eat what you're given. That was what the Double Cheeseburger reminded me of.The flavour of the burger was byfar the most uninteresting aspect. It was average at best and had no grilled beef flavor. It felt like something that got nuked in the microwave before it got served to customers like the food shown in the Ramsay Kitchen Nightmare episodes. If I didn't order it, I would've thought it was pork. Tomatoes were cold, lettuce was sparingly given and buns were not buttered and grilled to the appropriate texture. The burger itself was also just about warm. Chips were okay, but onlyhad the proportion size from an Oliver Twist tale. I was unaware Hong Kong was facing a potato famine at the time but Burgeroom was certainly rationing for it.Overall if you have some spare time in Hong Kong and are dyingto know what disappointment and incompetencyfeels like, the Burgeroom does so with ease.

I dreamt of a super juicy burger, lots of oozing cheese and a lovely toasted bun. And got the opposite. The burger was an average patty. Same as Golden Arches. The cheese was basically melted cheese slice and the bun was floppy and tasteless. Whatever this place has done to win awards escapes me. Go to Mos or Maccy D and save yourself 50 bucks a pop. Or try a proper burger place like  electric avenue or beef and liberty. Adding insult to injury is the ordering before you eat routine which makes this place resemble even more the land of Golden Arches.', ""Since there are not many choices in Kowloon tong, my colleagues and I travelled to Prince Edward for lunch This is the second time I visit hami harmony, I ordered  with soup.The soup looks delicious, but it was a bit salty and oily. I preferred the one made by my dad 0the main dish was yummy, it looks a bit little.

BROWNED BUT NOT BURNED and then the SOFTER FAT IN THE MIDDLE/INSIDE  - perfecto !! (at least that\'s how I like it)For me the Foie Gras was the STAR ingredient of this burger .The Beef patty was well done and the foie gras and cheddar cheese went quite well with it.This very same Burger is available in another variant - with double the pieces of foie gras.... in hindsight, I think I should\'ve taken that one.... anyway maybe I can do that next week! Chilli Mushroom Chicken Burger0Chilli Mushroom Chicken BurgerThe CHILLI MUSHROOM CHICKEN BURGER-Generous quantity of chicken and coleslaw .... can\'t really go wrong with this combination and it was also good.... perhaps the chicken was (very) slightly on the CHEWY side but overall it was still pretty good.I still have to try the many-many SEAFOOD BURGERS on the menu....as well as the many other beef and chicken burgers.... it\'s definitely gonna take a while to finish trying all of them .1', ""I'm usually not a big fan of burgers but honestly, bugeroom made me rethink about my life decisions. I ordered their foie gras beef burger and really that was the last I was completely sure pizzas were my fave. I took the first massive chunk and WAW, I felt like clouded nines! The flavours were absolutely harmonised with the rich beef being so deliciously tender with juices spilling out, the tomatoes and lettuce giving a nice balance to cool your heating tongue down, their homemade sauce form a delicious undertone to the components and don't get me started with the foie gras. Well, I'm gonna say it anyways. It was an absolute delicacy, giving a luxurious touch to the burger. It gave a rich almost beefy taste, soft and literally melts in your mouth within seconds of contact. An absolute goodness which unifies all the components of the burger.

Struggling to come up with a place to have lunch, we decided to be spontaneous and walked through the restaurants on Fashion Walk. Burgers seemed like a great idea so we settled for the first restaurant on our wayBurgeroom.The price range is pretty bigyou can go from $70 for a simple Classic with just a beef patty to high $200s with lobster. I would have gone for the lobster if it was a surf and turfwith both beef and lobster, but as it turns out lobster burger is essentially lobster roll but in a burger bun. I really wanted beef so decided to just go for Classic. You can top up your burger with extra cheddar, Portobello, bacon and all kinds of things. I didnt go for the meal combo (which gives you their thick fries and a drink) but instead ordered a Portobello salad ($65ish).The salad was a surprise. Although it only consisted of iceberg lettuce and frisee, a few strips of red onion and three slices of beefsteak tomatoes, they used a yuzu-based vinaigrette so it was refreshing. Personally would have preferred the salad to be less greasy but both my friend and I agreed that it was pretty nice overall. The Portobello that came with it might have been dumped in the oil tank for deep-fry, but it was topped with tiny tomato dices to give it a light touch.Onto the burgerThe beef patty must have been made in-house. The texture was good, but overall I would give it a 2.5/5 because it was not juicy and didnt taste too much like beef. I like to see juice oozing out as I slice through my beef patties. As Burgeroom has a rather good reputation, I wonder if we have just been unlucky. Slightly disappointed but as we were hungry we were happy anyway, especially as we had a nice salad.The burger joint is self-serviced and you have to order and pay at the till, and grab your own utensils and tissue papers and everything else at a small desk just next to the entrance. They serve burgers in KFC-style baskets with grease paper and so its not very easy to have the burger with a knife and fork. The seats are not meant to be too comfortable and the tables must have measured less than 50cm on each side! So this is definitely not a very comfortable place if youre looking to spend a whole afternoon chatting with friends, but for a quick burger this is definitely okay.

We ate immediately after serving. The pizza had super thin and crispy crust. There were loads of toppings but not over. Despite the presence of so much cheese, the flavour was great, not too salty at all. The cheese was so ductile while eating. Really quite a good pizza indeed. Highly recommended. And please note the price of $190+10% which was really not too pricey given the quality and location.Then let's talk about the lunch sets. Here you go the appetizers:White Asparagus with Culatello Ham and Orange Dressing...1White Asparagus with Culatello Ham and Orange Dressing...White Asparagus with Culatello Ham and Orange DressingVery fresh ingredients. The asparagus were ok although they could have been even more tender. They were warm, to my surprise. The Culatello Ham, one of the most prized salumi in Italy, was super fresh and good.

Quite a good appetizer after all.Black Rice Salad with Tomato Emulsion and Smoked Stracciatella Cheese...0Black Rice Salad with Tomato Emulsion and Smoked Stracciatella Cheese...Black Rice Salad with Tomato Emulsion and Smoked Stracciatella CheeseInteresting black rice which were not so starchy and a little bit chewy.

Quite al dente although I had expected even more al dente texture. The sauce was ok too, quite creamy but not so cheesy! The minced sausages were really bad! Tasteless like frozen pork and so rough. The mushrooms couldn't help. Very Very bad minced sausages which had ruined the whole dish. Even Chinese-style steamed minced pork was better.

FYI they hadn't asked how well done we would like it to be cooked. I think it could have been more cooked in my humble opinion. The crust was good though.

Last time it was so freshly baked, crispy and juicy. This time Norcina seemed so dry while the sausage and mushrooms were nothing special. Estiva was better as it was less dry with the cherry tomato and rocket but the Parma ham was a bit too salty. The crust was not so crispy and much less freshly baked like before. I was so disappointed.Pan Fried Red Snapper with Bell Pepper Sauce and Baby Corn...1Pan Fried Red Snapper with Bell Pepper Sauce and Baby Corn...The red snapper was so dry and rough, maybe a problem of pan-frying?

Pan fried cod fish with cherry tomatoes, fettuccine with king prawns and tomato as well as lamb chops. This is pretty much the same menu we had in our previous visits. Complacency?Bread was OK but slightly on the hard side.0For starter, I went with their parma ham with Sicilian melon. Are the melons sweeter on the other side of the world?

The pizza had a soggy base, chewy but tasteless cheese and lots of grease at the bottom. The pasta dishes were not even hot but only room temperature which makes any dish difficult to please.

Unbelievable, considering that the dessert is actually only a brownie, and it was the only dessert option on the set lunch menu that required someadvance prep...my point is, entertaining our cancellation was unlikely to have resulted in food wastage, which I am pretty anal about.

I would even go so far as to say that tasted quite stale. Served hot, with no condiments.

Mushroom soup  Mushroom soup - bland, watery..oil and water don't mix well either...0Mushroom soup - bland, watery..oil and water don't mix well either...It even looks bad. I'm biased I think, after tasting it. S left almost half a bowl untouched. Really, it wasn't an overstatement.

A skimpy argula salad and a bit of baked potato sat on either side. There was no horseradish or specialty mustard which I was expecting.

Now this was really amazing. I had asked the waiter earlier whether he would recommend the fish or the pasta. Glad he recommended the latter. It was...as good as the pasta over at 8 1/2.  I'm actually not a big fan of homemade pastas because they tend to be quite limp, but this one was al dente, and the sauce was delicious. I picked out the prawns for S but they did contribute to the flavour profile of the sauce. Ahh, I'm still thinking about the sauce!  The sauce wasn't thick but evenly coated every single strand of fettuccine. Not a single strand was left uncoated. So down to the very last forkful, this dish was a delight to my senses. Since the sauce is not cream-based, I didn't feel sickly aftewards. It is a light, flavourful and clingy tomato-based sauce. Yumyum. The balance between pasta and other ingredients was just right. I finished everything simultaneously - no loose strands of pasta orphaned at the end.

I mean, it looked really good and pro, and it was sweet and chocolatey. The hazelnut ice cream was not creamy enough. G makes much better ice cream (why do I keep comparing Ciak's food with a non-professional's food...?) Perhaps it's because the brownie itself is already really rich, and they didn't want the ice cream to add an extra dose of guilt. Oh, and the dark chocolate ganache sandwiched between the ice cream adn the brownie was way too sweet as well. It's a pity that we didn't really have time to enjoy it fully. We devoured it in 2 minutes. Goodbye.                Supplementary InformationOn the whole, the portions were meager and would have left a man feeling slightly underwhelmed after the meal. Guys might prefer a heartier portion of pasta."", ""One occassional afternoon I was strolling past the new Urban Bakery in Landmark, marvelling at the delightful Christmas decorations downstairs, when I looked around I saw a new restaurant open in the space that was previously blocked off after Three Sixty closed. The restaurant is Ciak. Furnished with an organic wooden interior - light birch walls and dark walnut colored furniture; having a spacious, well-lighted dining area; and with the smell of gorgeous cooking wafting through the open kitchen; this cozy new restaurant has the makings of a star.00Whether deliberate or not, it is refreshing to see Ciak bring back the supermarket hertitage of the space in the form of an Italian grocer plus restuarant. More exciting still is the involvement of Umberto Bombana, of Otto e Mezzo BOMBANA and Toscana fame, as chef and culinary advisory.My first visit was on a weekday afternoon, booked by my friend right after I saw it. The restaurant was already buzzing with people when we arrived. The waiters were courteous and seemed to know many of the diners there, which I pressume have just been to the pre-opening. Service was fast and friendly.We both chose from the set menu ($238 each), opting for each a starter and a main.0The classic minestrone soup with pesto sauce I had was an eye-catching hue of green, and seemed too bland on the first few sips. The flavor got progressively better as I reached the bottom of the bowl (or more appropriately, pot). I would say the taste is warm and well-balanced, a good soup for the warmer seasons; but I personally prefer its more hearty traditional version.0The beef tongue with tuna sauce worked well for my friend. The thinly sliced meat was garnished with dollops of creamy tuna and topped with arugula. A healthy starting choice.Wonderful charcoal flavors0Wonderful charcoal flavorsFor the main, mychar-grilled U.S. sirloin steak with argula salad did not disappoint. The characoal flavors from the grill reminded me of the steak I've had at Tango, one of my favorite steakhouses in HK, where you can have the crust blackened and the inside still rare. The meat was tender and juicy, complimented by a tasty gravy and roasted potatoes.Simply amazing pasta1Simply amazing pastaMy favorite dish was the lasagette with homemade sausage mushroom and mozzeralla, which I sampled in large forkfuls of it off my friend's plate. The pasta was cooked al dente and you can still taste the floury scent; my guess is that it is freshly made in store (to verify next visit). The tomato based meat sauce was rich and the pork bits meaty and tender.

I guess due to the location, it's a lot more quiet than the original location.

Set includes a drink, pasta with char siu , scrambled egg and toast. The service is a lot more friendly now. No more of the grumpy staff from the previous store. I found it cute they clipped my receipt in a HUGE wooden clothespin.0Food came super fast. I'm sure I ordered and it came instantly! This is the pasta with char siu. Unlike the usual macaroni in other places, they had spaghetti here. They also offered char siu instead of the canned ham. This I liked a lot more. The char siu was pretty good. Not too fat and yet not dry. The spaghetti was actually al dente! Soup was a clear chicken broth.0The toast was a thick slice of bread and buttered with just the right amount of butter without it feeling oily. The scrambled egg was not over cooked. I noticed the ham was tasty, too. Not that overly salty kind that is found in most places.0Though the food costs a bit more here, the quality was much better. It was quiet and clean.. I'd be back especially as they have bilingual menus. Something that is rare in a cha chan teng.

I always have low expectations when ordering carbonara in Hoing Kong especially from non Western restaurants as it\'s usually just some white sauce with bacon on top of spaghetti.

89,Caffe Kenon & Bistro,Wan Chai,Italian,3.0,55.0,0.0,"Mid June (Rainy)I was not feeling too hungry that afternoon, but i was desperate for a place to stay for an hour or two before i departed for my next destination. The heavy rain stopped me from searching for a better place than Caffe Kenon in this part of Wanchai - you could not move around for even an inch under that sort of heavy rain.Anyway, the place was not exactly crowded even though it was during lunchtime when i arrived. Still, as I was planning to stay for an hour or two, I felt an urge to order more than just a coffee. A salad, a fruit platter, or whatever. Just anything to go with my coffee so that i look less odd. Searchin through the menu, the least satisfying item I spotted was the 'soup of the day'. I asked what it was and turned out to be cream of pumpkin soup. Fine it was so i took one to go with my espresso macchiato.0The wait was short and brief before my meal arrived. The espresso macchiato came in a small cup, of course, but i hated how the dish underneath was sorta irregular in shape - it took up a lot of space on my little table. 0The little foamed milk on top of the espresso (which 'tainted' the espresso, if i am correct - that's why we call it macchiato) was quite nicely foamed, and the crema of the espresso was pretty thick, but i really dislike the TASTE of the espresso. It was a little too sour for me - i would prefer something more mild.0 The cream of pumpkin soup came with two pieces of toasted, sliced baguette. The soup was pretty watery, vaguely resembling the heartless 'soup' chaa chen tengs serve with their lunch super-combos, and there was basically little flavour of the pumpkin, not to mention flesh or flakes of the vegetable. It was just so-so, and I was glad that I did not actually planned to eat it for lunch - a waste of quota it would be.Even the pieces of bread were bad. They were over-toasted and became stone-hard. A dip into the soup wouldnt help. You couldnt even spread the butter on it as they were too hard (for an unknown reason, I could not spread the butter. BELIEVE ME.). But the environment of the cafe was pretty nice and cosy even though it grew quite noisy during lunch.I should have searched for someplace else than this had the sky been brighter without heavy downpours...or perhaps its just not my cup of coffee."", 'I had the lunch set: braised chicken in pumpkin sauce, with rice and a coffee, for $52 (+10%).At first glance, I thought the portion size was a little smaller than it had looked on the menu, but not too bad.The chicken was very fresh and clean; there was no skin or oil, and it tasted very light.

Today, my friend and I were in wan chai and we finally had chance to come here.We arrived at 12:20.  We found that it provides lunch sets which includes a main dish with the basic coffee, either cappuccino or latte.  As those special coffee on the drink menu are so attractive, we decided to make separate order.Being chocolate lovers, we have ordered paspuccio and pas-ciock . For food, we wanted to try the mushroom sauce and therefore we ordered a sandwiches called ""Roma"" (which has mushroom sauce with ham, tomatoes and salad) and the ravioli . Paspuccio came first, the pattern was so nice.  After a few minutes, the waiteress came and said they have no chocolate, so we couldn\'t choose any drinks with chocolate added in.  I really wonder why it didn\'t have chocolate, which is one of the most  important ingredient of its coffee.  Per its drink list, 80% of its coffee drinks are made with chocolate. And the reason for me to come here is to try the rick and thick hot chocolate.  I was very disappointedBtw, per the list, Paspuccio should be made of espresso, milk, caramel, and CHOCOLATE. Then, how can the waiteress made this coffee if she didn\'t have any chocolate on hands?!  The way is just simply SKIP the chocolate without imforming usFor the food, truely speaking, we didn\'t have much expectation as foods is not their selling point.  We believed that the ravioli was the re-heated frozen food. While for the ""Roma"", we discovered that there were no salad and mushroom sauce inside!  We asked for the reason and once again, the answer was ""out of stock"".  How come they didn\'t inform and explain to the customer?! If we know the truth, we might order another food.  We came here to seek for something special and something we value, but not paying $40 for the ham and tomatoes which I can easily buy in the supermarket and make it by myself in 5 mins!!!I believe it is very important for the owner and waiters to keep in mind: They should understand and provide what the customers value, but not pushing the customers to pay for what they value.'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/wan-chai-caffe-pascucci/26394?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
92,Cali-Mex Taqueria,Causeway Bay,American,2.8,78.0,,"Cali-MexSearching for food in a rush on a drizzly Saturday afternoon, I ducked into an empty Cali-Mex filled with the cheery sounds of Latin music. The shop is bright and well-let, with both table seating and bar-style seating available. I'd passed by this shop a few times, though it always seems to be rather empty. I had about 15 minutes for a quick lunch and there was no queue, so the food only took around 5 minutes to prepare. Located on Jardine's Bazaar, it is around a 5 minute walk to Causeway Bay MTR and Hysan Place, which is super convenient. Decorated with a brightly bizarre mix of orange seats and wooden tables, I can see why most people order take-away.Front Entrance0Front Entrance------------------------------The menu on offer is rather large, with different choices and a step-by-step process to guide you through the mess.3000All the ingredients are spooned onto the wrap and created in front of your eyes, if you care to watch.

The beans were nothing spectacular, soft with a salty taste, The rice and vegetables were crunchy together and complemented the soft beans well. The problem is that apart from saltiness, there isn't really much flavour going on in this burrito. The sauce has inadequate flavour and the whole thing is rather dry. The wrap is soft and thin which isn't necessarily a negative point. Although it wasn't a bad burrito, I wouldn't recommend ordering a mixed bean burrito to anyone. Also for the size, I'm not sure but this seems to pack a lot of calories and salt into a small package. Beans made me feel healthy, but the saltiness drained away any of those feelings as I felt thirsty extremely soon afterwards. It did however keep me full until dinner, so I guess its an easy, fast and convenient lunch for anyone in a rush in CWB.Overall: 3 Stars :S""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-cali-mex-taqueria/452604?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
93,Cali-Mex Taqueria,Central,American,3.1,98.5,5.0,"0It was a while since Mexican fast food first started trending in Hong Kong. There was Taco Truck a few years back, and that mostly seemed to be it. Taco Bell never quite made it in Asian. So it was a very happy day for me when I saw Cali Mex popping up along major spots on HK Island.Beef burrito0Beef burritoSince I reckoned ordering hard taco for takeaway might be a bit messy, I opted for the Regular Beef Burrito ($97) instead. Considering the price tag which could get you a decent sit-down lunch complete with drinks, my expectations were high. My order was with black beans and medium spiciness (actually they only ask for medium or spicy) with added guacamole. By default you also get the usual rice, lettuce and tomato fillings. The combination? A delectable, comforting burrito with robust but balanced flavour underlined with a hint of spiciness - it won't surprise, but it also won't disappoint. The main downside for me was the portion is fast food sized, merely enough for a half meal, but hey, who's complaining.

There aren't many Mexican joints in HK, let alone good ones so I was really looking forward to giving this place a try. The branch in Wanchai is on Queen's Road East right next to Burger King and PP3 - quite conveniently located. Ordering's at the front, and there're seatings on the second floor.That afternoon I was craving for something light so I opted for the Baja fish taco ($98) in medium spice, which was definitely not cheap I thought. *still reminiscing the once-upon-a-tim CAD 99cent tacos at Taco Bell* Food was ready pretty soon and I grabbed a free-seating-fast-food-style table upstairs. The order came in 3 taco shells, although the presentation didn't look too very appealing.0In fact, the food itself didn't taste that great either. The salsa and sour cream was cold, which of course I wasn't surprised but nothing else was even a tiny bit warm, not the taco shell, not the fish. While there're 3 tacos in an order, which worked out to be around $33 each, there was only one small piece of fish found in each one of them, and the rest was stuffed up with veg and sour cream.This place is not worth my second try.

Came here for a quick lunch before heading into the mad art rush.Past reviews said it was a copy of In N  Out...that means zilch to me as I'm Canadian and never had an In N Out.The place is a brightly lit establishment. All the servers wore colorful Hawaiian shirts. There were actually a lot of service staff to proportion of customers which made most of them just hang around chatting. There was also this big tv screen with a nonstop video on California living.Burgers averaged around $70. Which you can add a few more and get a combo with fries and a soft drink. We noticed they served beer and spiked milkshakes but didn't order them because those art shows always serve lots of champagne!I ordered the cheeseburger.

But today I saw it right after I got onto a bus, so I ran off the next stop and walked back there. Such is the importance of location to a burger joint; a good location provides exposure and drives traffic, and traffic drives business. Besides, one of Porter's five forces states...do I sound like your Marketing 101 professor yet?Nice clean interiors0Nice clean interiorsBut of course, food ultimately makes the restaurant. And first impressions count - I walked into Caliburger and was pleasantly surprised by the very clean interiors (even the toilets were gleaming, no pictures though, sorry), and the very welcoming service. The lady at the cashier warned me of onions in the Double Cheeseburger I was to order. I do eat onions, but appreciated the thoughtfulness. Food does make the restaurant, but service and environment are important as well, even for a humble burger joint. And that's why Openrice has rating categories for all these!Cali Double Burger - Mmmm....grease and cheese0Cali Double Burger - Mmmm....grease and cheeseNow on to the food. The Cali Double Cheeseburger(Combo $98)was layered quite well, you can clearly see the lettuce, tomatoes, cheese and two patties sandwiched between the toasted brioche slices. The burger didn't look that big, but it was deceivingly satisfying; the meat tasted similar to McDonald's, but fresher and with more taste. The veggies inside were definitely fresher, you could actually feel the crunch of lettuce and taste the juices in the tomatoes. At the same time, I couldn't help but feel this was a glorified McDonald's burger at quadruple the price, but I actually enjoyed it.Mushroom Swiss Burger - OK but not if you are a 'shroom lover...0Mushroom Swiss Burger - OK but not if you are a 'shroom lover...The Mushroom Melted Swiss Burger (Combo $83) was not as heavy as I expected - everything was there, mushrooms, cheese and meat, but when I bit into it I did not get the explosion of grease, melted cheese and meaty mushroom flavor I love. To me, this was like Mushroom Swiss Burger - Light. I prefer Triple O's version and more so the mushrooms at TheBig Bite in North Point, which are so grease-laden it tastes like gravy. When I go to a fast food burger joint, I expect artery-clogging action to some extent, no need to cut the fat if it is at the expense of flavor I think.0The fries were ok.

Looks like the owner is a handson dude.Complimentary food charging, way to keep people in the shop!...0Complimentary food charging, way to keep people in the shop!...Would I come back for the food? Yes I would, for the Cali double burger, because despite being quadruple MacDonalds price, it hits the spot. Part of the price I'm sure, goes to the attentive service and very well maintained hygiene. What's more, they have a liquor license, you can't get a spiked milkshake elsewhere, can you?

I had to try it, maybe it can live up to the expecations. I ordered the cheeseburger and wild style fries. In just one bite, I already knew the answer...this does not come close to the real thing.Bread - way way way too much bread. A good burger is a balance between the meat and bun ratio. With every bite, you taste the bread more than any other ingredients.Meat - weak! Completely overshadowed by the bun. Definitely doesn't compare to American beef. There's no beefiness to the patty. Grilled onions - for some reason it was dry. Maybe they over cooked it, but it lacked the proper sweetness of an onion. Cheese - store bought, can't go wrong there. Lettuce and Tomato - at least they got this one right.I can tell the fries are frozen and not fresh. How do I know? If you've ever been inside an In-N-Out, they have someone slicing fresh potatoes regularly. I don't see that here. The fries are just plain jane. And the wild sauce, it's too acidic. I suggest lightening up on the relish.Was it worth the price? No! I was only willing to pay $8 USD for a run of the mill cheeseburger simply to try it. But to eat it regularly will not be of value to my wallet.How does Caliburger compare to other burger places in HK? Just average, nothing special unfortunately. Sigh, I had high hopes that HK will finally get a decent burger place. But not today my friends, not today."", ""When everyone talked about it and was looking forward to it, I also was waiting patiently for Caliburger to open! It finally happened and I finally had the time to travel all the way from Tin Shui Wai to Wan Chai for trying this Caliburger. I was full of high expectations and excitment!

I was expecting some burger smell when I walked in, but it didn't happen! Ok! I looked at the menu, I saw the CaliDouble and the price. Wow! $81 for one burger was so expensive! and of course, i needed to try the fries. so, i added $25 for a combo. Total: $106 for a combo. And I saw the Wild Style Fries ($28), and I ordered that too.After about 5 minutes, i got my food!  I tried the fries right a way because I love love love fresh hot fries. Oh o!They were in roomtemperature! What??? I was so surprised in a bad way!!!! and then I tried the Wild Style Fries immediately! They were the same in room tempreature! I was getting a little bit upset! So, i returned the fries to them and told them that the fries were cold. They took the fries right a way and appologized, then they gave me another one. However, the other two fries were just a little bit warmer. Very disappointed!!! The quality of the fries are not special!  Ok! The sauce of the Wild Style Fries was Thousand Island sauce with a lot of grilled onion and cheese. However, the sauce was way too salty and cold. i was speechless!!! The fries totally threw me off!!!! Ok! let's try the burger! The size of the burger was big! However, the quality of the beef was not as fresh, tasty and juicy! Also, the burger was kinda salty to me!!!! The bun and the patties of the burger were just a little bit warm. I was expecting a much warmer burger than that. Overall, my experience in that restaurant was not pleased at all. I was very disappointed and upset! The restaurant was trying to copy the famous In-N-Out in the US.

103,Casa Lounge,Central,Italian,4.2,150.0,0.0,"Location: Its not on the busy main streets of Central and it can be quite hard to find at first because you have to go up a flight of steep stairs before you enter the restaurant. However, I still find it convienient compared to other places in soho.Decoration: This place is beautifully decorated with comfortable sofas. Although the chairs are also quite comfortable themselves, there is little space between the chair and the table, which can cause some discomfort if you have longer legs.Menu: Appetizer buffet costs around 108 and with a main course it would range from 128-148. Main courses (to the best of my memory) include salad, penne, carbonara, risotto, fish, rib eye steak, beef hamburger. Appetizer Buffet: There's not a lot of choice but the quality of the food was generally good. Especially the shrimps and salmon. The shrimps were quite big and tasted very fresh. The vegetables suited a health junkie like me with loads of tomatos and lettice. I liked the salad pasta because of its pesto sauce and it was made al dente. However, my mum thought that it was a bit too hard for her liking. There was also parma ham and different selected cuts. The best thing about the minstrone soup was that it kept me warm after eating so many cold dishes. Main Course: I ordered the grilled rib eye steak (medium) whilst my mum had the grilled fish. We both thought that the grilled rib eye was better than the fish (although the fish itself was okay). I guess for 150 the griled rib eye was already value for money and it was nicely done (I hate over-cooked steak). The portion wasnt big but thats understandable since its supposed to be a semi-buffet. Dessert: There were different kinds of fruits to choose from and the watermelon was very sweet! They only had around 4 types of desserts but it was enough for me already since I was already very full. The cream brulee was probably the worst dish in the lunch menu  but the chocolate cake had a great chocolate mousse layer on top!  I thought the new york cheesecake was a bit weird cos it was a bit too soft and salty. On the other hand, I quite liked the tiramitsu.Drinks: I had iced milk tea and honestly I could have made a better drink than that cos it was practically tasteless.Overall: I was really amazed by the quality of its Appitizer Buffet and I thought the cost was extremely reasonable for a lunch semi-buffet in Central. I like to drink water anyways so i'm not too bothered about its crappy iced milk tea. Plus you get an extra 10% discount if you pay by AE! I definitly recommend this place to other people for lunch!""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-casa-lounge/94318?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw
104,Castello Restaurant,Central,Italian,4.7,130.0,0.0,"I came here with my cousin and her coworker for a farewell lunch. They were just searching through openrice and found this close by new Italian restaurant. We came here not knowing what to expect since it was so new. We arrived at around 12:30 (typical lunch hour) and immediately got seated. They had a set lunch which included soup of the day (today was mushroom soup), pizza or pasta starter, and then a main course, all for only 130! Considering it being located in Central, 130 for a 3 course meal was a steal! As we were skimming the menu trying to figure out what we should try, we came across an italian word which we were unsure of. We asked the waiter what it was and she brought us the a la carte menu which had the descriptions. After we figured out what it meant, the chef came out and personally greeted us and gave us a run down of the foods. When the starters came out the chef asked us what we would like to drink (which is also included in the meal!).I was sick so I couldn't drink anything cold, so I asked for a hot milk tea. Although it wasn't one of the drinks included in the set lunches, he happily made it for me. As we were enjoying our meal, the chef was hanging around and had a nice conversation. We learned about his background and joked around about a few things. He had such a wonderful time he offered us some free sample tiramisu! He said he was confident that it is the best tiramisu we were going to try in Hong Kong. When he brought it out his partner said that it was the best tiramisu ever. So we tried it and I have to say, it's pretty darn good. The texture of the cheese was extremely smooth. The biscuits on the bottom were still crispy and everything just melts together in your mouth creating one of the most incredible tiramisu tastes you will ever try. He invited us to the eventtonight at Castello. He is going to make mozzerella cheese right in front of the restaurant and then uses that freshly made cheese in the dishes at dinner. The event is tonight at Castello, there will be 3 sections 6:30, 7:30, and 8:30. The service is incredible, the food is delicious and the price is reasonable (for being in Central). I would highly recommend everyone to go and at least watch the chef work his magic. Also try the tiramisu!! It's freshly made and the portions are perfect!""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-castello-restaurant/463391?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

I will definitely go there for omurice again. 0', ""0Try not to sit close to the frying pans. It's a bit oily and your clothes will be soaked with the smell if meat and oil. Aside from that, let's give a thumb up to this Jap restaurant for their omelette though its' a little packed.I am not a person who is fond of sauces covering the food. But their curry and tomato sauce just changed my mind and I can't help to finish the whole plate of omelette. I ordered the Cats' Eye Special.

For HK$88, I could get better food elsewhere. The two sauces were pork curry and tomato beef; next to no meat in the curry side and a couple pieces of beef on the tomato side."", 'As a small restaurant specializes in selling omelette rice, the menu choices are rather limited. Curry lovers should be impressed by the combination sets of omelette rice. We ordered omelette rice with curry and cream sauce, demi glace sauce burger, and octopus and seaweed salad. The omelette rice embraced the perfect match of smooth omelette egg and rice. While the cream sauce mixed with diced chicken was savoury, the curry sauce was slightly spicy and salty. But overall, the fusion of 2 different sauces could strike a balance to serve with the plain rice.Omelette Rice with Curry and Cream Sauce0Omelette Rice with Curry and Cream SauceThe burger, however, was slightly ruined by the bitter glace sauce. Fortunately, the piece of burger was large enough to capture our appetite, and the portion of the rice was fairly enough to get us full.Demi Glace Sauce Burger0Demi Glace Sauce BurgerThe octopus and seaweed salad was fresh and colorful. The salad dressing was compatible to the sliced octopus and seaweed. Definitely, it could be a wholesome refreshment followed by serving the heavy burger!Octopus and Seaweed Salad0Octopus and Seaweed SaladI recommend the restaurant for the superior standard of food and service quality.', 'Some friends introduced me to this restaurant, we arrived a bit before noon and got a table for 4 straight away.The paper card to fill your order is in Japanese, but the menu is in english and the waiter is able to help you understand what to circle on your paper card.I ordered the Special Curry Rice with omelette, tomato and burger patty, and a coke. The dish arrived very quickly, and looked massive and yummy. The taste is very good, the spice level is just nice enough to give some taste but not too much so that your mouth is not in fire. Once you finish this dish, you cannot eat anymoreAll in all, a very good restaurant, i will come back again for sure.', ""I was watching a tv show last week that introduced this restaurant, so I took note of it. My cousin works in Wan Chai, so I asked her to join me today.I got there at about 1225, and there was already a queue.Since I was still waiting for my cousin to arrive, I couldn't go in yet, which was very reasonable. The staff gave me 2 order sheets because it was one of those circle your order type of restaurant. The paper was in Chinese only, but there was an English menu on the wall. Ordering Sheet0Ordering SheetEnglish Menu0English MenuWhile waiting for my cousin, the staff approached me and asked me if I would be ordering burgers, and if I were, he'd save some for me because they only do 30 per day. Both my cousin and I wanted the burger, and we so luckily got burger number 28 and 29!I thought it was a very nice gesture of the restaurant to save orders for people since it was my problem that my party wasn't with me. It was only about 1235-40 when the last burger was sold out, so you really have to go early if you want to try it.The interior of the restaurant was very Japanese looking. Small, but cozy. We sat at the table facing the window, which meant the queue. All those hungry looks we got was hilarious. It was even more awkward that we were eating the burgers that they could no longer get.0The food came within a few minutes!I must say, the staff were all very poilte and pleasant. Here is what we consumed:Salad with Sesame Dressing - Amazing dressing$ 200Salad with Sesame Dressing - Amazing dressing$ 201. Salad with Sesame Dressing ($20) Lots of restaurants use that particular Japanese brand of sesame dressing available at supermarkets, but not this place!I'm sure they make their own, because of the aroma and taste! You could really taste the toasted sesame. My gosh, it was so good! The fresh salad only made it better. This was definitely unexpected.Burger with Cream Sauce and Omelet Rice$ 931Burger with Cream Sauce and Omelet Rice$ 932. Burger with Cream Sauce and Omelet Rice ($93)What a beautiful sight this dish was! You knew the golden scrambled eggs in the middle would be delicious just by looking at them, and the truth was the eggs were so light and creamy that each bite was effortless. The sauce on the right was a very concentrated beef sauce that screamed beef! According to them, it is simmered for 3 days to reach such richness. In my opinion, this was the best sauce.Burger2BurgerThe burger was a thick piece of meat with vegetables mixed in. What a nice way to consume more vegetables.The burger had a very soft texture, but didn't taste fatty. My first thought was milk was probably added to the meat mixture for such texture. I wasn't able to taste much spices in the burger, not that I needed to because the taste of beef was already very enjoyable. The white sauce on the left was a chicken cream sauce that was made with Japanese 4.3 Milk and cream.Cream sauces are either very heavy or tasteless, but this was the opposite of both! Not only was it light, it was also very flavourful. It went well with the omelet rice.Burger with Tomato Sauce and Omelet Rice$ 934Burger with Tomato Sauce and Omelet Rice$ 933. Burger with Tomato Sauce and Omlete Rice ($93) The only difference between this dish and the dish above is the one sauce. Instead of the cream sauce, my cousin chose the tomato sauce with beef short ribs. This was an amazing sauce. The tomato sauceis simmered for 8 hours with onions and carrots. No wonder itwas so rich because it absorbed the best of all the ingreidents. The beef was tender, but the star was still the rich tomato sauce.Final Verdict:0."", ""Came here for lunch as I had seen it when I was at the Cupping Room across the street. I noticed it served only omurice and really wanted to give it a try.I love omurice. It's a simple bit of comfort food that is rooted deep in my University days when I was a big anime/manga geek. It comprises of two basic ingredients. Rice wrapped in egg. It can come with ketchup or with various meat based sauces. My favorite place that made the best omurice was Hidden Kitchen but it has sadly closed. Various other places that serve it are not good at all.Located in Wanchai, down the same street as The Cupping Room and Veygo Coffee, is this place called Cats' Eye. It seems this street is starting to evolve into a hip little street. The restaurant isn't big. It was a bit set up like a ramen place. They only serve one thing. Omurice. However, you can choose the different sauces. That is basically pork, beef or chicken. You order by circling your order on a little sheet of paper much like a ramen restaurant. What they give you is Chinese but you can ask for an English menu. Service was a bit off for when I went to enter the restaurant, the staff accidently closed the door when they meant to open it and then didn't apologize for it. Then I had to ask for water and was left waiting until I had to ask again.1I ordered beef and chicken omurice. ($78). The beef sauce is brown sauce on the left and the chicken sauce is the white sauce on the right. The rice was Japanese rice but it was a bit soggy. The egg was soft but a bit undercooked and still runny. The sauce was alright though the meat from the chicken tasted a bit bouncier than regular chicken meat. Size portion was alright for me but I assume for someone with a bigger appetite, it probably wouldn't be enough.0It's ok. I wouldn't be eager to return again.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/wan-chai-cats-eye/189381?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

I'm not a big fan. Too much rocket isn't nice, to be honest - it's peppery, numbs your tongue and its taste is too strong. As in, I'd love having rocket mixed into a salad containing other leaves, but i do not prefer a stand-alone rocket salad. However, the sweet poached pear complemented it well - and so did the thin disc of provolone (cheese). Really - pear with rocket is an excellent combination - we used to make it at home, only we used canned pears, because the syrup from the can of pears can be mixed into the dressing linguine ai olio with mixed veg linguine ai olio with mixed veg0linguine ai olio with mixed vegDoes it sound boring to you?

Will find her a substitute and then I can have tiramisu at home. This one: lady fingers soaked up a lot of that tia maria (or the like), was COLD enough (good good), in the vanilla sauce you could see them vanilla pods  and i appreciated the almond biscuit flakes.

I had been here for dinner previously and was quite impressed by the quality of the food. The lunch sets did not disappoint either. As there were more than 20 in our party, we were requested by the restaurant to pre-order to ensure sufficient time for preparation. The service was polite and food was served up in a timely manner.  The 3-course lunch sets were very affordable, ranging from $88 to $108.Set lunch menu0Set lunch menu Appetizers were a choice of a soup and a variety of salads. The Caesar salad had fresh greens and crunchy croutons, though a little more bacon and cheese would have been preferred.There were quite a few main courses to select from, ranging from pasta, rice, fish, chicken, and various types of red meat.  I ordered the baby lamb fillet without realizing that it came with a mint gravy, which I do not normally enjoy. I was a little concerned after I caught a whiff of the mint when the dish was set before me. But was I in for a surprise! The mint in the gravy was very light. The gravy was a good balance of sweet and sour and a perfect complement to the tender lamb strips. I would definitely go back for it. Baby lamb fillet0Baby lamb fillet I had a taste of the seafood paella that my colleague ordered and it was quite nice too. The rice was cooked just right and the portion of seafood was generous. The feedback on the grilled ribeye steak was also favorable.The set lunch included a choice of beverages or dessert of the day. I was hoping that tiramisu would be offered as I recall it to be quite good when I had it on my previous visit.

The only drawback was that the sauce was a bit too sweet for me.  But overall, it was still a very enjoyable pizza.Cat concluded the lunch with a tiramisu and vanilla ice-cream.  The tiramisu was a bit disappointing as it lacked a bit of mascarpone cheese.  I had ice tea instead of dessert, and it was ok.0All in all, the place and the service were great and the food was above average.I noticed on my way out that they served set lunch starting from $88.

Will encore and revisit this hidden place in Soho."", 'I got the coupon from groupon.com at a price of $6x per set lunch.  I suppose the coupons would serve the purpose as if customers are having a ""tasting"" session with less portion. I know the restaurant has another shop on Granham Street and did try that before. The pasta there was quite good. Therefore, I rest assure that the new restaurant should have more or less the standard of the dishes they serve.My friend and I have ordered salad and soup of the day as the starter, sirloin steak as the main course, coffee for him and dessert for me.To me, I always value the bread that comes first. The bread, tasting like sponge cake, baked with onion and rosemary. Very tasty. We have therefore asked for another round...The soup of the day was pumpkin soup, which was my favourite. It seemed that the chef had added in some potatoes so as to make it more creamy with more texture. That\'s really nice.My friend had also enjoyed the tuna salad. The portion was big, as a starter. As for the steak, a bit disappointed, as there was no taste of beef, and it was not tender enough. Yet, I did appreciate the presentation of the dish when it was served, with plenty of side dishes like vegetables in different colours and mashed potatoes.The coffee tasted bold and full. The dessert, which was tiramisu that day, also as traditional as it should be.The female waiter there was very nice with passion. According to the ""rules"" of the coupon, we could only order either tea/coffee or dessert. But the lady treated us one more dessert, which made us surprised. I did appreciate that.I would like to highlight the spacious seating of the restaurant, which should be good for fine dining or dating. onion and rosemary bread0onion and rosemary breadnot tasty and tender, but presentation is good0not tasty and tender, but presentation is goodtiramisu0tiramisu'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-cenacolo-ii/56049?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
108,Cenacolo Steak & Pasta,Central,Italian,3.6,120.0,0.0,"After finishing my latest watercolor portrait (which took me 50+ painful hours to do so), I decided visit the art galleries and the small streets in Soho on a Monday morning. Despite being a symbol of the swanky boisterous nightlife side of Central, Soho is actually a very quite and peaceful area in daytime. The sharp visual contrast between the exotic, extravagantly furnished bars and restaurants and the shabby historic neighborhood seems to be blurred under the same peacefulness. Simply seeing the streetviews made me I feel extremely refreshed and content. After the relaxing walk, I decided to have my lunch in Cenacolo. The restaurant is pretty quiet and cozy. It was around 12:30 pm when I went in there and there were only around 3 to 4 tables of customer. Just like most of the western restaurants nearby, Cenacolo provides weekday 3-courses lunchsets including an appetizer, a main course, and a drink or dessert. I chose smoke salmon with mixed salad for the appetizer, mushroom risotto for the main, and iced coffee for the drink. A bread basket was served after I ordered. It was one of the best bread baskets I have ever tried in Hong Kong! The bread was warm. It\'s crispy on the outside, and instead of having the usual soft or chewy bread texture on the inside, it had a moist and dense texture almost like that of a pound cake. The bread had a rich flavor of fresh herbs. It was a bit too salty alone but it tasted just right after dipping into the balsamic vinegar and olive oil. bread basket and salad0bread basket and saladThe salad was fresh but it didn\'t made a strong impression. The smoke salmon was of average quality. The vinaigrette dressing wasn\'t enough.After finishing the salad, the risotto was served. The risotto was cooked in perfect timing which gave the rice a chewy uncooked texture. It was served with a generous amount of porcini mushrooms. However, the sauce wasn\'t rich and creamy enough (at least for me). Mushroon risotto0Mushroon risottoI only ordered my iced coffee after finishing my meal because I didn\'t want the ice in the coffee to be melting while I was eating. Yet to my disappointment, the coffee was diluted and watery even when it was freshly made. On top of that, the coffee was too sour. It was as bad as the iced coffee I had in Urban Bakery Works in Central Landmark. Overall, the food in Cenacolo is nice and reasonably priced. p.s. I chose to write my dining experience in Cenacolo as my first review because I weren\'t used to ""let the camera eat first"" and it was the first time I remember to take photos of the food ;P Sorry for the poor picture quality. I will write more reviews on the food I tried before but unfortunately those will probably be without photos (I will try to describe as detailed as possible to compensate for that, haha)'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-cenacolo-steak-pasta/18245?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

The sea eel was quite big given the price. I would say it was quite a good value for money given that sea eel is so expensive nowadays. It was not really hot when served but still ok - i.e. the normal flavour of sea eel you would expect. The stir-fried udon itself was pretty good too - which was done quite well and al dente!

111,ChangLe Vegetarian Restaurant,Causeway Bay,Chinese,3.8,88.0,0.0,"A friend of mine who works in Causeway Bay informed me of this new lunch spot he had found and highly recommended it to me. He told me the food was healthy and delicious. So, I decided to give it a try.Located in the new L Square building (where there are only a handful of shops rented out), is a Chinese vegetarian restaurant. The layout is simple. Spacious tables and chairs. Everything is clean and minimalistic.Lunch menu is what is presented to you during lunch hour. Though they do have an a la carte menu upon request. Everything is written in Chinese and English. Prices under $100. I didn't feel like soup (though table next to me had soup and it looked to be a very good Chinese soup) so I chose the appetizer and vegetarian pork belly with vegetables ($88). A pot of buckwheat tea was also given to me which was ok as tea went.lunch0lunchDaily appetizers were presented to me. From left to right: spicy bamboo shoots with jews ear, green beans with seaweed, winter melon with black bean. All were chilled and quite refreshing. The spicy bamboo shoots with jews ear was crunchy and not too spicy. The green beans were crisp. And the winter melon was soft. None were overly salty.appetizer0appetizerMy main was vegetrian pork belly with brocolli, red and green peppers and carrots.

Not expensive, healthy and yummy. Will return.Should note that there is 10% service charge but apparently they are new so for the time being they remove the 10% service charge from the bill. As it was new, they also gave me a stack of VIP cards to pass to friends.

There was no wait outside the restaurant and we waited barely for 3 minutes before we were invited in.It was a full house.My girlfriend and I ordered 4 different kinds of dumplings for lunch.The dumplings are crispy, tasty and not too oily.The price is relatively higher when compared to other dumpling restaurants, costing us $200 for just 4 dishes.It's worth the money and is recommended for new customers, but whether it's worth for a second visit highly depends on how much one is obsessed with dumplings.After all, it was a positive dining experience.Chaochao Dumpling - The Chaochao is their signature dish.

A city that seems obsessed with Japanese food of all kinds. Something Japanese sprouts up ... queues will follow.Boyfriend and I came here for lunch. We arrived around 2 so it was right after the lunch crowd, thus no line or perhaps it was still very new. Located in Wanchai, it's not a very big shop (though I noted a staircase leading upstairs and wonder if there will be upstairs seating later). The layout is like a typical ramen shop. Except what they serve is gyoza of all kinds and flavors (even a dessert variety) along with a few snacks. Menu is in English, Japanese and Chinese with plenty of photos.They have a lunch menu that seems to include a bowl of rice along with appetizer and gyoza. We didn't order this as we wanted to order a number of gyoza instead. However, I saw the size of the rice and it was pretty small. It was more like a couple of bites of rice so don't expect it to be filling.lunch menu0lunch menuI noted that they had instructions for how to eat gyoza. Or at least what sauces to use. Thus, for our first time here, we followed instructions.0Soy sauce is on the left and the miso is on the right. Miso was very light in taste. It wasn't very strong. Same with the soysauce. Personally, I prefer the soysauce. The miso was a bit odd using it on gyoza. I guess I'm just not used to it.0There was also a spicy paste that you use to mix into the miso if you want it spicy. It wasn't too spicy and bit on the salty side.0There was also some chlli oil if you want that.0Chao Chao Gyoza (8 pieces for $22, 16 pieces for $40).We ordered the 8 piece portion as we planned to order other gyoza and I feared we may over order. Well, let me say one thing ... portion is SMALL. This is their signature gyoza. It had a really nice sweet pork filling and the skin was thin yet pan fried to a perfect crispiness.0But like I said ... size is small. The gyoza was like a sliver and probably equated to 2 chopsticks in width.0Chicken and Mozzarella Cheese Gyoza ($38 for 5 pieces).This was really good. The chicken meat was minced and mixed with cheese.0Four Types Gyoza Platter ($42, total of 8 pieces).We decided to order a platter to try four more flavors. This included (from left to right): puri puri shrimp, Kujo spring onion, mushroom with rice wrappier and Awajishima onion. There was a plate of salt provided for dipping. The flavors of Kujo onion didn't really stand out but the Awajishima onion had a strong very leek liike taste. The puri puir shrimp gyoza made it taste like I was eating a wonton. But the mushroom gyoza stood out. It was wrapped in rice paper instead of the usual gyoza wrapper so it was even thinner. It had a woody taste from the mushroom.0Long Stick Gyoza with Crab Meat and Shrimp Stick ($38 for one).This came with a mayo dipping sauce. On the menu it said it was 180 cm long. But it tasted like gyoza wrapped imiation crab stick. I like imitation crab stick but it slightly disappointed me as it wasn't that great.0Portion size is very small. I wasn't even remotely full after I finished and we totalled to $154 at the end. Boyfriend was still starving. The food is good but portions is way too small to have an actual filling meal especially when you can pay for the same price elsewhere and be so full, you're rolling out the door with a round belly. I would return again because I thought it tasted pretty good and I eat lightly. But boyfriend said he wouldn't be back as it wasn't enough for him. I suspect this would be the case for many as I overheard two other men comment that the food was good but they were still hungry after spending almost $100 worth of food.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/wan-chai-chao-chao-gyoza/488788?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

114,Charming Cuisine,Causeway Bay,Chinese,3.6,70.0,,"Came here for dimsum after noontime with a friend, so only ordered a few dishes between us two.Food:  Overall, the food was good, exceeded my expectations considering the restaurant is tucked away on Cannon Street, on the 2F of this building accessible by escalator.  I ordered Har Gow; Chicken feet; Taro drippy buns; Shrimp rice rolls; Chicken/pork/mushroom sticky rice wrapped in tea leaves.  The har gow were the standard, the shrimp here was diced pieces instead of whole.  The chicken feet had good color and flavor and came over a bed of peanuts, however the peanuts were not as stewed with flavor as I prefer.  The shrimp rice rolls were pretty unique in the sense of the arrangement it came - it came diced in bite sized pieces in a long tray with few pieces of asparagus between each piece.  The texture of the rice roll skin was nice and silky with good bite of whole shrimp in each piece - very yummy.  Although this total portion is less than the standard 3 rolls, it is still quite appetizing.  The taro buns were interesting - its a different healthier alternative than the drippy egg yolk buns, and less sweet too.  It was a hit with me.  Lastly I also liked the chicken sticky rice wrapped in tea leaves due to fact there were 3 of them instead of the usual 1 big one or 2.  I enjoyed the smaller yet tasty portion which can be better shared with more people.  Service:  The usual you'd expect.  The food came pretty quick and piping hot.  There were enough waiters for the tables. The menu is in Chinese, so not as accessible to foreigners I guess.Decor:  Pretty nice, better than Fung Shing near the MCL JP theatre, but obviously it is not up to par to the pricier chains like West Villa or Fu Sing.  However, Charming's decor was presentable and clean, with large screen TVs scattered everywhere so there's definitely entertainment. Sizing it up:  I really do like this place - it has good value dimsum in a pretty clean and presentable environment.  The bill was only $140 as compared to pricier but not necessarily that much better dimsum places which would've costed $300+.  Also an incentive to coming here would be the $9.8 special for small/medium/large dimsum anytime before noon!  So that would be even cheaper better value.  Also, need to note that the restaurant was pretty packed when I went and the clientele being all locals/families, so I can assume that this place is doing decently that it attracts such a local following.  I'd definitely come again.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-charming-cuisine/38050?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

We booked in advance and were taken to our table immediately. By 12 noon the restaurant was over 1/2 full. By 12.30 to 12.45 people were waiting outside.Clean and welcoming environment. Dim Sum menu was predominantly available in chinese and english. (only one small paper sheet containing noodle dishes was written purely in chinese)Child friendly.A selection of some of the dishes we ordered: Baked Pork Buns - exterior sweet and buttery, interior slightly sour but tender pork. Very delicious  Prawn Dumplings (har gao) - Interior predominantly prawn with no large bits of garlic or ginger. Nicely seasoned. Exterior was not too thick or chewy and was easy to eat. One of the better prawn dumplings I have had. Old Style Spring Rolls - these were a pleasant surprise. Not too oily, the interior was made with bean sprouts and a very small amount of mushroom. Despite the simplicity they had a very nice taste and a pleasant change from the chinese spring rolls served at other Yum Cha establishments.  Dumplings with chilli sauce - they seemed like a larger version of the prawn dumplings, and were soggy in comparison.  The chilli sauce was very average.The dumplings had been overcooked and were the most disappointing dish of the meal.  Egg Tart (daan tart) - portions were small. Flaky pastry was ok. Waiters were robotic and showed very little emotion, but were efficient with requests. Food was delivered in a timely manner. Only disappointment came when we ordered a dish but were never told it was no longer available on the menu. Expensive for a Yum Cha, but worth it for a nice change from the normal mass market Yum Cha restaurants. Will definitely return."", 'There is less and less yum cha places in Central, so I am exploring Wanchai.This turns out to be a very nice yum cha!

As it was near where I lived, boyfriend and I came here. Was that ever a mistake.I find Tao Heung to be quite a good group of restaurants. Reasonable prices for quality food. But this place was something else.We ordered a variety of dim sum items.Stir Fried Vermicelli. This was part of a combo that came with curry squid. It looked like it wasn't seasoned but it was. It just sprinkled with MSG and stir fried.0Curry Squid. The curry was a bit too oily and wasn't very spicy. Squid was extremely chewy.0Pan Fried Pork Buns. These were very oily. The pork meat was ok and so was the bread.0Goldfish Shrimp Dumplings. The skin on the dumplings were too thick. Otherwise, not too bad.0Steamed Chinese Sponge Cake (Mah Lai Goh). This was pretty good. Nice and spongy. Not too sweet. I liked it.0Eggrolls. These were also extremely oily. I really didn't like them at all. It felt like eating mouthfuls of oil.0Fried Doughsticks Rice Rolls. The fried doughsticks were soggy and not crispy like good ones usually are. This made for one chewy item.0We had originally ordered quail egg siu mai. This item never came. When we asked what happened to our item, a staff member shouted to another staff member to ask and then there was no follow up. We asked three more times and each time, the same thing happened with no follow up. Then I overheard someone say to another table they had run out when they were ordering. So, we asked again what happened to our item or was it sold out and therefore, that is why it never appeared. Again a staff member shouted to ask another staff member to follow up and no follow up was returned. Finally out of frustration, I hailed management. This rarely happens for me to complain to management, but I was getting really angry. I just wanted an answer. I knew my siu mai was never going to appear as they had run out but I JUST WANTED AN ANSWER! I complained about the no follow up on my request. The manager responded that there were no more quail egg siu mai as they had just sold out. I complained that I ordered this 2 hours ago and it had just sold out but I had asked constantly for them throughout my dining. Manager apologized for this and offered another item, but I declined, so the siu mai was taken off our order as it never came. I found that staff here seemed either untrained or understaffed. I cannot explain why else a simple follow up could not be done by anyone until I complained to someone higher up.

120,Cheng Ban Zheung Taiwan Beef Noodle,Causeway Bay,Chinese,1.1,45.0,,"There is always a bully at school. Instead of being the uber-cool kid, he\'s strong on the outside, weak on the inside. often vulnerable or ended up sobbing in the bathroom type. The psychology within the bully is common but often avoided of discussions, not because we don\'t want to expose them, but possibly because there is a bully in all of us -- at times when we get cocky and say things or show off we\'re better than others because we have certain experiences, first hand or from other sources. The God-complex is frowned upon, and often times, the bullies are not like, not even among his own peeps who pretended to be the wind beneath his wings. Take note, the \'subordinates\' are just waiting for a time to let you slip and take over you the same way you bully others. Adult life, full of politics and bitchslapping, is indeed nowhere different from play at the school playground. The bullies are seldom considered rogue -- they threaten, or get defensive by putting down everyone else to boast of their own power-status. For what, exactly, the competitive edge? Chairman Cheng, we all heard the story, so overplayed in the past couple weeks since its opening in its convenient corner shop location. The shop showcases trophies upfront, and a never-ending list of awards won. The Taiwanese shop collaborated with local KUEN FAT Restaurant to open this shop, serving both the Chairman\'s classic beef noodles as well as signatures from the collaborated restaurant, in short, one can find everything in it -- something Hongkie-style, curries Malay-style, and a whole lot of deep fried treats. The Chairman Cheng menu consists of two pages over the entire menu, not to mention an array of Taiwanese tea parlour beverages. Located at the corner shop, the shop had a challenge when it comes to fixing the seating. Through a narrow shop space the owner could only maximize seating in the narrowest of space. It\'s not helping when you are larger than a size 2, or a grown man. The seats themselves are extremely \'shallow\', in a sense that anyone bigger is likely to have problem sitting comfortably without half their bottoms in midair. But that, can\'t be help. The NOODLES with ROASTED BEEF, BEEF TENDON, and BEEF TRIPE (, $48) arrived in hot dark brown broth, with thick wavy noodles bathed in it. Three Treasures -- beef tendons, honeycomb  tripe, and pieces of stewed beef, are dished up across the top of the noodles, rouneded out by a sprinkle of pickles and choy-sum. A layer of gloss afloats the noodles. Was it part of the Yunnan tradition of the ""over the bridge noodles"" or was I imagining it? The noodles themselves were wonderful, it bears the curiously surprisingly bite and chewiness, commonly known to many as ""Q"". THe elastic noodles stretch and relax between bites, as if they\'ve got a life on their own. The broth, supposedly tasting rich and beefy, was not quite there. After you get past the layer of oil by brushing it aside, the broth beneath was surprisingly thin, with the faintest of star anise and cassia bark lurking beneath. It was just a hint, not big enough to join in the overall aroma that entertains the palate. The flavour of the broth was so light that all the supposedly present tastes were there, and harmonizing, and so extremely light that one couldn\'t help but wonder, ""did they add water?"". The vegetables are alright, and so are the pickles, which bear a decided crunch with a sharp vinegary tang. But the meats were as predicted, a major disappointment. The honeycomb tripe, usually sliced into strips, was now in thin angular slices. The shape of the slices didn\'t help it from being chewy and rubbery. The problem with them is that some slices are rubbery and some slices are soft. Did they all come from one piece? Or was there a stewing method that can allocate the stewing in certain parts so that one part is softer than the other? Only the Chairman can tell. The tendons were nowhere near \'gelatinous\'. In fact, some smaller pieces were downright hard. It\'s not at a point that will crunch anyone\'s teeth, but it\'s cooked on the very surface but once you sink your teeth in you\'re likely to get your teeth stuck (and when you pull that piece out you can see an indent of your teethmarks on it) . For the stewed beef, please read on in this next order of noodles.  The PRESERVED BEEF WITH NOODLES (, $42), I believed, was a misunderstood dish. Some complained about the noodles clumping together, some complained about the oil. And at the initial presentation at the table. It didn\'t look anything like it. But once the chopsticks were in action, all the problems arose. The noodles were cooked through and had wonderful textures like the previous bowl. However they did clump together like one big piece. (on hindsight I should\'ve just stuck my chopsticks in and see if I could deliver a picture of me holding the entire bowlful capacity of noodles with two chopsticks, as if I hold them on a stick. The picture never happened but the possibility was sound.) The noodles, upon stirring with the ""sauce"", turned into a glistening brown mass that may have reminded me of an absent-minded cook who forgot he already blessed the noodles with sesame oil 3 times in the past minute. It was so laden with oil that the noodles were so slurpable without any broth. The oil may have been there to make slurping easier, but it certainly did not make consuming the noodles any easier than it should\'ve been. The The stewed beef, present in both noodles, were tough. There was only one word for it. They were also very dry and turned into shreds everytime someone takes a bite into it. It feels like they have made soup out of it and decided to throw them in for substance. They forgot about the textures though. Some pieces were so tough that the teeth gave in and gave up during its chewing motions. The dried-tofu sauce acted like a sauce for the noodles as well. Yet the sauce itself was so sugary sweet and the tofu was inconsistently textured (some turned mushy some were very chewy). If there is anything good about the sauce -- most of the dried tofu dices were of the same size-- uniformly cut up. It was also uniformly oily like the mess below the noodles. At one point it felt like noodles stirred with brown butter with an overdose of brown sugar and bovril mixed together. There was a ""marinated dried flower""(, $18) in the menu which was supposedly typical Taiwanese food -- by cooking some fried tofu (cut in a way to open up on contact to heat) And then the Chairman decided to take the specialty off the menu because they couldn\'t source it anymore. I wondered why couldn\'t they source somewhere else if it\'s something they take pride in so much, and emphasized in so many interviews about how they specially sourced their materials to make sure that dishes coming out of that kitchen is the best? Why can\'t they try harder? Was it because they have confidence in themselves over other competitors? Or was it because they spent countless hours trying to set the story straight to people who have never been there, trying to change their minds about returning to generate a popularity buzz? That, let\'s leave it for the readers and the owners to decide. Backstory: The first visit at Chairman Cheng was a pleasant one. It was on the second day of its opening. The noodles were chewy while the broth was rich and flavorful. The beef were inconsistent -- hard and soft at the same time, not nearly enough to be called ""good"". The diners are squeezed into seats while idling staff were messaging on the cell phones while hungry diners waited outside looking yearningly at one or two stray tables waiting to be seated. After a few weeks, some things have changed. There were no longer stray tables, the line was forever, and diners can\'t wait to see whether they can get a taste of something straight from Taiwan. It\'s not that Chairman\'s Cheng\'s mission has gone down the drain, or that he\'s failed in impressing the local crowd with his baby. That matter was worse, it got stuck with inconsistency in so many ways and levels that things were good sometimes at something but bad other times. One could only wish that they were lucky enough to get a perfect bowl of noodles they were promised to from pamphlets and even the words from the Chairman himself. The proud words of the Chairman still resound at the staff\'s ears, convincing them they are the future monopolizing the local Beef Noodle market, and that only they can beat themselves. It could be true, if one decided to spent more effort and time into perfecting their own signature, not parading around with a God-complex thinking they already ARE better than everyone, ticking off every offensive box in the rulebook putting down other joints. People are eating it up -- the noodles and the words, but whether or not people are buying into the failed promise of an establishment that acted like a bully in a school playground, only time will tell whether they can deliver the promise they brag they already got it in the bag. Real or imaginary, success or failure, only the owners there can tell. Note: On a completely different issue, the translation of the menu truly is bad. Not as bad as ""Albert Yip"", but  it\'s close to that. They had the nerve to translate """"directly into ""Marinated Dried Flower"" (which has no flower of any kind in the dish.

But then I realized it was partially in liquid form so I slurped it up like a jello shot.0Overall, the food was pretty good. Especially better if you love spicy food. But even if you can\'t eat spicy like me, they do offer nonspicy options. Prices for lunch are reasonable and portion sizes are generous enough. It comes with a soup, drink and dessert. All for under $100 per person, that to me is a good deal. No wonder there are a good number of people eating and still coming after prime lunch hour was over.'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-chili-party/494429?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

Boyfriend remarked he wanted to give i a try so ... in we went.Like your typical noodle shop it serves up beef brisket and all sort of balls. Menu is in Chinese and English.I decided to have this. Beef brisket with fish balls in vermicelli ($35). Noodles were fine but the soup base was extremely salty and just tasted like MSG. The fish balls were not very bouncy and didn't really have much fish taste. The beef brisket fared better and I noticed they gave me some pieces of beef flank. It was moist and pretty tender.0Boyfriend ordered beef flank rice noodles ($33). I felt the beef flank tasted beefier but it was a lot more chewier than the beef brisket. I also found it odd that they didn't have tendon as well as most places that do offer beef brisket throw in some tendon as well.0For $10, boyfriend added stewed daikon. I thought it was ok but he seemed to like it quite a bit.0Noodles were ok but the fishballs were quite disappointing. I guess stick to the beef brisket from now on."", 'Was thinking of grabbing a quick lunch after buying dinner ingredients at the nearby market. On the way back home, I saw Chiu Hing Noodle House and decided to drop by for some simple noodle dish. I ordered Four Treasures Hor Fun with addition of seaweed and an iced lemon tea. The order came within minutes as the place was barely full. Huge bowl of noodles with a combination of squid, fish and meat balls, as well as slice of fish cake and beef cake. The ingredients were fresh and delicious, despite it being just a simple bowl of noodles. I particularly like the beef cake as it was the first time I had this in a chiu chow style fishball noodles. The soup broth was flavorful as well. Sometimes, there is no need to go to an expensive restaurant to enjoy good food. To be able to have excellent food in a small local caf is also one of lifes simple pleasures here in Hong Kong.'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/wan-chai-chiu-hing-fishball-rice-noodle/16588?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

It was chic and fresh. Young and hip. What made it even more appealing was the fact they sold maki. I love sushi rolls.The menu is in English and Chinese. There is no 10% service charge. They have recommended rolls for $68 or you can create your own for $78. They also have smaller size rolls and sides for a small add on price. You order and pay at the cashier and they'll bring it to you when ready.0Too lazy to create my own that day, I ordered the Sea Monster ($68). A giant maki with crab stick, tempura prawn, sprouts, cucumber, topped witjh sakura shrimp, garlic chips and sweet potato powder. It was served with unagi sauce and a house special sauce that tasted a bit like siracha. There was a few slices of pickled daikon that weren't sour at all. I wonder if they were even pickled? The maki was ok. It did fall apart quite easily when I picked it up with my chopsticks. Love the crunch of the tempura shrimp and the freshness of the ingredients.0I added $8 for a miso soup. Oddly it didn't taste like much miso was added. It was more like a vegetable soup with bits of tofu in it. It was good but didn't feel like miso soup.0Overall, the place was ok. I liked it enough but it also oddly reminded me of the Japanese in Canada. When I had never tried actual Japanese food. It felt like the westernized Japanese. It wasn't terrible but it also wasn't really Japanese. Items I'd find at a food truck in the US. That type of food. Would I be back? Probably if I wanted a quick bite that reminded me of the westernized Japanese back home and it was not too expensive. The staff was friendly, too."", 'Summary: If you like sushi rolls, but wish they had more exciting ingredients (or had non-raw fillings), Chotto Maki is the place for you. A light, fresh and tasty high-concept lunch spot. Try the pre-set rolls!Chotto Maki is a cool idea  giant but affordable sushi rolls that you stuff with any number of ingredients, freshly prepared on the spot. Each order comes with four giant pieces and costs about HKD 60-70. For normal people, I think its just the right serving size for lunch, though guys might want to add an extra ingredient or some other toppings.Though they only prepare sushi rolls, if you like vinegared rice wrapped in seaweed, you have quite a bit of freedom to stuff them with whatever youre feeling like that day. I tried the DIY version with salmon, mixed greens, seaweed (more like kelp), avocado, a Tobiko (flying fish roe) topping, with their house sauce / wasabi mayo tastefully drizzled over the top. While it was tasty and fresh, I felt like I wasnt embracing the concept fully, and when I tried my friends Beef-iyaki roll (which was DELICIOUS) I got it.Dont think of this place as a traditional sushi joint. This is not a place for purists; fish-wise, only tuna and salmon are offered, and while good, I think choosing fish is missing the point. You should be going for maximum impact with the non-traditional ingredients and their delicious homemade sauces. Try their pre-set rolls first, which are packed with complementary (sometimes surprisingly complementary) ingredients and, while they sound kinda nuts, are flavor-packed. After all, you can get a salmon avocado roll anywhere, but where else can you get a Teriyaki beef, cucumber, tofu skin, avocado, garlic chip, Unagi sauce roll?Overall, Chotto Maki is a nice addition to Central lunching (something new for a change!), and the price point and freshness of ingredients are a big plus. Its not for everyone of course, but if you go in with an open mind (Embrace the Flavor!), you wont be disappointed.'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-chotto-maki/551993?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

Not much complaint except that there was no welcoming bread basket with vinegar/olive oil to welcome you. Environment was great for a happy-hour drink.

As is typical with most western eateries operated by F&B corps, servers are staffed by a south Asian team, most of whom are OK but I could picture some improvement there.

Seating was not particularly spacious and the pizza wasnt spectacular given that diners, including myself, do come with some expectations. I am speculating that this place is probably a better option for a spontaneous, casual drink on a breezy night.

137,Coedo Taproom,Causeway Bay,Japanese,3.4,195.0,0.0,"0 This eatery is located in Causeway Bay Fashion Walk, opened by Coedo Brewery which is an award-winning brewery from Saitama Japan, aiming to showcase their beer. Arriving on this Sat early afternoon, the place has just opened and we were the first couple of customers.0The decor is simple, with a counter overlooking the beer taps as well as dining tables where customers can enjoy some yakitori and other snacks. Seated comfortably at the inside of the restaurant I ordered a beer to begin with. The Marihana ($98) has a really nice delicate, fresh and good citrus hop flavors. The light alcohol level is also appealing. A truly nice IPA.0 We started with some kushiyaki, with the Shiitake Mushroom ($32 each) having three large mushroom per skewer, and in the middle there is a nice cut to reminiscent of a star. Decent in taste, the seasoning is appropriate and the mushroom not too dried.0Next is Chicken Gizzard ($38 each). The small pieces of gizzard is nicely grilled and with a few of the lime added it gives a refreshing note to the nice chewy texture of the gizzards. A good kushiyaki.0 Then it was Chicken Meatball with Cartilage and Basil ($38 each). My favorite in all the skewers, the minced chicken got a great crunchy bite from the added cartilage, and was grilled perfectly with the charred on the outside to add to the aromas. On top there is a basil sauce like pesto which further enhanced the overall flavors.0Ordering the Yakitori and Egg Donburi ($92) as my main dish, the rice is quite nice, with plenty of mushroom and onion pairing with the pieces of grilled chicken, and the sauce seeped into the rice underneath making them flavorful and moist. The sweetness of the onion gave a nice balance to the savory of the sauce and the mushroom adding to the fragrance. The grilled chicken however was in my opinion too dried and affected how we might enjoy this dish.0 My wife had the Chicken Soup with Rice Porridge ($80) instead and it was quite good as well. Overall I am quite satisfied with the eatery, having first imagine it to be just a beer place and did not have too much expectation on the food. But indeed everything is fairly good. Service was decent too along with the total dining experience.The bill was $535 which is reasonably priced. If you want some nice beer pairing with Japanese food, this is a place in Causeway Bay that I would recommend. Maybe next time it is also good to try out the flight of all their products for a beer tasting.', ""There is beer and then there is craft beer.

Offering a wide selection of their beers on tap, they also offer other brands as well that they call guest beers. For about $60 - 100 a glass, you can get a Coedo on tap. But here's a deal for you if you love beer.Come at lunch. For if you order their lunch set, for an additonal $10, you get a small glass of beer.Lunch includes a main, salad, dessert and drink. Upgrade to a small Coedo beer for $10. Prices for a set starts at $58. Food is mainly Japanese style.0Small Size Ruri Coedo Draft Beer. A light tasting beer that was quite refreshing. Not too strong, the way I like it. Beer lovers might want something a bit stronger but for me, it was just right. If you aren't sure, the staff is really know the products and can suggest a choice for you.0Salad was just as a simple salad with ranch dressing and what appeared to be cereal puffs. It was ok. Not great. Just ok.0Unagi and tofu donburi ($98) was my main of choice. Size portion was not big. In fact rather small. It's definitely ok for small eaters but for big eaters, I have no idea what they would do. It was ok. The eel was not overcooked. The mixture of tofu into the rice was fine though a bit on the wet side.0The dessert, however, was excellent. A matcha daifuku with a sweet azuki bean filling. There was also a soft warabi mochi lightly powdered with soybean powder and sweetened with black sugar syrup. This was delightful and i loved the dessert the most.0Lunch was average aside from the dessert which was excellent. Definitely come here for beer if you love beer ad looking for a deal. Because a small size usually costs around $60 so for $10, this is a steal.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-coedo-taproom/457960?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

Toasted Brioche with ricotta, blueberry preserves and lemon. This was served cold, not really my fav dish and overpriced.3. Chilaquiles, a traditional Mexican dish, served with eggs and avocado, well cooked  but was too spicy for me.4.

The fries were fresh and crispy. But the burger is just so-so. The beef is a bit dried and overall it just tasted like normal burger.

139,Congress Restaurant,Wan Chai,Chinese,3.6,123.8,0.0,"My ex-colleagues recommend this salad lunch because they know I ate too much during this HK trip.The lunch includes unlimited access on rolls, soup, and salad.  It also came with a hot/iced beverage at no additional charges.  They are charging about HK$120 per head during the lunch hours, 12:00 ~ 14:30.  They offer over 6 kinds of rolls.  All are not bad and warm enough to enjoy. There are two types of soup, western and chinese.  The chinese soup is about carrot and pork clear soup while the western one is seafood soup with tomato base.  Both are not bad as a ""buffet\' soup.The salad bar is smaller than I expected but it had quite alot of greens and cold meats.  All greens and leaves are fresh with above average quality.  Beets and olives are my favorite with greens.  They have two chefs to handle the salad tossing.  My first bowl of salad is mainly all types of greens, kidney beans, beets, and red onions.  My vinaigrette is a mixture of lemon olive oil and vinegar.  [I am not fans of traditioanl sauces such as thousand islands or ranch ... etc.] Finally, I added tons of almond, olives, and raisins for extra texture.  Of course, it didn\'t disappointed me!My second bowl of salad is a simple ceasar salad, simply add romaine lettuce and have it passed to the chef for tossing.  The chef will add the caesar salad dressing, parmesan cheese, and bread crumbs.  It\'s too simple and easy to make and I surly have no complaint!After two bowls of salad, I am almost 99% full!  So, we went for the beverage.  We choose hot coffee and iced lemon tea.  Then, finish the whole meal with a sense of well being.Rolls & soup0Rolls & soupFirst bowl of salad0First bowl of saladmy friend\'s first bowl of salad0my friend\'s first bowl of saladSoup0Soup', 'This was my first time here and I was quite shocked by the size of the restaurant. Walking in you see an open-style kitchen with counters for the buffet, and proceed further there is many tables for guests. For todays lunch I decided to visit my friend D who was working in the area.Lunch at Congress is straight-forward. You can choose the salad or noodle buffet ($105 each), have both for an extra $35, or have either plus one from the main courses list for an extra $35. Seeing it was my first time here, I went for the salad and noodle buffet to sample as much as I can. Meal began with a heart-warming soup  there was a Chinese pork-based soup, and cream of pumpkin. Both were simple, light and tasty. Bread rolls were pretty good too, I particularly like the black sesame roll =).Next was the salad bar where there was a variety of salad leaves for you to pick from, including butter lettuce, mesclun mix, romaine lettuce etc etc. For toppings you can expect the regular salad-bar items, e.g. corn, chick peas, kidney beans, diced chicken, diced ham, artichokes, cherry tomatoes, mushrooms and heart of palms. There were several dressings for you to choose from, before you end up at the salad bowl where two chefs were at your disposal to help you mix everything up nicely! Oh yes, and dont forget to help yourself to one of those crunchy thin breadsticks!The noodle station was our next stop, with four soup bases and an abundance of vegetables, seafood, meats and noodles for you to pick from. Between us we sampled the clear Japanese mushroom broth, Pork bone soup and the relatively light laksa soup bases. Simple but hearty and filling! (Note: ramen noodles in laksa broth makes a very yummy bowl of noodles.)After a bowl of salad and noodles I was very satisfied indeed, but I couldnt help to wonder if I should have went for one of the main courses? Tandoori cod fish had caught my eye but decided against it since chefs here were Chinese. For the fantastic harbour view, relaxed atmosphere (we sat chatting until 3pm!) and the flexibility of combining set lunches, this is definitely a place I will return to!for original post, see http://gastronomerr.blogspot.com/2010/07/congress-restaurant-at-convention.htmld.i.y salad0d.i.y saladlaksa0laksa', 'Had lunch there...  you can either choose Noodle or Salad or both...I am a greedy pig so i chose both... hee hee...Lots of fresh veg at the salad stand and they have the chill metal bowl which can mix the salad...

I have the thai beef curry with rice, very yummy indeed.  But maybe the curry was too tasty, a mosquito flew into the curry in the middle of my meal!!!!My friends had the tandoori salmon and the noodles.  I tried a bit of the salmon, very nicely done, as the fish was still very tender, just right.  The noodles looked fine to me.

140,Cornucopia Fine Dining,Causeway Bay,Chinese,4.3,150.0,,"0Located in the Cubus building in Causeway Bay, Cornucopia Fine Dining serves high quality Chinese food in a grand and opulent setting. The gold and red decor was both traditional and classy especially with several Chinese lion heads adorning the walls. As the restaurant was highly recommended by a foodie friend, we came here to try their dim sum for lunch with high anticipation, and we were not disappointed!0Goose Liver Paste & Abalone Tart ($48) - the dim sum was impressive from the start with this creative tart that came with a goose liver filling and topped off with a small abalone and sauce. The goose liver paste was rich and packed with flavors while the abalone was soft and chewy! Even the pastry tart was perfection with its buttery flavors. [5/5]0Guava & Scallops Dumplings ($48) - these dumplings were gorgeous to look at with its spring-like colors! I was intrigued by the unique combination of guava and scallops, and they were delightful together as the flavors were light and exquisite. If only the flavor of guava was stronger, this would be another perfect dish. [4/5]0Supreme Classic Shrimp Dumplings ($48) - the shrimp dumpling is a classic dish that must be ordered every time at dim sum! Wrapped in a thin dumpling skin, the fillings were delicious as the shrimps were simply juicy and ravishing to feast on. [4.5/5]0Steamed Hand-made Rice Rolls with Minced Beef ($52) - this was one of the best steamed rice rolls I've ever had! We couldn't help but stop to admire the transparent top layer of the rice roll when it was first brought out to the table. The rice roll was flawless as it was thin and smooth while the minced beef with dried tangerine peel was a heavenly combination. [5/5]0Ox Tongue with Black Pepper ($48) - the ox tongue was different from what I'd imagined as it was soft and tender instead of the usual chewy texture at Japanese yakitori places. The flavors were simple yet delightful to eat. [4/5]0Avocado Vegetarian Spring Rolls ($45) - these vegetarian spring rolls were perfectly executed with its crispy shell and delectable fillings. The addition of avocado was a fantastic choice as it infused the rolls with fresh and splendid flavors. [5/5]0Wrapped Sticky Rice with Abalone ($68) - this was one huge wrapped sticky rice packed with lots of fillings inside like abalone, chicken, and even tendon! The flavors were scrumptious and divine - so good I practically inhaled it! [5/5]0Steamed Traditional Layer Cake ($45) - compared to the savory dishes, the desserts were a bit disappointing. Our first of two desserts was this steamed thousand layer cake made with egg yolk and coconut shreds. The coconut shreds enhanced the textures while the egg yolk was a bit salty. [3.5/5]0Steamed Egg White Custard Buns ($38) - instead of the usual egg custard bun, the restaurant choose to serve a variation of it using egg white only for the custard. The result was a mixed bag - while it was lighter and healthier, the egg white custard was not as fragrant and flavorful as its normal counterpart. It was not sweet and quite bland actually for a dessert. [3/5]00Overall, the quality of the dim sum at Cornucopia was high with its creative dishes and impressive flavors! Although the prices are not cheap, the restaurant makes up for it with its elegant and quiet setting so one can enjoy dim sum without the usual noise or chaos. The kitchen has obviously got their fundamentals right with dim sum and we can't wait to try their dishes for dinner next time!""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-cornucopia-fine-dining/127810?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw
141,Craftsteak,Central,American,2.8,150.0,26.0,"Was here with 10 coworkers for a farewell lunch. The restaurant was half empty, however they still managed to take 50 mins from order to serving food. We ordered at 13:20 and the main dishes were served at 14:10. The food was disgusting. There is a tiny fly crawling on a salad. The chicken breast tasted more blend than boiled chicken I eat after workout. My friend and I both ordered a medium rare burger, however hers was almost raw and mind was fine. Another friend ordered a medium steak but it looks well-done. My friend demand to cancel the raw burger, because it was already passed our lunch hour and we cannot afford another 50 mins for another burger. And the chefs were really pissed. Like REALLY PISSED. They dead stared at us with arms crossed non stop after we cancel the raw burger. We were being polite and did not blame them for taking a decade to bring food to the table but the chefs figured they should be the one who's angry. They have charged the fee of 4 steaks instead of 3, which was wrong, and they were reluctant to cancel the bill of raw burger which my friend did't even eat. She has to get a sandwich from Seven-Eleven as a farewell lunch. This is the worst experience I've ever had in any restaurant.Supplementary InformationHSBC restaurant week"", 'We, a group of 10 people, went to Craftsteakfor lunch during the restaurant week promotion. The meal includes starter, maincourse and dessert. For the starter, choices of octopus salad or tuna withavocado ceviche which served in a small portion and both tasted okay. After thestarter, we waited for entire 40 mins for the main course to be served whichwas TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. Knowing that we all went there during limited lunchtime and the restaurant was not even full.Finally, the food came. For the steak, requiredmedium and turned out to be well done. For the chicken breast, very dry andtasteless (not enough seasoning). For the burger, it was okay, a bit dry. Also,obviously they missed one order which was the burger and it was eventuallyserved after 50 mins we placed the order. AND IT WAS RAW! We request it to becancel and the waiter took it away and talked to the chef. The chef then keptstaring at us with an angry face.This is absolutely ridiculous. We came here asthe customer and we pay for the food. Not only the food served late (after 50mins) and it was raw! And we being treated in a very rude way? Honestly, Iwouldnt come here again and I do not recommend anyone to come here unless youwant to be treated rudely and waste your entire lunch hour to wait for the foodwhich was not even good.', 'We walked in for lunch on Friday in a group of two. We could easily get a table around 12:40p.m.The interior decoration of the restaurant was pretty nice. We occupied a round table near the front door which was quite a private and quiet corner of the restaurant.Lunch Menu0Lunch MenuThere seemed to be quite a number of different options on their lunch menu. I was not hungry and went for a 2-course lunch with grilled pork neck and white tuna.Bread0BreadThe bread was served to us very soon. It was a bit weird that a waitress took away our bread plate before we had started eating the bread...The bread had very crispy and thin crust yet soft interior. It was still slightly warm when eaten. The sauce, which I suspected to be some thick mayo sauce, was quite delicious.Grilled Pork Neck with Apricot Jam0Grilled Pork Neck with Apricot JamThere were 4 slices of pork neck. Some small bits of the pork neck slices were burnt. They were all cold when served. They were not particularly pleasing but probably ok as a starter. The combo with Apricot jam was a bit funny. I preferred Thai-style pork neck with crispy slices accompanied by sweet & sour/spicy sauce.White Tuna with black olive puree and baby artichokes...0White Tuna with black olive puree and baby artichokes...The presentation was pretty nice. The white tuna itself was quite big. It was crispy outside but not tender enough. In fact, it was a bit rough. It was appreciated that some crispy toppings were added to give different textures to the fish. The black olive puree was ok although I was never a fan of olive. Overall, I would say it was ok.Overall, the quality of the food was ok with no surprises. I would say that the quality was fair given the price. Service was ok. Environment and interior decoration were quite good. Could consider coming back for lunch later but definitely not high on my to-go list.', 'We thought the food at Craftsteak was pretty good but we are very disappointed with the service at Craftsteak. I can name a number of incidents regarding their service during our short 1 hour lunch break.1. When we walked in the restaurant, the manager / waiter came straight up to us, without asking if we had a reservation and said that the restaurant is full. We told him we had a reservation and we saw an empty table right next to the door so I asked if we could sit there. He said that someone had booked that table and its unavailable. We insisted that we made a reservation and asked him to check. After checking, the manager came back to us without any response, and instead started cleaning the table and said we should sit there.We understand that there may be errors with reservations and thats fine. However, the manager could have communicated with us without banning us right away. It made us feel we were unreasonable to have wanted a table at the restaurant that we made a reservation in advance.2. When we sat down, we quickly knew what we wanted to eat and told the manager that we were ready to order. He came back and started taking our order, however, as we were sitting right next to the door, he kept welcoming guests or talking to guests at the door before he finished taking our order. Before we even started ordering, the manager told us not to chase any of our orders today, as the kitchen is really busy during lunch. We ordered 3 sets and 2 of the mains were Angus Sirloin Beef, without asking us what our preference was, he assumed that we wanted it cooked to Medium, however, we heard him mumbling and we corrected him that we wanted the steak cooked to Medium Rare. When the food came after 15 minutes, we were handed our plates that were placed in very awkward positions (e.g. I had steak, but the plate was placed vertically instead of horizontally).We understand that during lunch hours it can get very busy at the door, however, with normal respect, I think the manager should have taken our order first before serving anyone else at the door? Also, I think the manager should have explained to us in a friendlier matter that the kitchen is very busy during lunch hours, and it may take a little longer than usual for the food to be serve, rather than ask us not to chase. As a customer, I think we should have the right to ask about our food when it isnt served on time. Moreover, it may sound tedious, but I think customers should have the final choice on how they want the food to be served, an assumption is not acceptable. Finally, I think its basic etiquette that a server should have to place food in the right position for their customers at a western restaurant.3. During the meal, we realized that we werent given napkins nor were we given bread for the whole meal. We chased another Chinese waitress for the bread, but were not responded with good attitude. The waitress acknowledged with the slightest nod and no smile on her face at all. Also, we chased her twice, but neither the napkins nor the bread came in the end.I would have expected that a restaurant under Dining Concepts should have sufficient training on how to act in a restaurant, even during the busiest hours. Its ok to forget something, but I would expect an apology and also a smile on her face?4. Finally, I highly appreciate that Dining Concepts will match our donation of $1 on our final bill, but I think it would be great if the manager could have explained to us the extra $1 on our bill first and not just handing it over (without a smile) and looking impatient.We had high expectations with restaurants under Dining Concepts, and we were glad that the food quality at Craftsteak wasnt bad. However, with the service provided, we believe theres definitely room for improvement and we hope we would not be getting the same level of service the next time we visit.', ""I have been to this restaurant quite a few times as I used to be addicted to their French Onion Soup (one of the most delicious ones I've tasted). I cannot believe that this restaurant would get so many negative comments as I have always loved this restaurant. However, I have only come during lunchtime and never for dinner. From what I can tell, the lunch is more expensive than other sets in Soho, but it is also much nicer in both presentation, taste and atmosphere.The restaurant is decorated very nicely with barn doors and mirrors to make it appear more spacious. It is very clean and hygienic and has a high-class look. The service is polite, nice and quite fast (at that time, there were only three tables with customers). Warm Mushroom and Spinach SaladThis dish was quite delicious, although it is hard to get it wrong. The spinach is fresh and plentiful, while the mushrooms tasted great, very juicy. There are also some slices of roasted peppers that worked very well with the rest of the dish. There was also a sauce, which although I cannot remember what it was, I can remember it had a slightly tangy taste to it. Craftsteak BurgerA very large burger! Be sure you are hungry when you order this dish (I was!). The bun was nicely toasted on the grill (as seen by the char marks). The actual beef itself was very juicy and a considerable amount, so I think it is worth the money. The bacon added a smokey flavor while the Swiss cheese mellowed the dish out. The only problem was that there was no way to eat the burger in one bite like that, so I had to split it in half to fit it in my mouth. However, I must say, this burger was very delicious and worth the calories. Pecan Pie with Maple Ice CreamThe pecan pie is served cold, which I didn't like as much. I prefer warm desserts, but I have never eaten pecan pie before and am unsure whether it should be served warm or cold. Nevertheless, it tasted very nice; the pecans were crunchy and sweet while the bottom layer was smooth, creamy and buttery. I did not really enjoy the crust as it was too 'buttery' and left a too-rich feeling in my mouth. The maple ice cream was delicious, although I would have preferred a stronger maple flavor.Overall, I believe Craftsteak is one of Soho's most excellent restaurants and, despite the bad claims, one must give it a try. As most people seem to have problems during dinnertime, I would suggest coming for lunch if possible.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-craftsteak/16648?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

143,Cross Cafe,Causeway Bay,Chinese,2.8,80.0,0.0,"Trappist Dairy is a brand of milk from Hong Kong that originally came from the Trappist Monastery on Lantau Island in Hong Kong. But now they have since expanded to a major factory some where else. Along with the changing times, they have also expanded from just bottles to milk to now yogurt, flavored milks and now a cha chan teng. (English name: Cross Cafe) was originally in the Western District but now has expanded with a few other locations. The newest one is in Causeway Bay. As it's part of the Trappist Dairy, they offer the option of ordering a bottle of Trappist milk. They even have soft serve ice cream. That's pretty cool.0The restaurant is fairly big and has a retro design. Menu is in English and Chinese. There is no 10% service charge. But they didn't appear to have too many set meals. Mostly it was a la carte.0I ordered the macaroni in tomato ox-tail soup with black truffle scrambled egg and toast set ($62). The toast was buttered with bits of truffle as well. It was a bit too much truffle for my liking so it sort of made me shudder. The egg was scrambed ok. Fairly soft and fluffy.0This was really good. Portion size was huge. The tomato soup was rich and strong. It was more like a borscht. The macaroni was soft but not mushy. There were two pieces of lovely soft ox tail.0I upgraded my drink to a signature vanilla caramel milkshake for $18. This was just plain terrible and I should have just stuck to a regular drink instead of upgrading. Probably the best was the crispy pretzel and that was store bought. It was just ice and milk. There was no taste of vanilla. The small drizzle of caramel sauce was just not enough. Definitely skip this item. I don't know how this can be the signature.0Price was pretty steep for a cha chan teng. The macaroni dish was really good and I'd probably go back for that. But it wasn't cheap so I may go some where else. I came on a weekend so I wonder if they have more set meal options during the weekday? Or is this just an over priced cha chan teng?""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-cross-cafe/570114?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
144,Crystal Jade La Mian Xiao Long Bao,Admiralty,Chinese,3.5,138.0,0.0,"I went there for lunch with 3 other friends. Food quality was not bad. As I think they\'ve adjusted for the taste of HK people, the food there was not as sweet as the authentic Shanghai food that one can get in Shanghai.:Pretty good.

I like the texture of the noodleswhich was prettychewy.:Very good. Yummy.:Pretty good. It\'s nicely done as the fried rice was dry enough. In terms of taste, it\'s just a little bit bland. Would be perfect with a pinch of salt or soya sauce or some dried ham.:Not bad. Pretty standard. Nothing special.:Pretty good. Not oily at all which was good. There\'s nothing I can complain about the food. Could have been a perfect place for lunch in Admiralty as pricing was not too high. Unfortunately, service was unbelievably terrible. When we were half way through the lunch, a young waitor in a pair of black plastic-framed glasses came to our table. His uniform was a bit different from the other waitors so maybe he\'s a supervisor or something. He checked our bill and said, ""has your food all arrived as you\'ve to return the table soon."" Then my friend said, ""your colleaguedidn\'t mention that we\'ve to return the table so quicklywhen we were seated. We still want to order dessert."" Then the young supervisor said in a pretty rude attitude, ""I\'m sure my colleague had already told you when you were seated."" Then my friend said, ""Your colleague actually didn\'t mention that."" To be honest, we would not argue if the receptionist did tell us to return the table but she really didn\'t as I was also there. Then the young waitor said in an even more rude manner, ""I\'m sure my colleague did tell you but I don\'t want to argue with you any more!"" He walked away and brought a few new customers in and arranged them to sit next to us. He then yelled loudly toall ofus in a sarcastic tone, Sorry to make you wait for soooooooo longggggg as other customers are not willing to leave.. To be honest, we all understood that we were not eating at the Four Seasons Hotel and we would return the table as soon as we finish our food. After all, we all had to head back to work right? But the young supervisor was way too rude especially the yelling in the end. He\'s so uncivilised.After all, Crystal Jades food is pretty good but it just needs to put more effort into training especially when they are opening more and more restaurants. Poor service could ruin the brand very quickly.

145,Crystal Jade La Mian Xiao Long Bao,Causeway Bay,Chinese,3.8,95.0,,"This is my first time visiting this Crystal Jade since they reopened their restaurant in WTC. The new location is on the 4th floor now and is smaller than their previous location on the 2nd floor. They still have a nice view of the harbor but the floor plan is now an L shape, which makes it harder to flag down a staff as you basically have to wait for them to walk by your area. Still, the restaurant is bright and airy which makes for a nice and comfortable place to have a meal.0We came here for lunch as we usually do. We like this location as there usually isn\'t any lines and the seating here is spacious and tidy. There were still plently of spots at 12:30pm so maybe people don\'t know that they have reopended already. The menu is still the same. For lunch, we usually like to order some appetizers and one of their handmade ""la mian"" noodles. On this day, we ordered the xiao lung bao, drunken chicken, and the la mian noodles with beef in spicy soup.Menu2MenuMenu0MenuMenu0MenuMenu0Menu1) Drunken Chicken ($60) - the drunken chicken came first. While I thought the temperature was a bit too cold even though it\'s supposed to be a cold dish, the flavor made up for it in that you can taste the Shaoxing wine but yet it was not overpowering. The wine was well soaked into the chicken meat and skin so it was quite flavorful in general. Only complaint is that the portion is a tad small for $60 bucks.Drunken Chicken0Drunken Chicken2) ""La Mian"" Noodles with Beef in Spicy Soup ($65) - beware this a 3 stars spicy! It\'s actually pretty spicy so only order this dish if you can usually eat spicy food. The bowl of noodle soup is actually big enough to share between 2 people or for 1 person if you do not order appetizers. The soup base for this noodle is similar to Szechuan beef in hot chili oil. The beef is soft and tender while the soup is spicy and numbing. The noodles are thin yet chewy and was cooked just right. It has also soaked up a bit of the spicy soup so it was yummy to eat. (A little trick I use to combat the spiciness to add a bit of the vinegar for the xiao lung bao to the soup. Actually made the soup really tasty!)\'\'La Mian\'\' noodles with beef in spicy soup0\'\'La Mian\'\' noodles with beef in spicy soup3) Steamed Pork Dumplings ""Shanghai"" Style ($36) - The xiao lung bao arrived piping hot. I love the xiao lung bao here and I think it\'s one of the best in HK - much better than Ding Tai Fung as I thought the ones at DTF were a bit small, skin was thicker, and with less soup. The ones here are all around excellent - decent in size, the skin is thin yet strong enough to hold the soup (never had an incident of spilling the soup because of ripped skin yet!), and lots of soup. The pork inside was soft and tender, and the soup was rich and flavorful.Steamed pork dumplings \'\'Shanghai\'\' style1Steamed pork dumplings \'\'Shanghai\'\' styleSee the soup?Steamed pork dumplings \'\'Shanghai\'\' style0Steamed pork dumplings \'\'Shanghai\'\' styleOverall, the dishes arrives very fast so it\'s perfect for a quick lunch or if you would like to take your time as well.

I particularly love the smooth and meshy texture that the dish brought. The noodle bowl was like those rice in soup which the noodles was soaked until very soft. Perhaps it was the best food for babies since it was very easily chewable. The soup itself was pretty savoury and had a mild taste of chicken.

The dumpling skin was quite thin, but there wasn't much soup within the dumpling. The meat was not savoury enough. Although it is one of the signature dish, I would not recommend it.Pretty much soupless dumplings0Pretty much soupless dumplings4) Ramen in Hot and Sour Soup $46Just by imagining the dish had already got four of us excited. It fulfilled two of our wishes, combining a main dish, noodles, and lovely hot and sour soup. The hot and sour soup was very savory! Simply by drinking the soup would make all of us totally satisfy. The spiciness and the sourness was made suitable, and there were lots of ingredients such as minced beef, spring onions and mushroom in the soup. The mushrooms were fat and fresh, and was extremly juicy and tasty with the essence of the soup fully concentrated into the mushroom. The noodles on the other hand was at normal chewy-ness, not particularly soft even after it was soaked in the soup for a while.delicious hot and spicy soup with al dente ramen0delicious hot and spicy soup with al dente ramen5) Fried Rice Flour Cake with Diced Ham, Corn and Vegetable Cube $58This dish waz quite interesting. The rice flour cake was diced to little cubes, as well as other ingredients in the dish. The taste in general was nice, it was in suitable saltyness. The rice flour cake was cooked until chewy, however the rice flour cake was not flesh at all. I have been having Shanghainese food since forever as my grandparents were both Shanghainese. Hence I would literally tell whether the rice flour cake source was nice or not, which unfortunately was a no for Crystal Jade. Rice Flour Cake not fresh at all0Rice Flour Cake not fresh at allIn general it was quite a good bargain to dine in Crystal Jade. The price was inexpensive and the portions was pretty generous. I was actually quite surprise by the tiny price difference between the appetizers and the main dish, perhaps they should adjust the price a bit? The food quality on the other hand was fine but not particularly nice, yet given the price and portion I wouldn't mind to dine here from time to time.www.cinnamon4coffee.blogspot.com""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/wan-chai-crystal-jade-la-mian-xiao-long-bao/18394?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw
147,Crystal Sky,Wan Chai,Japanese,3.7,150.0,0.0,"This place is alwaysbustling during lunch time so we were very happy to find a table upon arrival with no reservation. There are a range of different lunch set options, a lot of them less than HK$100 each, with fresh sushi/sashimi, udon noodles and the like. My favorite is always the avocado salad, and the tiny cups of steamed eggs with fresh seafood in them are just the best kind of comfort food. The seafood tempura are always a good choice--sizzling with oil on top, the crispy outside and the fresh juicy seafood on the inside are best enjoyed fresh from the kitchen. The service seems a little rushe and no-frills--the orders came slowly and at different times, and it took a couple of tries to get water refilled, but then, for a quick lunch, it's acceptable. The place is dark, so when it's a million degrees and incredibly sunny outside in Wanchai, it's a nice spot to hide from all the heat and enjoy a Japanese food fix.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/wan-chai-crystal-sky/506567?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

Nice clean small noodle shop, Well, it is a ramen shop~ what do you expect~ they are basically a Fast food place. The waiter to customer ratio was about 22 customers to 4 floor persons, 3 kitchen guys.Just like Rolls Royce engines.  it is adequateNOW look at the price. About 60- 80 a bowl. But bad.The topping are ranging 8  15 dollars, and the Snacks are about 18- 35 HKD.HOW about Drinks you say? Well, 12 for Oolong tea and 65 for a REAL SAKE. We Had Water. ( Well, It is a noodle Bar, NOT a real bar. )Still I think is Fair priced.I have to say, my photos were not professionally done and they dont do justice for the food.Couple things,1) The Tofu with Semi Cooked Egg was great! Very good on visual too. AND It is actually Sweet Bean Sauce and Sesame sauce with some Sesame on top~ You know the ones you put on Stinky tofu? Thats EXACTLY that~ It goes together well, and, Of course they are higher grade stuff, but the whole time, I was thinking  If there were some MISO with the Tofu If there is some Miso now It might work.2) The dumplings are FAIR. It took some time for them to cook ( about 20 mins ) they are not the garlicky taste like the ones I am used too. Just NORMAL dumplings.3) The Noodles, I ordered the pork+ fish stock mega noodle and my wife ordered the Pork stock XXX mountain thing.Pork + Fish stock is relatively light and I like the taste of it. NOT SALTY and NOT overly Spiced. NOT REFREASHING thou, but I think it is a good balance which I can eat .. well, 2-3 times a week. ( Some shops you could only have once a month cos too oily and Savory) , and The Char Siu is a bit rough , but I can live with it.My Wifes Raman is a mountain, a mountain of noodles and onions and Vegi. The Stock got some porky taste to it ( Well, the other post mentioned it too) BUT IT IS NOT AS BAD as they said. Just take some pepper and it would take the soup to another level, and make you happy.It is just a comfortable meal. It is very hard to find a Raman shop these days. Something thats not over kill in taste ~The noodles are one of those pre seasoned oil yellow noodles, thicker and usually use for thick heavy stocks. Best part is that I dont need to Run to 7-11 to buy a stick of gum to kick the after taste out of my mouth. It is something Me and My wife can live with.NOW I Really think this shop is operated by a someone who appreciate food with a lighter taste. These days a lot of shops are FILLING the menu with Pork stock thats SO heavy and thick you could glue wallpapers with them.

Maybe is new open.However, seems like many things needed to add $$. End up is not cheap at all.', 'We walked by Daimenko on the way to the old Wanchai Police Station and thought we\'d give it a try another day.  What a pleasant surprise!  Should have come back last week instead of waste our meal at some random restaurant nearby this one...  I have had these ""rickshaw noodles"" a couple of times before and was not very impressed.  But I am a fan now.  I think this place just ""started"" and are trying out their new operations, since their menus are still printed on A4 paper and just sticky taped onto the counter at this time.  They have digital menus and not a whole lot of instruction on how to order.  However, it is not exactly rocket science to order a bowl of noodles and we figured it out soon enough.  It was like ordering a salad or a pizza, except in this case, you order your noodles and pick your toppings.  The cashier was not very friendly and did not appear very familiar with their computer system, so we took like a minute to place our order.  Once we ordered and paid, we were told to take a seat and pick up the noodles when they were ready.  I was surprised they only accepted Octopus, which was great for me since I do not like carrying coins.  The restaurant offers free seating using stools and the ""tacky"" street furniture.  But on second thought, this actually went well nicely.  I think the owners are proud of the heritage of their noodles and you can see a big poster of an old market food stall in the middle of the restaurant, probably of their old shop back in the day.  I was told by my friend that this used to be a street food, hence the furniture I guess, which is appropriate.Shortly after we picked a spot, our ticket was called (probably around 2 minutes after we paid) and we had to get up again to go get our noodles.  Our noodles came in a stylish white Daimenko bowl with a handle, which we thought was pretty neat.  This is where things started getting better.  I ordered my own combo including: Chicken Wings, Soy Egg, Beef Brisket and Curry Squid with Inaniwa Udon.  My friend ordered some ""dirty street hawker noodle"", which according to him, is the traditional favourite.  I passed on it because it included pork intestine which I am not that eager to try. I started by eating the Chicken Wings.  I will tell you that I have a bias as I generally like eating chicken wings and order it even when I go to Mcdonald\'s...  That said, you wouldn\'t believe it, this is probably one of the BEST chicken wings I have had, a la Chinese style at a noodle shop in Hong Kong.  The wings had the usual soy flavour which is good although not very strong - but the texture was PERFECT.  The Soy Egg was nice and had a soft yolk.  Beef was good and so was the curry squid.  I also ordered a fresh pear juice, which was nice.The portions were just right and not very big.  Some guys might like to have a ""bigger"" bowl of noodles, but I liked this size (as it left me ""satisfied"" with sufficient space for a dessert and not feeling very stuffed).  As for my friend, he liked the dirty street hawker noodle he had.  Although he said the spicy soup could be ""hotter"", it was a good amount so that he could taste the other ingredients.My friend tells me that my bowl of noodles was relatively pricey, but not expensive, given that a bowl of Inaniwa Udon would cost like 80-200 dollars at a Japanese restaurant.  He thinks his bowl was good value at 33 dollars with like 5 toppings, especially for Wanchai.  For me, I can simply say that I would pay 80-100 dollars for a bowl of noodles that looks like this and I ended up paying 50, so I am a happy camper.We originally thought Daimenko was just another ramen place, but it is not.  It is truly a Hong Kong noodle shop and much more than just a ""ramen place"" - even though they serve ramen too.  It is not fair to benchmark this place using my New York ""Zagat"" comparison since this is not western food, but I would recommend this place to anyone who would like to have a delicious bowl of Hong Kong style noodles - without having to go to some dumpy, back alley shop with a 30 minute wait.  Just goes to show that in Hong Kong, one can still ""get lucky"" like we did, just walking into an unknown shop.  Maybe Daimenko could do with a little music?  But like I said many times before, the most important thing about a restaurant is the food and this place has what it takes to bring me back for another bowl.Great Chicken Wings0Great Chicken WingsDirty Street Hawker Noodles1Dirty Street Hawker Noodles'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/wan-chai-daimenko/118866?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

The restaurant is clearly very family orientated with a lot of children, so if you don't like noise, don't go~ Since we were not too hungry, we ordered a clam chowder and a philly cheese sandwich to share. Once we sat down, a glass of water and bread was offered. The bread basket consists of two slices of baguette, two chocolate muffins and a dark roll of some sort (didn't ended up eating it). The bread itself was filling enough for us, it is def good if you have children and want to occupy them... The clam chowder came inside a round roll, the soup itself was really nice, but the bread was stale so it was a bit of a waste...The philly cheese sandwich came in a hot dog bun, not sure if this is authentic but I personally didn't like it. The meat was also a bit tasteless and the cheese wasn't really nice either... The only nice thing about it was the chips, freshly cut and crispy... The lunch was really average, but might go back to try burgers instead...

My dad said he wanted to eat the signature muffin here (see how we are going to a place for its muffin),and so we went without making any advanced bookings.We arrived at around one forty five and were a little shocked to see so many empty tables at the place. I remember that years back then when the economy was better, this place used to be so packed during weekend lunchtimes, and we had to either make advanced bookings or wait until our names were called. Gone were the days of economic prosperity - and as a matter of fact Dan Ryan's is quite an accurate 'thermometer' of the economic situation in Hong Kong. During the bad times of SARS we went here for lunch and the place was completely empty. I remember going here for a Xmas dinner before SARS took place and it was once again full with celebrating families although it charged not low for a xmas dinner package. So I have to confess that the present scene with few customers in the restaurant is a bit frightening indeed...Still, people got to eat no matter how bad the economy is,right?  We looked at the breakfast menu (which is quite different from the all day menu, quite a number of dishes are missing and replaced by the all-day breakfast section,including the risotto), and settled with some familiar and tasty dishes that we always order: a normal portion of Caesar Salad at $108, a cup Chili at $38, a Lasagna at $158 and a burger from the 'signature hamburger selection' - the Hummus Fungus Burger(Beef burger with mixed mushroom and Swiss cheese) which came with a cup soup of the day at $148, which was Onion Soup.The Bread Basket that never let one down1The Bread Basket that never let one down First came the much anticipated  Bread Basket: the content of the complimentary selection of bread has changed quite a lot over the years, but the signature muffin was, is, and hopefully will always be there. No wonder why - the muffin is truly magical! It's not exactly of a chocolate flavour despite its brownish color; with chewy chopped walnuts, flaxseeds and a fluffy texture, which is not too wet nor too dry, neither too spongy nor too hard, the consistency of the high quality is actually scary! But oh my, it tastes so good that it is capable of comforting one's soul, and I am not even exaggerating. This is basically the only muffin that i will happily eat in bites after bites without feeling guilty at all in town. The other buns in the bread basket are also excellent - there were three types and all of them are equally fresh and tasty. There was this plain white 'piggy bun' which has a crunchy crust and a soft texture - my ma's favourite. Next there was a darkish bun which might be cocoa in flavour.  The Wholesomely delicious mini wholewheat bun0The Wholesomely delicious mini wholewheat bunLast there was the wholewheat bun which was really nice - the outside was crunchy and the interior was not too wet. It went extremely well with the pipped soft butter which is another complimentary magic at Dan Ryan's - it was so good that we actually asked for two more of the buns! Caesar salad0Caesar salad After stuffing ourselves with the yummy bread and muffins the Caesar salad arrived. The veggies were nicely tossed and the dressing was of the appropriate flavour and consistency.  The tomato wedges were fleshy and fresh - yummy! Onion Soup and Chili(Cup size)0Onion Soup and Chili(Cup size) Chili is another must-have for our family meals at Dan Ryan's. A hearty side cooked with kidney beans, tomato sauce, hot sauce and tuna flakes, it tasted best when eaten with crackers. It also tastes well when eaten with any red pasta or hamburger patties too! The onion soupis clear in colour-the carmelized onion flakes were sweet as hell and we could not help but usrp the thing within minutes! The cracker did not go well with the soup however - some oyster crackers would be better.Lasagna0Lasagna The  Lasagna is what my dad calls the 'best in town'. Cooked with a thick and rich tomato sauce and formaggi sauce, the Lasagna is a truly comforting dish. Homey and hearty, spoonfuls of this pasta comforts your unsettled soul and calms your mind.  Yummy tomato sauce, Cheese sauce and Lasagna0Yummy tomato sauce, Cheese sauce and Lasagna The garlic bread which came with it did not taste as good as they were in the past however - a little too chewy and soggy for me. Hummus Fungus(?) Burger0Hummus Fungus(?) BurgerThe Hummus Fungusis basically the classic burger with mixed mushrooms and swiss cheese. Charcoal-grilled beef patty, Cheesy Mushrooms..0Charcoal-grilled beef patty, Cheesy Mushrooms..It didnt taste much difference however, as the swiss cheese tasted more or less the same as plain cheddar. The mixed mushrooms were pretty tasteless as well. As for the charcoal-grilled beef patty, I can see why it is controversial whether what you get at Dan Ryan's can be classified as 'tasty' or not as, to be flank, this patty is rather bland and dry when compared to what's served at Burgeroom. But this has the distinct aroma from the charcoal grill, and the texture of a rough yet 'tough' beef - very American indeed. The cabbages, tomatoes and onion were fresh, and I especially loved the coleslaw and fries which came with the burger - the first being sour and refreshing, and the latter being thick, fat and juicy-authentically potato-ish! All in all, Dan Ryan's is a place we will return again and again for simple yet hearty meals. You probably wont get much pleasant surprises here with the constantly similar menu, but you will never be disappointed by what's served at your table."", ""my family is a usual customer at dan ryans - i remembered my first visit so well that i actually still had what i ordered by then in mind(haha). i remember i was given a mask of Bill Clinton as a toy for the kids(therefore exposing my real age perhaps?) and i ordered a spaghetti with meat balls from the kid's menu. fast forwarding my memory, i remembered eating a piece of awful turkey breast here during christmas. that was some years ago, i think, for my parents have now ditched the habit of paying a (relatively) large sum of money for plates of horrible turkey and christmas foods we actually dont like eating for the sake of celebrating christmas.nevertheless, my family and i are somehow 'in love' with this restaurant-we go here everytime we cant think of a better place to eat. the food here might not be the best in town, but it has the magnetic force which pulls us back to pay it a visit again, and again, and again, just to order the dish which taste is so memorable. and eating there is always comfortable, maybe its because of the cozy atmosphere, or perhaps the portion of food (which is always good for share), or even because of the amount of fat used in cooking. i guess that's what comfort food means.anyways, today we decided to go here for lunch. we arrived after 1:30 and the place was packed with families spending their early afternoon with a family brunch. after 5 mins of wait we were allocated to a table, and ordered:caesar salad;soup of the day(chicken noodle soup);cup of chili;linguine with white clam sauce;club sandwich.the bread basket came first. there were three buns and two muffins, all hot off the warmer. i especially appreciate the darker (rye?) bun for i love eating chewy buns. it had a detectable smell of burnt which i thought was not a defect but done deliberately. it went well with the creamy butter. Needless to mention was the muffin which is always tasty when i eat here- the varying texture with walnuts, choco chips and the muffin bread was just so balancedly amazing!the dishes were all huge in size! caesar came in a long plate which chinese people might consider to use to steam a whole fish. the romaine lettuce were chopped to size fit for one-bite, and it was tossed to the extent that the dressing, cheese and veggies had all mixed so well with each other. the crumbs of croutons were fresh and crunchy, and the tomatoes fleshy and juicy. the caesar dressing is also one of the best we have tried in town! matter of fact the caesar here is so well-loved by us its a must-have everytime we eat here!next came the rest of the dishes- the chili came with crackers. i dipped the crackers into the chili which actually didnt taste hot-with beans, meat and tuna, it resembled Bolognese to a large extent(haha). the pasta was alright-not too dry and the sauce was thick and creamy, the clams were quite fresh too. but i personally did not prefer the pasta to be cooked until soo soft-something al dante will be my cup of tea.the club sandwich was huge! with three layers of toasted wheat bread, two layers of turkey ham, tomatoes, lettuce and bacon, its portion was something beyond the capacity of a normal chinese. i had to open my mouth to its widest to bite into the quarter of sandwich, which was disappointedly a little too dry on the edge as there was no dressing whatsoever but hardcore meat and veggie. nonetheless the tomatoes were fleshy and juicy so it complemented the lack of juice in the sandwich. the infinite layers of ham was not too salty and tasted good too! and oh, the fries that came with the sandwich were also one of the best in town-they were thick, and potato-ish with skins still on, and they were not too mushy in the middle. dipping one after another in the ketchup, i could hardly stop myself from eating! the colesaw which came with the sandwich was also wonderful, being not too sour but sour enough to be commented as 'refreshing'. eating at dan ryans had always been, and will always be, a pleasing experience. i believe that my family will come here as frequently as we had in the past few years, ordering the similar dishes which we feel comfortable with.......although im a little tempted to explore the all-day breakfast menu i looked at today next time, perhaps by ordering the egg benedict here for a try...yum yum! bread basket with the must-eat muffin0bread basket with the must-eat muffinlinguine with white clam sauce; caesar salad0linguine with white clam sauce; caesar saladchili0chiliclub sandwich0club sandwichlayers of ham, tomatoes and bacon0layers of ham, tomatoes and bacon"", 'Business Meal Set costs HKD88 only, not expensive, thus I chose this place for a nice lunch with friends or colleagues!We ordered the below dishes to share for 2 gals only this time!

Pretty decent prices considering the portion size, location, and quality of food. Food:  Ordered the Beef & Tomatoes Fettuccine ($148) with Beef & vegetables soup.  Friend ordered the Tuna Melt.  Meal came with nice batch of bread (best bread I have yet to try in these American restaurants!  Came with 2 dark nutty slightly sweet muffins (still warm) and small onion roll and raisin roll (both still warm) with soft butter on the side.  So good - we ate everything....even though I try to abstain from eating so much bread to avoid filling my stomach up before the actual meal...and to avoid so much initial carbs.  But this can be an exception since the bread was SO good. Beef & vegetables soup was delicious.  It came with good amounts of vegetables with beef broth (didn't notice any actual beef meat) but I'd preferred it the way it came because it was so tasty and light. Also came with few saltines to crush into the soup.  Beef & Tomatoes Fettuccine tasted very similar to Union Bar's Tripoline dish.  Only difference is that Dan Ryan's version is just the fettuccine noodle whereas Union has 3 types of noodles.  Came with big chunks of tomatoes and small pieces of tender beef in a tomato cream sauce.  HUGE portion that I gasped when it arrived.  Also served with two slices of toasted garlic bread!  Tuna melt:  Came with large thick cut french fries, half a pickle and coleslaw.  Served open-faced with the swiss and chedder cheese melting on top.  Tuna was mixed in with pieces of egg and not that heavy mayo (which I appreciated).  Served on top of toasty thick slice of rye bread.  Very very good!  Fries were freshly fried and also delish.  Service:  Pretty good service.  Can wave down any waiter.  Saw a group of moms with babies that were seated - the waiters promptly brought the baby chairs and crayons/color paper for the babies. Sizing it up:  Dan Ryan's definitely exceeded my expectations for American food.  I was so glad I came.  Its part of the Union Bar group, so similar atmosphere, but Dan Ryan's is slightly more casual than Union.  The food is done very well here that hits the spot/craving for your American foods.  HUGE portions is what I need to emphasize, I ended up bringing home the rest of my pasta.  A definite try when you're in the Pacific Place area.  Also, huge spacious seating - great for big families and groups."", ""Again, I went here with a friend!

We had the truffle har gau, the black garlic siu mai, the char siu bao, the dan dan xialong bao, the grouper fillet dumpling and the foie gras taro dumpling. The best was the truffle har gau. The essence of the truffle came through without overwhelming the har gau. The black garlic siu mai was a pleasant surprise as the sweetness of the black garlic complemented the sweetness of the shrimp. The dan dan xialong bao sounds better than it tasted. It reminded me of kimchi for some reason. I think the original/crab roe version is superior. The grouper dumpling was a bit fishy despite the strong ginger. The foie gras taro dumpling is definitely a miss. Deep fried foie gras is just overkill in richness and gets suffocated in the heaviness of the taro.Like many other HK restaurants, the service needs a lot of improvement. This is my second attempt at eating at DSL. When I went a couple of weeks ago, I didn\'t have a booking and was told that it was fully booked at 12:15. However, the restaurant was at least 1/3 empty. The hostess said that the bookings were for 12:30 and they were going to be packed! We said we\'d wait, but they told us that the wait was ""very long"". I asked for specific time and they just repeated \'very long.\' Interestingly, they told the couple who came right before me (who also had no booking) to just wait for the next table.  That couple had called and were told to just come they\'ll be seated. I asked whether I should just call them so they\'ll tell me the same thing rather than ""very long"" wait.My second time around, I made a booking so didn\'t have to wait. But there was a couple who got there before me without a booking and were told by the hostess that the place is ""fully booked"". It was 2/3 empty. We were seated in the back and there was a whole other section further back that was completely empty. The couple in front of us were peeved and the hostess told them to wait for bar seating. This is just so bizarre. Why is DSL turning away business?!!! Even when I left at 12:15 it was barely 2/3 full. But they were still turning away people!! Why???!!'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/admiralty-dim-sum-library/517915?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

But trust me, a lot of them is like home-made food or its just something to fill your stomach. Thats one of the reasons I don\'s go to Chinese cuisine that often. But here, whatever you order, they will not disappoint you. 0Fried Spinach, its freshly picked and yummy.0Beef tendon with noodles (plain soup base) you will like it if you love simple and plain dishes.0The famous dumplings. Its their signature dish. i wonder what they do to make the skin so thin and still able to hold the juice inside. It will need a scientist to explain it. Must try! You will regret otherwise.0Finally the sesame bum. Its nicely made and filled with sesame aroma. Nice work indeed.0The price is a little more expensive than a usual chinese restaurant. But I would still recommend this place for people who is new to Chinese food and doesnt wanna waste time trying ""wrong"" place.', 'Din Tai Fung is a classic that never disappoints. Although the Taipei shops are still a bit better (and cheaper!), the Causeway Bay location is excellent. Even with a huge area, the restaurant is generally packed from morning until night closing, and for good reason.The xiao long bao are the best anywhere (sweetie says Kao Chi in Taipei is slightly better, but I disagree), with thin skins and flavorful soup inside. The fried buns are also good, but not as superlative.Also winning plaudits are the various types of Shanghainese noodles, and the green vegetables, especially pea shoots.', 'Came here to have lunch with 1 of my colleague. It\'s been a long time since I had Din Tai Feng because I always felt other than their xiao long bao the rest of the food/dishes and very normal not outstanding. Their Lamien is not worth ordering.Anyhow we were there at around 12.30pm, waited about 10mins to get seated. Then after we took order and here it goes;Braised beef stomachTaste is pretty bland, dose not taste the ""braised"" at all. Texture is springy though. If u are used to Hong Kong style mix beef noodle then DTF version is pale in comparison.Xiao long bao originalDo not know why it is sour. The broth and filling was sour!!! Skin were thick also. This are definitely not DTF standard!Crab roe xiao long baoThe dumplings were too fishy for me. I feel it\'s not the season and are using frozen roe which were fishy.Chicken soupThe soup for the price I feel should do better. It\'s has a pretty strong ginger taste which I felt killed the soup.Fried rice w pork chopPork chop is tasty and aromatic but like I say it\'s decent but not spectacular. Same goes for the fried rice. Hongkong cafe\'a version taste better in my opinion. Fried rice w taste of ""wok hei"" which you will not taste it on DTF.Overall the food is light and decent. And service is so so. I am very disappointed with the Xiao long bao today. Just do not understand why the hype and popularity about Din Tai feng when the food is only decent???', ""went for weekday lunch at around 1215pm.Already a queue was forming, but my party had only 3 persons, so I could get a seat pretty quickly. Ordered the following dishes:1) Xiaolong bao (the classic little dragon dumplings)  - 5 out of 5 stars. I like the soup that oozes out of the filling. This won't disappoint.2) Crabmeat xiaolong bao - 3.5 out of 5 stars. More expensive than the classic version, but I didn't really like the crabmeat taste in this. A bit too fishy for my liking.3) vegetables and meat dumpling - 3.5 out of 5 stars. so-so.4) Spinach with garlic - 4.5 out of 5 stars. Nice garlic taste in the dish. Vegetables were nicely cooked.5) Stewed beef with noodles (Hong Siew Ngow Yok Mien)  - 3.5 out of 5 stars. Ok.

The skin was essentially the same as the ones used for the Xiao Lung Baos, but we noticed they were slightly thicker, therefore less delicate. I think they would have been better if they were just as thin. The taste was strongly of Chinese mushrooms, which went well with the vinegar.  Sliced pork and preserved veg with ramen in soupI was quite disappointed with this. The soup was very pedestrian and so was the toppings of sliced pork and preserved vegetables. The noodles were good albeit being in a very boring broth - very fresh but after having tried Sha Tin 18's hand-pulled noodles I don't think this can compare . Steamed pork bun This bun is really good - the patty inside was so juicy and flavourful, without being too fatty. The bun was fresh and steamed to order so it was soft - I would suggest this be consumed 5-10 mins after it arrives on your table as you want it hot but you wouldn't want to burn your tongue, right?

Great for such a cold day.(&)0(&)(&)First of all, there was no introduction of the food. I gave the names myself. This dish was very so-so. The small cold abalone had nothing special. It was a fresh abalone seasoned by sesame oil, with a small slice of cucumber underneath. The cold shrimp was just like one of those served at buffet restaurant, with the shell removed. However, the  indeed made the cold shrimp taste much better by its pickled salty flavour. Such a good idea to put them together.Wok-fried Prawns, Celery, Olive Seed0Wok-fried Prawns, Celery, Olive SeedWok-fried Prawns, Celery, Olive SeedThere seemed to be some problems with the order of serving of the dishes. This dish wasn\'t hot enough when served. The plate was cold. The prawns were just so-so with nothing special. I had definitely expected more!A side note was that it was quite interesting to find that a paper butterfly was put on some mashed potato to decorate the plate but unfortunately the position of the butterfly was not always so proper. Maybe the chef was too busy? The mashed potato was totally tasteless.0The lobster was not fresh enough. I found the lobster meat a bit ....This dish was also served too soon after serving of the prawns, so we didn\'t have time to enjoy the food at its topmost quality. By the way, please note the paper butterfly...Stewed Wagyu Short Rib, Trio of Onion0Stewed Wagyu Short Rib, Trio of OnionStewed Wagyu Short Rib, Trio of OnionThis Wagyu was really good. The Wagyu was stewed very well so that it was really tender. The sauce was quite tasty and not oily at all. It was quite a good dish, except that my piece of short rib was too fatty! The trio of onions reminded me of Shanghainese-style of fried beef with onions.Steamed Garoupa Fillet, Sichuan Chili0Steamed Garoupa Fillet, Sichuan ChiliAgain this dish was served together with the beef so we had to eat this dish first before the fish turned cold. This dish was very good. They were served really hot. The garoupa fillets were really fresh. I liked how there were Sichuan Chili to enhance the flavour. The transparent noodles underneath were quite delicious eating with the Sichuan Chili too.While they had served all the mains together at a time, it took us a long long while to be served the udon, maybe because they had been waiting for another table next door to finish their mains to cook ours altogether. They didn\'t let us order 1 fried rice and 1 udon to share, which I actually didn\'t see much inconvenience for them to do so because they were offering two choices only anyway.Soup Inaniwa Udon, Bean Curd Sheet, Fish Broth0Soup Inaniwa Udon, Bean Curd Sheet, Fish BrothSoup Inaniwa Udon, Bean Curd Sheet, Fish BrothAnyway, the fish broth was really rich in fish with quite some pepper. The bean curd sheets were fresh and plentiful. The udon was smooth. I preferred this one to fried rice because this one was obviously more healthy and less oily.0It was dessert of the day and we didn\'t have a choice. I was never a fan of but it was ok. The sweet soup was rich in ginger and was of the right degree of sweetness. The sweet potato was ok, although the one for my lunch partner didn\'t seem so. Great for such a cold day. It made me so warm after drinking.Overall, most of the food was good despite some failed dishes. But given the price of the food at a per-head cost of $800 for such a meal, it was definitely too expensive. It was very obvious that they would like to offer good service with servers in general being polite and attentive helping you to refill your water/tea from time to time. There were a lot of room for improvement in the order of serving and decoration of the plates, especially if they are targeting at achieving Michelin stars or charging Michelin prices for their food.

The small but juicy and delicious mantis shrimp (with the colorful nickname of ) are laid on top of a pile of flavored breadcrumbs, with shredded celery on the side drenched with olive oil. And yes those are watermelon blocks on the plate. Overall the dish was reasonably light and tasty. Not a bad start. My main course was cernia con carciofi e salsa al vino bianco. The garoupa was fried and reasonably tasty, but it was a tad dry for my taste. It's easy to get good steamed garoupa at any Chinese restaurant, or even at cha chan teng (), so I was little disappointed today. The gob of foam on top is flavored with artichokes, and there are also artichokes on the side.I was actually reasonably full at this point, but went for the ananas, lime, granitas menta. The chunks of pineapple are topped with a big scoop of crushed ice, flavored with lime and Crme de Menthe - hence the hint of alcohol. Pretty refreshing and light.In spite of the execution for the garoupa, I still thought lunch was pretty decent.

I started to fear I might get sick later but fortunately I didn't. There was a huge pile of tempura flakes. Plus, notice the green glob in the middle? That is wasabi mixed with relish. Why did they do that? Why can't they just give me normal wasabi? It was odd. It was weird. I plucked it aside.0The strangest thing is that the minute I finished an item from my tray, the staff took it away. It was like a cha chan teng where they constantly hovered over you.

This is a restaurant managed by one of those celebrity chefs; however, it was just overly praised and priced; and the food was nothing to write home or suggest to others.We had the following:1.Shrimp dumpling  Tasteless and overly priced.  2.Vegetarian dumpling  Okay but if you ordered the steamed crystal dumplings with mixed mushrooms and black truffle, then you could save yourself from ordering this item, as the fillings were the same for both.  The dumpling skin was extremely sticky and stuck with the container.  It was not easy to separate the dumpling without breaking the skin.  3.Steamed dumplings with dried conpoys and vegetables  This was probably the best dim sum we had this afternoon.4.Rice rolls with scallops  Tasteless.5.Steamed crystal dumplings with mixed mushrooms and black truffle  Uneventful.  Filling was same as vegetarian dumpling as mentioned above.  The only difference was the way they were wrapped and it came  with 4 pieces.  Vegetarian dumplings came with 3 pieces only.6.Spring Roll  The skin was very crunchy, but tasteless filling.  7.Crab meat porridge  This was probably the best item we had at the whole lunch.  The only problem was too pricey and portion served was very small.8.Deep-fried diced mango and shrimps roll  The shape was quite cute, but couldnt figure out whether this was a dessert or a dim sum.  The filling was like a mango paste but couldnt taste any shrimp at all.  9.Layered yam and taro pudding  This item really prompted me to write this review.  It came in a glass bottle, similar to a big size baby formula bottle with a cap, and served with a spoon.  The pudding has two different shades of purple color.  Due to the container, we couldnt really share the pudding with unless spoon fed or spooned out the pudding and put in the bowls.  The whole pudding also had no taste.  It was not sweet, and with no yam or taro taste.  Also, I didnt know when this was made and how long it had been sitting in the fridge.

Cha siu was really yummy last time. The pork was juicy and the glaze wasn\'t overpowering. Tenderness. Their cheapest fried rice, I forget the specific name, is amazingly good. Remember to ask for ""little oil"" though.Spicy beancurd on hot plate is delicious. Must try.Clay stone pot with mixed vegetables and vermicelli in broth is also tasty. The dried shrimp add flavor without overpowering, and my personal favorite are the mushrooms. they are to DIE for! There is a slightly buttery taste to them - I bet they are stir fried first and then added to the broth or something. The flavor is sheer delight.Another one of my faves is the ma lai go - Chinese steamed spongecake. I would totally walk here just for this!A con is the uhh steamed chicken pieces with a slightly spicy sauce.  The sauce itself is delicious, but the chicken... not so fresh.Unsure about the price, boss always pays.Hope this helps!'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/wan-chai-dragon-king-restaurant/18467?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

Not as busy as weekday for lunch, staff are friendly n helpful, we required to change our table due to next table guests has some hygiene issue! Foods served in a timelyManner, and tasted good, for sure we will be back again', 'I needed to do a couple of things in Central this afternoon and with my little nugget around, fine dining won\'t be an option but luckily, there are tons of dining options around here including Dragon Noodle Academy (), a place that I\'ve been waiting to check out personally.At first, I thought they are a noodle place (judging from its name) but they turned out to be much more. Imagine a lobster themed dim sum and noodle joint with a dark dungeon vibe and a bit of kungfu twist. That pretty much sums it up.0We were pleasantly surprised that they\'re still open for lunch after half past two. It was right after we got seated that we were told the restaurant actually opens from 11:30AM to 11PM without stoppage but the food menu does change ever so slightly after lunch hours with less dim sum to offer.0I\'m all for the throwback theme. The city definitely needs more of these kind of restaurants.0I got some stuff to play with before our food arrives.....0Dragon Noodle Academy probably gets its name from two of their signature items - Dragon (presumably lobster, which is pronounced ""dragon prawn"" in Chinese) and noodle but they\'re far from a one-trick pony. I heard they have a pretty good peking duck too (marinating in the oven now). 0First, some homemade camomile tea to quench my thirst. Thought it tasted a little weird but then I\'m never a big fan of tea to begin with.0Seasonal vegetables in soup () ($79) - Something healthy before the funky stuff arrives. The bok choy was served in a light broth with some crisp lily bulb on top. Not bad (Grade: 3/5).Seasonal vegetables in soup ()$ 790Seasonal vegetables in soup ()$ 79Steamed crab and shrimp dumplings () ($59) - Our run of funky dim sum started here with the ""half shrimp half crab"" dumplings. This was pretty tasty with lots of diced shrimp and crab meat in there and the wrapper was fairly thin making the experience even more enjoyable (Grade: 3.5/5).Steamed crab and shrimp dumplings ()$ 590Steamed crab and shrimp dumplings ()$ 59Crispy lobster puff () ($69x2) - For a moment, we all thought we ordered live lobster but no, it\'s their crispy lobster puff. This tasted almost exactly like a puff pastry with shredded radish () but with lobster meat as filling. I thought the crust was really flaky with the sweetness of the lobster meat backing it up nicely. It didn\'t have the usual multiple layers of a puff pastry with shredded radish but no complaints from me there (Grade: 4/5).Crispy lobster puff ()$ 690Crispy lobster puff ()$ 69Steamed shrimp rice rolls () ($69) - Okay, the shrimp rice roll doesn\'t qualify as a funky dim sum. It was decent but probably one that I could do without (Grade: 3/5).Steamed shrimp rice rolls ()$ 690Steamed shrimp rice rolls ()$ 6963C poached egg on turnip cake () ($59) - I was curious to see how the turnip cake worked with the 63C poached egg but sadly, the result was a bit appalling.

On the bright side, I thought the filling of diced mushrooms, green pea and sweet corn in a light black truffle sauce was pretty delicious (Grade: 3/5).1Lobster and shrimp roe ""lo mein"" () ($149) - We\'re saving the best for last here with the lobster and shrimp roe lo mein making the curtain call.0I have the feeling that the lobster bisque would be a good match for the Chinese noodle and I was right on the money (Grade: 3.5/5)!Lobster and shrimp roe ""lo mein"" ()$ 1490Lobster and shrimp roe ""lo mein"" ()$ 149I can see they\'ve put a lot of thoughts into the design of this place paying homage to the traditions of Hong Kong.

The place is large with casual/nice environment.  They have two 2-people lunch set options at $489 / $689 which are not cheap.  My friend and I finally ordered the lobster tail / claw soup noodles.  My noodles were served only one minute after we made the order and it was warm not hot.  Claw is deep fried, the kind that you'd find at a Chinese wedding banquet, larger in size though.  Taste is ok but not superb. Tea is $19 per head plus 10% service charge.

So all orders that were before them now waited even longer.Ordered 2 - 5 star salads. The salads after delivery were light on dressing and poorly assembled. Could not find any bacon until I got to the bottom of the bowl. Had to search out the steak as well. The goats cheese was like a clump or a single ball wadded up in the greens. Have to say it was pretty poor. We had plenty of time to watch the staff preparing the food and were amazed at how disorganized this counter is from plates coming from the back room to precut condiments for salads. They were not prepared for business this only made the wait longer. Staffs are oblivious to the guests wait times and lack clear direction, they chit chat among themselves and the drivers from the courier service with no sense of urgency to tend to business.

After my lunch, I remember why I don't eat there anymore.  The seating is very limited in the restaurant so I had to take away my lunch.  There were a lot of people, so I waited around 10 mins for my order.  I got the lunch special ~ salad, soup & drink for $48.  I had the cobb salad, chili and lemonade:0The salad was over dressed, the greens were practically swimming in the dressing and there was just too much cheese. The avocados were hard which means they weren't ripe but the best thing of the salad was that everything was chopped up into bite size and didn't have the whole leaf of lettuce or big chunks of chicken.I ordered the chili, but as you can see from the pic above, that is NOT chili, it's a tomato based soup with beans.  Very, very oily and it wasn't even hot.  I know you must think because I took the food back to the office it must be lukewarm, but no, it was very tepid, almost cold.  My office is a 3 minute walk from Dressed.The best part of the whole meal was the lemonade, not too sweet and very tangy.  Great drink.All in all, I think they do better salads at Taste across the street.  Bigger portions of the salad at least!!!!"", ""Had the panini and salad set for $48I opted for the chicken-lime chili panini, wiht mozzarella cheese. I couldn't taste the lime or the chili, but the panini and the cheese were great. Only problem was it was way too small; like it said it was half a panini, but it was half a small panini, so it was tiny. Smaller than the panini pictured in the window.The soup was white tuscon bean and sausages. It looked good, but had a generic 'vegetable soup' taste, with lumps of sausages.Overall, it's not bad, but I wouldn't eat here again, and I was still hungry after eating - bad sign!""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/wan-chai-dressed/30938?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

I never really got a chance to visit the restaurant, not that I am not interested in it, I am, but somehow their Ad stand looked a bit too crappy. Not until Ryu_Ng brought this up, who gave me a perfect reason to dine in the restaurant.Classy Looking0Classy LookingDumpling Pro was unexpectedly decent to what I have imagined. The decor was pretty nice and Chinese classy with wooden tables and chair. The colour mode was mainly in strong red and dark brown which create a sense of Chinese culture. I particularly like the wooden menu that hang on the walls, they were wooden plates with beautifully crafted Chinese words. Just the banner over the roof at the cashier was crappy which I dislike.The restaurant was crazy at lunch hours, particularly at a small restaurant like this. There were also quite a range of dishes to choose from, which I didn't expect in here. I ordered the dumplings set with noodles which Ryu recommended.1) Undistributed filling and thick skin, but nice noodles...0Undistributed filling and thick skin, but nice noodles...There were in total four dumplings in my bowl of noodles, the amount was alright but would be better if there could be five. The dumplings was in size of medium. The dumplingskin was rather thick and the filling was inconsistent. There should be pork, leeks and shrimp but only one of my three dumplings had shrimp in it. Since the pork and the leek taste was very light, the exisitence of shrimp literally brought up the taste of the dumpling.Just as I wonder how could their dumpling be so colourless, I found the leek dumplings that I exchanged with Ryu pretty nice! The leek taste stood out clearly, fresh and strong. I guess the leek taste was brought down by the meat.Enough of the dumpling talk, let switch to talk about the noodles. The noodles was much nicer than the dumplings. The restaurant offered thin and thick noodles which I chose the thin one. The noodles was cooked al dente and surprisingly had a strong flour taste which was very very nice.2) Hog Earokay dish...but I dislike it.0okay dish...but I dislike it.There was cold dishes in the set lunch, I ordered the hog ear.

Both where very good - good quality meat, high share if vegetables in the stuffing, good size. The boiled ones to the point, the fried ones crispy, but not to oily.Also tried the sour and spicy soup - quite sweet, but otherwise good taste.

183,EAT.it Italy Eatery,Causeway Bay,Italian,4.0,168.7,0.0,"Living so close to Causeway Bay, I tend to eat at more casual places when I'm by myself. Just a quick bite is usually all I need. And Eat. it became a regular haunt for me. With it's casual yet inexpensive Italian, I could just eat quietly all by myself.After a very lengthy renovation, Eat.it is back and I went back to visit my favorite place. The place now has a more red colored theme. It still has both indoor and outdoor seating.1The food stations are still there. But gone is the big long communal table. All are smaller tables for smaller groups.0They had sandwich lunch sets but I was in the mood for spaghetti.0With the renovation, they have also changed the way you order. Gone is the card system where you get a card and make all your orders at the food stations and pay on your way out. Now, you get a menu and order and pay at the cashier. This was a bit disappointing as I did like looking at the food stations before deciding on my order. Now, I only stare at a menu as the food stations were devoid of people until they get an order. Menu is in English and Chinese. There is no 10% service charge. You make your order and they will give you a numbered place card where they will bring the food to you when ready.02I ordered a Forest Fruit mocktail ($60). Made of raspberry, orange juice, lime and elderflower. This was pretty good. And pretty sweet. To make it even more sweet, they topped it with powdered sugar. I think that was a bit excessive. There was also a slice of watermelon and dragonfruit as well.0I made my own pasta as it was one of the things I loved about this place. I did a pomodoro sauce with chitarra spaghetti. ($128). Portion size was decent but not very big. I loved that it was topped with a generous scrapping of Parmesan. The sauce was rich and tangy. The spaghetti was cooked al dente. At least with all the changes, the food hasn't changed much.0Glad this place is back as it will continue to be a regular haunt. I don't know why they got rid of the card system as part of the reason I liked it was so I could walk around and see the food before I decide. Now that you order from a menu, it takes that away. Service was a bit off. When I first walked in, the people at the cashier basically ignored me until I finally asked where is the card. It was then they gave me a menu and explained to me to order by menu now. Were they expecting everyone to know this? Other than that, I will be back if I want casual Italian."", ""First off, let my start by saying that I've tried both Giando and Gia before coming to Eat.It so I was already expecting great quality food. I was NOT disappointed.The atmosphere is great. It's right next to Victoria Park and whether you sit in the airconditioned interior or the outer solarium-like area (for those of you who smoke) the atmosphere is chill and trendy. Both areas are spacious so you never feel like you're squashed between other customers. I actually love the cafeteria style. It's a great place to bring friends, family, or a casual date.When you enter, you're given a card that gets scanned whenever you order from a station. First there's the drinks station which offers a great selection of both soft and alcoholic drinks (beers and cocktails for $68!). Then there's desserts, which I have yet to try as I'm always too full from eating everything else but they look delicious and if they're half as good as the ones in Giando and Gia then I'm sure they're fantastic. After that, there's the sandwich station. We've tried the Chicken Milanese which is a breaded chicken fillet with salad and tomatoes on ciabatta for only $48! Insanely cheap for a solid sandwich with quality ingredients. Then there's the salad station where you can order from a selection of large salads that are a meal on their own. Or you have the option to choose from either 3 or 5 of the items on the salad bar. I have always chosen 3 and have enjoyed each choice. They are made fresh daily from vegetables that are in season so you don't always find the same choices. I particularly loved the fennel with orange zest as well as the roasted eggplant.Then come the two mains: pizza and pasta. There's a great selection of pizza (I've always seen at least 8 different ones) so that there's something for everyone. I really mean everyone. As in, vegetarians, meat lovers, seafood fanatics, and plain Janes will all find something they love. The crust on the pizza is crisp and it's not too thin or too thick. They're square pizzas without any crust round it, so each bite is a proper mouthful of their delicious toppings.Then there's the pasta. It's freshly made by hand every day, which also means your order comes pretty quick as it only takes a couple minutes to heat up fresh pasta. You can choose from a variety of different forms, e.g. penne, linguine, papardelle, etc. Then you get to choose from a variety of different sauces. All the sauces I've tried were quite decadent and definitely great value for money as they certainly don't skimp on the high quality ingredients which are mostly imported from Italy. When we ordered a la carte in the afternoon I have to admit that I was slightly overwhelmed by my portion. I can really eat a lot but I couldn't finish because of the hearty meaty salsiccia sauce I chose (that and because I had also ordered 3 salad bar items including potatoes).For those of you interested in the set lunch, it's probably the best value for money Italian lunch in Hong Kong. You get a drink, 3 salad bar items, a choice of pasta or 2 slices of pizza (trust me, it's enough), and a scoop of gelato, all for a mere $118. No extra service charge. I brought a bunch of colleagues to try the set lunch and we were all satisfied and really full afterwards, even the guys. A pair of girls even had to share a set lunch as they knew they wouldn't be able to eat it all (amateurs!!).The staff are also helpful and friendly and will explain if you ask for anything. They deliver your main dish to your table (as you get a number when ordering) but you collect your drinks and salad items at their respective stations.Overall, I've been extremely satisfied with both the food and service both times I've been to Eat.It. Both are consistently great and the fact that it was cheap and cheerful was just an extra bonus. You'd easily pay double or more for the same meal in elsewhere but perhaps not even receive the same quality.I'd definitely recommend trying Eat.It and bring a group if you can so you can try as many things as possible. The most difficult part about eating there is trying to decide which dishes to choose from as they're all so good!"", ""After almost half a year since this opened, I return again this time with boyfriend. Eat.it has changed quite a bit since last I visited.Eat.it is an interesting concept. When you enter, you are given a card to make all your purchases. After you finish eating, you show this card to the cashier where they tally up the total and then you pay and go. There is no 10% service charge. I like to describe it a Ramen Champion Italian style.They changed a few things since last I came. They no longer give you a pager to pick up your meal after ordering. Instead they now give you a numbered place card to place on your table and they bring the food to you. They now have a few new main course type items that went beyond pasta and pizza. This time I decided to try one of them.Chicken Milanese ($138). First off ... big portion size. The chicken had a cripsy coating that wasn't oily. The meat was moist and succulent. And the best part? the salad was dressed properly. I hate how the majority of restaurants here serve salad and it's basically one of two versions : (1). salad greens and a drizzle of dressing so not all of it coated and you are left feeling like a horse eating grass or (2). salad greens and so much dressing, it's soaked like a soup and becomes one soggy mess. This salad was tossed properly with dressing so every green vegetable was coated and not dripping like a wet rag.0Blood Orange Soda ($20). I love blood orange Italian soda. I always drink the one from San Pellegrino. So, I had never tried this brand. I bit sharper than San Pellegrino but tasted refreshing.0Apricot Crumble ($50). Portion size again was fairly huge. It's definitely sharable. But it was really REALLY sweet. Even boyfriend thought so and he loves everything so sweet, it's bordering on diabetic. But it was packed with apricots. The best was the little bit of custard on top. It was creamy and delicious. I would have loved this dessert more if it wasn't so sweet.0Always a great place for a casual meal.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-eat-it-italy-eatery/432110?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
184,EIGHT GRAND Bar & Restaurant,Causeway Bay,American,2.9,127.1,1.0,"Eight Grand is a nice looking restaurant in Hysan Place, but it was not satisfying to say the least. Firstly, the interior decoration at first seems quite American-style pub, but when you sit down, you realise that it's really not comfortable when the chair is so small and hard and most of them don't have a back rest. Although I must say the service there is pretty good as they offered to change my seat to one with a back rest as there weren't many people there that day.00We went there for lunch and they have a limited choice for lunch set.0We ordered the soup and it felt kind of like they threw all the leftovers into the soup. It was definitely quite strange and the tomato flavour was slightly artificial. 0The main dish we ordered was the stuffed chicken breast which by itself was pretty good. Though the chicken was a bit dry, the filling was good. It was a mixture of spinach, mushroom and ricotta cheese and it was flavourful and went well with the chicken. Unfortunately, the sauce was very bland and did nothing to add flavour to the dish. 0Lastly we decided to order a Wasabi and Alioli fries ($78). This was probably the worst dish of the meal as it tasted nothing of wasabi and the Alioli completely overpowered it. The fries were okay, but could've used with more potatoes. The Alioli was really just strange tasting in a way that is difficult to describe. 0"", ""I've been working in CWB for two years now and we litereally tried almost every restaurant in CWB. We ususally stay away from Malls bc we assume it's always crowded. We decided to go a little earlier and find something in Hysan. We stumble across this little bar and restaurant in the mall. they were serving some interested Tex-Mex type of menu so we decided to give it a try...Sandwich is what I ordered. There's not a lot of places in HK that does sandwich right. ALthough this is not the type of food they specialised, there were some ingredients in the sandwich that went along with their theme. They make some kickin guacamole. Inside the sandwich of the week they had chicken which was very tender and juicy, guacamole spread, tomato bacon and the bread was toasted to perfection. The staff was very friendly and the place was small and cozy. Now we got a new spot for lunch since they are very reasonably priced...."", 'This was one of the few restaurants in Hysan Place that was empty for lunch on a very crowded weekend ... for good reason. From their very limited menu, we ordered a cheeseburger, salmon salad, spaghetti with chicken and an overpriced beer.The HK$128 burger was average, but only about half the size of the bun -- doubtful if the beef patty was even 1/4 pound -- and the HK$119.

What can go wrong with an old fashion Char Siu Bao? How about the lack of Char Siu in the buns?0That wasn\'t even the worse. We also ordered the Stir Fried Rice Noodles with Beef. It was oily, the portion was tiny, and the beef had no texture.0I thought that if desserts came around, the egg tarts may actually be better. I held a ray of hope for these egg tarts, but alas I was disappointed once more. The tart base was crumbly, and had no buttery smell or taste to it. The bottom of the base was soggy with oil. The egg custard inside had this strange smell that I could not comprehend.0Unfortunately, the entire experience was horrendous. I don\'t think I\'ve ever been so disappointed in a Chinese restaurant before. Not only was the price bad, the service was slow and the waiters all gathered in a little circle for a chit chat, making it barely possible to ask for anything.I felt that I was definitely paying for ""the view"", but it certainly isn\'t worth it to me.

Its probably one of not many places in Hong Kong where you can get shrimp ramen base. The shrimp broth base has a very rich flavour. Personally I prefer spicy and full of flavour food so this restaurant got my attention! In general all the ingredient options are very simple. You can add extra egg, slice of Bbq pork, spring onions and ginger tempura. The restaurant opened no more than 1 Year, decorations are very simple, table are for sharing. Unfortunately stuff not always speak English so sometimes I had a trouble with the order. But you still can read menu and get a simple pick up) Totally good place for filling up the belly and enjoying shrimp broth base ramen.', ""A tasty bowl of ramen. I went for the rich flavour which is a mix of pork bone broth and their original shrimp broth. I also went for extra noodles (HKD15 for 50 g) and extra 3 pieces of charsiu (HKD30) on top of the basic HKD88, as this option only comes with one small slice of charsiu. There is also 10% surcharge so all in all it came to HKD140 plus dollars - rather expensive for a bowl of ramen when there are plenty of other options in the area that would be fuller for a lot less.I ordered the thick noodles. It was al dente - firm and chewy. Note there was no option to choose how cooked your noodles are. And also note if you order the extra noodles they serve it in the bowl - you have to request it to be served separately if that is your preference. However, even with the extra 50 gram portion of noodles its best not to be served in a separate bowl as the original portion size isn't that big.Soup was rich. It had a good balance of pork broth and shrimp broth. Egg was mediocre - overcooked. You can tell as the yolk was half solid.. Extra precision needed and maybe longer marinade time as the egg did taste rather bland. Charsiu was decent enough but rather on the small side. Sliced quite thin so i am glad i ordered extra portion of charsiu but i don't think it is worth HKD30... The Charsiu could do with a bit more flavour. I would say its clean tasting.Nice touch is the logo on their napkins. They use wooden chopsticks. Also there is water taps and usb chargers at seated area.Overall i gave it 4 stars for taste because the broth was good but I only rated it okay because i think for the price and amount you get it's a bit on the pricier side."", 'Wrong choice for a Sunday Lunch... service:*McDonalds offer better service *waiters - no knowledge, no training, and basically a bunch of zombies trying to regurgitate Food:*over rated *disgrace to Japanese foodTakeaway options:*does not offer this service, instead was suggested by the zombie crew to throw it away.

It turn out to be intensely flavoured and full of umami taste. According to the chef, each bowl is made roughly from 50 shrimp heads so the flavourjust burst in your mouth.The noodle comes with choice ofthick or thinsize and it ismade perfectly al dente. I must say the cha siu is probably one of the best in town and it istender and juicy. The onsen egg already comes with the noodle which is very generous.

As soon as we sit down waiters were already asking us to order, and brought us 4 different menus, pressing us to be fast, and subsequently pushing us to order more water.We went there to eat Italian, but it was actually Cantonese- Italian fusion cuisine, and this would have been also acceptable, if the restaurant was actually advertised like that. But, even from the sign in the entrance, you can see that the restaurant was conceived as a ""Rustic Italian"" restaurant and this is clearly not the case. Every dish, even the most simple like bruschetta, was messed up and nothing actually followed italian recipes or traditions. The staff is all local and they actually cook local food! It\'s wrong to talk about Italian restaurant and Italian cuisine if it\'s basically managed by locals.Risotto is completely wrong because rice is cooked in the wrong way, too much water and oil, I believe taleggio was actually poor quality gorgonzola, and we could not see black truffle in the plate. And even the plate the risotto was served in is wrong, since it is supposed to be a flat dish.The pizza was a piece of bread reheated from the night before, too small, no high quality tomato, but again stracciatella bought in bulk.In the recipe it is said that the suckling pig is made in the Roman Style, slow cooked, but i guess it was heated in the microwave.

190,Emma's Noodle,Causeway Bay,Chinese,3.5,86.0,0.0,"I have a strange tradition after I wake up from doing a night shift. I must find a hot bowl of noodles that are washed down with a cold glass of ice lemon tea. I usually have a favorite in Causeway Bay that I go to many times but on the odd days I try out new noodle shops that open in the area.One such place is . I don't know why the English name is Emma's Noodles as that is not the direct translation from the Chinese which is twelve flavor.Anyways...the shop is not very big and there are not a lot of seats. They were oddly playing hip hop when I was there. They had a several cow heads on the walls as decor.0The menu is found at the cashier. You order and pay here (there is no 10% service charge) before sitting down to wait for you meal. Menu is in English and Chinese. What this place serves is beef based noodles. From the soup to the add on ingredients, it's all beef. So, if you don't like to eat beef, I guess this place is not for you. You basically order your type of broth (spicy, braised beef broth or light beef broth) for $56 and then add on things that you may want as the basic bowl of noodles includes only marinated vegetable and sliced beef.0While I was waiting for my noodles to be prepared, I noticed this place had free wifi. I also ended up reading that this place prided itself with the twelve different spices used to create their soup base. Items such as cumin, cinnamon bark, Sichuan peppercorns, fennel, star anise, cardamon, Tien Tien chili peppers ... just to name a few because I couldn't recognize the other ones from the poster on the wall.0The bowl of noodles I ordered: braised beef broth and sliced beef ($56) with tripe ($18), spiced corn egg ($6) and dried bean curd ($6). The total price of my bowl of noodles? A whopping $86! No wonder they had the option of ordering all the ingredients for $98. At least portion size was big and hearty. There was a lot of beef and I kept digging and digging away and still found more pieces of beef. The beef was tender with a slight spicy kick to it. The tofu was like a sponge and soaked up the soup like one. And the soup itself? It was interesting. Rich and complex, it literally takes your tastebuds for a ride, ending with a lingering slight numbing sensation from the chilli peppers. Yet it wasn't spicy. Just a slight numbing sensation.0The noodles used were vermicelli. I like this kind of noodle and I was glad it was still chewy and not over cooked.0Here's a look at the dried tofu (or ice honeycomb tofu) for those that don't know what it looks like. I love this type of tofu whenever I'm ordering hotpot as it's a great way to soak up all the soup for it's sponge-like texture.0A pretty good bowl of noodles with a rich complex broth. Though a bit expensive, at least the size was big enough for me to be fairly full. May return again with boyfriend as I think he would like this as well. Perhaps next time I will try the clear broth as I overheard the person next to me say the clear broth tasted better.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-emmas-noodle/480745?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
191,Empress Cafe,Wan Chai,Italian,4.2,90.0,0.0,"Came here for a Friday lunch. Tucked in a quiet alley, the cafe entrance was not easy to find, but it makes it an ideal lunch time getaway from the hustle and bustle in just a few footsteps off Johnston Road.It was lunch time rush hour when we arrived and the cafe was already fully packed. After ordering our meals at the cashier, we found ourselves seats at the bar table facing the open kitchen, which was a good experience in itself.0They offer several daily pasta priced at $65. With an addition of $25, you get a mixed green salad and a drink on top of your main. The salad was supposed to come with a slice of garlic bread. After we placed our order, however, the staff told us that the garlic bread was sold out and therefore they would give us a bigger portion of salad. I ordered a creamy chicken spaghetti and a purple sweet taro latte. It didn't take long for the food to be served. However, the cashier took the wrong order and rose latte was served instead. But I was ok with it since I am a fan of rose-flavoured stuff. 0The pasta was al dente. The sauce was creamy and seasoning was spot on. There was also a generous portion of chicken in the pasta. The overall portion served was just right and the dish tasted authentic and nothing pretentious. As for the latte, it was smooth and the sweetness was just right. But I was disappointed with the very artifical rose flavour of the latte which was overpowering.

The day I visited was off peak hours and only 2 tables of diners remained. I saw room for improvement for their services such as serving the right set of dining ware (I was having spaghetti but only a fork), and both the salad and spaghetti were tabled simultaneously. Anyway, these teething problems could be solved quickly.Generally it is a good news for both office guys and residents in the area to have one more choice of local caf with reasonably price. Will definitely come back for their waffles.a) Green Salad and Toast (set with coffee for extra $25)  8/10Green Salad & Toast0Green Salad & ToastThe salad was fresh and well mixed with balsamic and olive oil. The portion was appropriate. However, the toast was a bit dry at the back.b) Spaghetti with Clams, Spicy Garlic and Olive Oil ($65)  8/100They serve a few choices of hot pasta daily. I would suggest avoiding the use of mixed Italian and English on the menu to improve readibility.Spaghetti with Spicy Garlic and Olive Oil0Spaghetti with Spicy Garlic and Olive OilAs I arrived late for lunch, they ran out of prawns so clams were substituted. The dish was generally delicious despite more than enough salt was used. Moreover, the extra loads of minced garlic and garlic flakes overwhelmed the flavour of the entire dish.

While I appreciate the effort not to make the noodle too soggy,  this is not environmental friendly.The rib, which was in fact a thick piece of porkchop, was tender and juicy, and delicious as well.The noodle is fine but nothing remarkable.

196,Fan Tang,Causeway Bay,Chinese,3.6,350.0,,"Came here for dimsum with a group of 8 and a reservation.  Suggest reserve table beforehand since the seating is very limited. Food:  The good thing about this place is that you can order the dimsum pieces by the number.  Ordered a number of classics and some new ones with twists.  The ones that stood out:  Har Gow - insanely huge and stuffed with shrimp;  Soup dumplings - very tasty soup and meat, comparable to Din Tai Fung;  Roast pork pastry - comes as a rectangular pastry, multi layered and flaky while the filling was tasty juicy roast pork.  Another that is worth mentioning:  Egg yolk layered cake - this is their twist on the classic drippy egg yolk buns, but its in a multilayer triangle piece, different layers of yellow and soft white.  It was just okay, I didn't like it that much because it had this weird texture that seemed grainy/sandy like the ingredients were mixed well, and then I realised there were pieces of coconut in it.  Service:  Service here is pretty attentive, but the waiters' attitude can come off stuck up in a sense.  There's also a woman who seems like the owner who walks around asking if you enjoy the food.Decor:  Decor is very nice here - very good use of nice colors like dark olive green; gold; white.  There's high ceilings; comfy comfy chairs, some have booths with nice sofas; gold framed paintings.  The atmosphere created is Very intimate and personal - none of that noisy local HK dimsum feel.  The restaurant tries to preserve that very high end private/exclusive feel.  Even the entrance is pretty private considering you don't even notice its a restaurant on the street level.Sizing it up:  I enjoyed the intimate atmosphere the most here.  The food was up to par to the level you expect when you pay more.  We ended up paying $350 a person for dimsum - which is actually very expensive, considering there wasn't much leftover food.  I recommend it for special occasion dining.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-fan-tang/31053?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

Price remained the same at a cost of $198+10% per head.Double Boiled Ginseng & Conch soup0Double Boiled Ginseng & Conch soupAll of us ordered the Double Boiled Ginseng & Conch soup as our starter. It was a good soup with indeed some ginseng and conch which were both of reasonable quality. Just to pick bones from an egg, some pork in the soup was too hard and rough.Truffle Mushroom Dumpling & Signature Shrimp Dumpling...0Truffle Mushroom Dumpling & Signature Shrimp Dumpling...The dim sum was the same as last time and the quality was equally good, if not better! They were freshly steamed which were so hot when served. The wraps were both very thin with loads of ingredients. The truffle mushroom dumpling smelt so good of truffle with loads of mushrooms. The signature shrimp dumpling was so meaty with fresh shrimp ingredients. Delicious.Tea & Oolong Tea0Tea & Oolong TeaFor some reason it took so long for our mains to arrive. After repeated following up, a server made us 2 complimentary teas to make up. I tried the first tea only, which I forgot the name or ingredients, but it was refreshing indeed and was just slightly sweet. Good!Golden Amber Prawns with salted egg yolk & sugar walnut...0Golden Amber Prawns with salted egg yolk & sugar walnut...Finally our mains arrived. This golden amber prawns with salted egg yolk and sugar walnut was ok taste-wise but the batter for the prawns was a bit too thick! They could have been much better. The sugar walnut (although not much) was yummy!Fang Fang Soy Chicken in Chinese Rose Wine0Fang Fang Soy Chicken in Chinese Rose WineThis Fang Fang soy chicken in Chinese Rose Wine required an additional charge of $50+10% which was really good. It smelt so so good when served! It really lifted your expectation just by its look. And indeed the chicken was very well-seasoned with a slightly sweet and delicious sauce. It was highly recommended.Curry Beef Brisket with potatoes & bell peppers0Curry Beef Brisket with potatoes & bell peppersThe curry beef brisket was good as well with tender beef briskets and delicious curry sauce. Even the potatoes were so delicious with crispy crust and soft interior. There were quite a lot of bell peppers and onions accompanying the beef briskets. To pick bones from an egg, there could have been more beef briskets and the curry sauce could have been thicker.Lotus Leaf Mushroom Rice0Lotus Leaf Mushroom RiceWe all chose this over the Jasmine rice. Last time, I recalled there was insufficient flavour or smell of lotus leaf and the rice was just like plain rice. But this time it seemed better with richer flavour of the lotus leaf. But again I found it a bit too plain still.Sweetened Almond Cream0Sweetened Almond CreamI chose sweetened almond cream as my dessert. It was a bit too diluted but still it was smooth and not overly sweet.Fried Carrot Custard Dumpling0Fried Carrot Custard DumplingI didn't the fried carrot custard dumpling but it looked so cute that I couldn't help but take a picture! My lunch partner said that the fried carrot was actually something with black sesame stuffing and a crispy crust while there was a vanilla ice-cream served on the side. I would definitely have ordered this if I had known that it was made of these ingredients!Overall, I think the quality of the food had improved even more, making it a even better deal given the price and location in Central. Just that service was a bit slow today maybe because they were really too busy. Would definitely come back from time to time and recommend it to my friends."", 'Our Fathers Day Lunch was ruined by this restaurant. What happened?? The restaurant did set lunches for Fathers day, we all ordered from the set menu thinking nothing can go wrong when a restaurant can prepare everything in advanced. We were wrong.....It took 1 hour for starters to come (pre-made salad & dimsum). Took another 1 hour for our mains to be served, whilst for our fathers it took an extra 30mins for their mains to be served (yes, you are right, it took a total of 2.5hours for starters and mains to be served for them). We were frankly frustrated because two of our diners had another event to go to so we asked them if they could serve a little faster...The manager came out and said we were the only table with an issue, and hinted it must be our problem (yes, I was shocked too when I heard that coming out of her mouth). We asked if she could follow up with the food, and guess what.... she said if she did not spend time talking to us she could have followed up with the food already....  just when you thought it couldnt get any worse...It ended up taking another 1 hour for its desserts to be served. Ive been Chinese all my life and have never had a dim sum lunch where it took 3.5hours; had the ability to piss off all the people we were trying to celebrate for, and the diners had to take attitude from the manager. I asked to speak to the general manager, turns out he wasnt at work, I guess thats why management was so poor... there was none. Frankly, I feel bad for the waiters and waitresses, there is no system, they were serving like a headless chicken only. Maybe we were a table of 10, thats why a place with almost no management or system in place completely failed to cope with it. I hope they dont screw up small table orders the way they screw up ours, and I really hope the management team reflects on this. Just by observing how they operated this afternoon even someone like me with no f&b management experience can think of a few ways for them to improve on. These comments can help their business if they do the right things down the road. Anyways, would not recommend this place for now, hope you diners have a better experience than we did if you ever have to visit them.', ""We went to the opening launch Fang Fang's brunch. We were initially quite excited for this brunch, as it claimed to be pan-asian fusion food. At first the brunch was fully booked, but last minute we received a call that there were cancellations and we headed straight over to Fang FangThe first thing we noticed when entering was how noisy it was in the restaurant. The music was loud, leading to customers speaking even louder. Next, the choices at the appetizer buffet were very limited and not what one would expect from a hkd 400 brunch. The mains sharing platters were decent though. As for the dessert, we waited almost an hour for 2 scoops of ice cream, without any explanation offered.

I especially love how they serve tea in the old traditional tea pots, as opposed to the boring white ones you would find at many other restaurants around town. fish ball and fish slices soupThis may sound very simple, but I always order this. The fish balls are freshly made, and they use real fish. I particularly enjoy the soup that this dish comes in.char siu baoI feel that the bun has become smaller.

My assessment made was based on the food and service they provided.1I went there for lunch on a weekday. From the menu I saw curry chicken rice which is rare in typical Italian restaurants. And more, the wait staff asked me to order my drink all in one go, for convenience sake, she remarked. I said coffee and when it arrived, its coffee with milk which was commonly found in Cha Chaan Tang.2The environment was casual and relaxing.

203,Fera,Central,Italian,4.1,100.0,0.0,"Walked past this newly opened cosy looking restaurant after yoga earlier this week and found their lunch menu looking good, so I decided to give it a try today... I arrived at 12:30 and was warmly welcomed by the bar tender who asked if I\'d like a table upstairs. Feeling curious, I gladly took his advice.0This was my first visit (and I had never been to the Bar here, ""Tipping Point"", before). Love the minimalist decor in white and Scandinavian blue.0000The menu\'s the same as the one I saw when I walked past on Tuesday --- a selection of pasta (from the classic Carbonara, the vegetarian optionTomato basil cherry to the meat lover\'s no-brainer Sausage and beef ragu), Risotto ai fungi porcini and pan-fried Salmon & pesto veggies. A two-course lunch with drinks included from HK$88 - 110.0My friend went for the Soup and I had the Salad.Cauliflower Soup0Cauliflower SoupHe liked the Cauliflower Soup packed with ""grains"" of cauliflower, which wasn\'t overly creamy.

Pretty fresh Romaine, not the freshest rocket, but I\'m happy with this considering the price and location.pan-fried Salmon & pesto veggies0pan-fried Salmon & pesto veggiesThe pan-fried Salmonwas cooked and seasoned on point.

There was a bit of an imbalance compared to the salmon and baby potatoes (which were ""shining in oil"") --- the broccoli was boiled and unseasoned. As a health conscious foodie I always cook my veggie pretty plainly, but this tasted a bit too plain even for me. I\'d say they could be easily touched up by a toss of extra-virgin olive oil.Sausage and beef ragu with fettuccine pasta0Sausage and beef ragu with fettuccine pastaMy friend enjoyed his pasta and said he\'d be back!0And of course, an iced-lemon tea for a melting hot day like this.All in all, this was one great lunch deal in the heart of Central/Soho.

204,Fiat Caff,Causeway Bay,Italian,3.2,140.3,0.0,"What brought me here:The Fiat Caffe has always been on my list to try, so when my friend visiting from Canada asked me to pick a place in Causeway Bay to try, I chose this!  0Environment & Hygiene:The restaurant wasn't as big and comfortable as I had imagined it to be. It felt werid dining inside a show room. On the right side of the restaurant is where the car lies, along with some merchandise!  Then, on the left was the main dining area. I think they need bigger tables, since the staff had to keep rearranging our plates whenever a dish came. Hygiene was okay, but I didn't understand why the staff had to remove the little plate of salad that came with the panini off the board because her hands almost or if not already touched the salad.00Taste & Value:My friend wasn't too hungry, but still we ordered three items off their menu, along with a drink each.0Specialty Coffee- Coconut with Lime Espresso with Milk ($45)This was one weird drink. It wasn't bad, but not outstanding either. The taste of coconut with espresso was very interesting, but towards the end, the lime was too much. I would probably stick with a more conventional hot drink next time, but I don't regret trying it.  I thought it was quite pricey for a drink that wasn't filled completely and had more ice than liquid.Coconut Lime Coffee Drink0Coconut Lime Coffee DrinkAppetizer- Grilled Octopus with Arugula ($88)The octopus was cooked just right; not tough or chewy at all.  I liked the charcoal flavours that it had. Also, the arugula and acidity of the lemon made it a really refreshing dish to eat.  Grilled Octopus0Grilled OctopusPanini- Balsamic Mushroom & Cheese ($68)This panini was a bit disappointing.  The sandwich wasn't very warm, and the bread didn't taste like leftovers. Also, I was expecting the balsamic to be stronger. This panini was underseasoned I can say.Mushroom Panini1Mushroom PaniniPasta- Pesto Shrimp Linguini ($138)This pasta was the best dish out of everything that we ordered. It came with 4 reasonably sized shrimps that were cooked just right. The pasta was al dente, and the pesto was just amazing. This dish was so tasty that I could have had it all to myself!Pesto Shrimp Linguini0Pesto Shrimp LinguiniService:The service was okay. Nothing too special worth commenting on.Final Verdict:I really did like the pesto pasta, and would go back for it anytime.Supplementary InformationI got 10% off by showing the Lee Gardens card."", 'I went there for lunch with a friend. We were very much attracted by the special design/decor/setting (esp with an eye catching car inside the restaurant which I never found in any other restaurants in HK) and the nice environment there. Why not have a try? We ordered from the lunch set menu. I especially like the wild mushroom soup which has a very nice & strong wild mushroom taste  YUM! Also I ordered the asparagus & crab meat with ink spaghetti - I pretty like the al dente spaghetti. My friend said the orange duck breast salad is a good choice too.  asparagus0asparagusorange duck breast salad0orange duck breast saladwild mushroom soup0wild mushroom souplunch set menu0lunch set menuThe price is very reasonable, esp in Causeway Bay. And considered the special design/decor/setting, food quality, nice envir, etc., Id say its definitely a value for money choice. Ill go again with friends next time.', ""When I first tried this place earlier in the year I loved it, my gf and I had a different pasta each, and a glass of wine, it was all very very nice, and not too pricey, but then again it is more of a cafe feel than a restaurant, so the price should reflect that.My last 3 visits have put me off going again.Visit 2 a few weeks ago - I had their creamy chicken pasta. Far too much cream, far too rich, and very difficult to eat a lot. Any Italian creamy pasta base must also be quite light to avoid being too filling, so I was very disappointed with this dish and could not finish more than half of it, and I felt very bloated afterwards.Visit 3 shortly after that - I saw a screen near entrance showing they do paninis for take out, so I went there a few days later and asked for a take away lunch. The waitress said we do not offer take out. So I took her to the screen and showed her where it said take out available. This is poor staff training, if their staff do not even know what they are advertising and offering!Rather than just say ok sorry, she asked me to wait one minute, and went over to a manager type person and talked to him. He then came over and invited me to sit down and asked me to read the menu to choose my take away item. This was much more professional.I chose their bbq chicken salad, which on the menu sounded delicious. In reality when I got back to my office and opened it, I was looking at the blandest/plainest looking salad I had ever seen, nothing like the Italian tasty description on the menu. The chicken was in tiny diced cubes like a bad school dinner, and covered in a small amount of what tasted like supermarket bbq sauce. The salad itself was simipy lettuce and tomato as far as I recall, with no dressing or seasoning. For an Italian themed cafe/restaurant, this did not reflect any style of Italian cooking whatsoever, and seemed to be nothing like the attractive menu description.I was hoping after trying this salad that Fiat Caffe would become a regular take away lunch spot for me, due to their salads and paninis being very tasty, but it seemed I was wrong about this, and I immediately vowed never to have a take away salad lunch from them again. The salad was definitely not worth the charge of almost HKD 90 either. If it would have had big chunks of tasty grilled chicken, and Italian style salad, like the menu description, then maybe my opinion would have been different, but the chicken was the plainest and most boring tiny cubes I have ever eaten. An Italian person would have laughed in their faces had they seen this salad, and would no doubt have refused to pay.Visit 4 today - I hadn't tried a panini yet, so I thought I would try today. I arrived there to be the only person in the cafe. I ordered a cheese, mushroom, and tomato panini, and a latte. The latte came quickly around the same time that a woman and her young son came in. A salad arrived for them shortly after, and it took over 15 minutes for my panini to arrive.Considering there were no other people in the caffe, and a few chefs visible in the kitchen, I was surprised that they could not get the panini done it less than 10 minutes.When it arrived I was quite shocked. It was tiny, like a child's portion size. For HKD 68 it should have been a lot bigger. I also could not see any filling, as there was hardly any inside, so it was not visible from the sides of the panini. Not at all attractive to look at. Food is not just about taste, it is also strongly about presentation. You know the feeling when you are looking forward to a meal, and when it arrives it looks and smells fabulous, and you smile and can't wait to taste it. My feeling today was the opposite of this, and one of huge disappointment.The bread also was not cooked properly, it was soft and just warm, but a panini should be crispy on both sides and hot, with melted cheese in the middle, when cooked in a proper panini machine. It was as if they just put the ingredients in to a raw panini. I am sure that they did not use a proper panini machine for this.The overall flavour with the mushrooms and tomato was poor and virtually tasteless, due to there being hardly any filling inside the panini. This plus the salad I had last time were both extremely disappointing.It's such a shame, as the cafe itself is lovely to look at, it has a nice vibe, and some of the pastas/evening meals are very very good. But to be a good cafe/restaurant, it is not enough to just have a few select meals that are good.Everything has to be good, AND value for money, and until Fiat Caffe realises this and ups its' game, I shall not be returning.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-fiat-caffe/86415?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
205,Figaro,Central,Japanese,3.9,220.0,0.0,"Figaro is a small restaurant located in the Gough Street area. It was something the caught my eye for it featured Japanese inspired French cuisine. Quite honestly, I love how the Japanese have created their own versions of Western food and it\'s often really fantastic and inspiring.I arrived at lunch. It was pretty full and I was given the last table. And there I sat. For a long LONG time before someone came over and asked if I was ready to order. I replied that I was provided with no menu. The waiter apologized and then gave me the lunch menu. Before I could look at the menu, another waiter came over and stood next to me, pen poised. I didn\'t expect to be paying over a $100 for lunch to only have cha chan teng service. I told him that I just got the menu and so he so ""Oh, I\'ll come back later. I see you\'re not ready to order."" You\'re right, buddy! I just told you I just got the menu!ANYWAYS .... Lunch menu is in English and Chinese. It includes a main and soup. You can upgrade with appetizers, drinks and dessert with a certain amount of money. There apparently is a minimum charge of $88 per person, so no sharing of one set.0They also have a daily special lunch sets. Of whatever they want to point out. This includes an appetizer, soup, main, drink and dessert for $218. I chose the Hiroshima oysters and clams Provence style.0The appetizer was (from left to right) tuna cerviche topped with black fish roe, Japanese potato salad and mixed greens with sesame dressing The cerviche was refreshing and nicely complemented with the crunchy roe on top. The potato salad was creamy and what I like about Japanese potato salad. The mixed salad, however, was ok but I found a number of browning greens.0The soup was a crab soup with a heavy handed drizzle of truffle oil and an odd streak of black pepper. This was disappointing because all I could taste was truffle oil. Though I did find lovely chunks of crab meat throughout. The soup was also very VERY creamy.0Then my main arrived. This was fabulous! Lots of clams with meat in each one. There were also 2 big Hiroshima oysters. The seafood was cooked perfectly. But it was the sauce was the winner. A rich tomato based sauce that was fragrant with an added kick of heat from the chili added.0This came with a plate of garlic black pepper rice. A welcome addition to soak up as much of that wonderful sauce as possible.0Dessert was a choice of roll cake or creme brulee. Roll cake was my only choice and I was not disappointed. A soft sesame roll cake with a sakura cream. It was not too sweet and was a total highlight.0My drink was an ice orange tea. This was nice and refreshing with a whole piece of orange in it. The tea wasn\'t infused with orange flavor so I had to poke at the pulp to release orange flavor.0The food was quite good. Well, aside from the mediocre appetizer and over truffle oil soup. But the rest was astouding. The only thing I didn\'t like and is reason I really won\'t be back or at least create extreme hesitation for me to return is the service. First, I wasn\'t provided with a menu. Then when I was provided with one, I was expected to order like some sort of cha chan teng. Next when my food arrived, the waiter noticed I had no eating utensils. Then he noticed he didn\'t even wipe the table. Don\'t you do these things before your diner sits down? Another thing was how fast everything came out. I had EVERYTHING in front of me (including dessert and drink) at once. I guess if you want a fast lunch, this is the place for you. If you want a quiet relaxing lunch this may not be for you. It\'s sad really as I did like the food. It\'s too bad the service made me think twice. And thus, my happy face gets pushed to an ok.', ""Had family brunch here last weekend (7 people + 1 baby) and we were impressed. In a quiet, leafy alley off Hollywood Road and Gough Street, is this charming restaurant with friendly French service who gets everything done in the suavest of ways.It may be in the centre of things (right below PMQ) but you feel like you're in your own little haven in the crossroads of Central / NoHo / Sheung Wan.Downstairs you have the wine bar with the high table, while upstairs you have the naturally lit balcony / loft restaurant with modern European decoration.We had the whole place to ourselves that morning, such a surprise given its location. Cocotte right across enjoys way more popularity that it boggles us why Figaro doesn't get as much attention. Because it should.Brunch was a simple yet tasty affair costing around HK$150-250 per head. Within that price range you can get yoghurt, muesli, fresh juice, coffee/tea, a croissant, AND hot breakfast - per person.Food presentation was exquisite, and taste was good. Prices more than reasonable.Next time I will take more photos but for now these words will have to do.

Showing a wooden staircase of sushi, i it definitely looked pretty. But as hyped died down, I forgot about it. Until one day, I was thinking of what to have for lunch when I walked by the restaurant.

Menu is in English and Chinese. There are photos of all the food.

Like everyone else in the restaurant, we all got up and took an aerial view.0The set included a miso soup, 6 maki rolls, 4 types of sushi and 5 types of sashimi. Apparently all are whatever is fresh for the day.The miso soup was pretty pathetic. It hardly had any miso taste at all. Just some nori floating about in colored water.0The maki was ok. The filling was minced tuna.0The staff informed me to eat from the bottom to the top of the staircase and that is what I did. The fish was fairly fresh but there wasn't a lot of flavor. Most of the flavor came from the little bit of sauce that was smothered on some of the pieces. Some of the pieces were still dripping in water.

It's a nice gimmick by presenting the food in this way but then again, I think other restaurants are doing the same thing as well. If you just want a nice photo, this is the place for you.

There are plenty of other better burger joints within Wan Chai and the greater area. Honbo, Burger Joys, Butchers Club and Shake Shack all do a better burger.One thing that is unique about Five Guys is the portion size. The normal cheeseburgers are double patty portions with the little burgers one patty size. I would actually recommend the little ones because it\'s simply too much meat... If you\'re looking for fillingness then look no further than Five Guys. You end up rushing to eat the burger because it\'s just a mess to eat - falls apart because its so big... It\'s more greasy than juicy...There is a theme going on here because they certainly have exported the American Notion of ""size does matter"" over to the Fragrant Harbour. We ordered the large fries to share. OMG... did we just dig up a whole field in Idaho and served it up on a plate... Like I grabbed the bag and it was heavy - probably almost 2lbs.. That\'s a lot of fries... In the end we gave up finishing the Cajun fries as it was just too much flavouring and food. Fries are my favourite part of a burger meal but even I was defeated but the twice fried hand cut thick fries are decent, best item on the menu, not that the menu is expansive given the Milkshakes are not on offer yet.No combos is disappointing. You have to pay HK30 for a soda which is refillable but HK30... that\'s more than a Mcdonalds value meal... Reality check pls.... It\'s self service not rip of service.... Makes me angry writing it right now that it costs HK30 for a self serve soda... We definitely needed a drink afterwards... at least Shake Shack has the decency to provide a station with self serve water....Last but not least was the cheese sandwich. What a joke.... it really was a joke for HK45. The bun with two slices of cheese slapped in the middle. It wasn\'t even cooked right.. I could see the lady throwing away several tries - once I saw that I asked for the burgers and fries to be given to me straight away as not to get warm fries and soggy buns... Yeah definitely don\'t get the cheese sandwich - I guarantee it will be the most disappointing thing you will have ordered in a long time.Bacon Cheeseburger$ 900Bacon Cheeseburger$ 90Cajun Fries$ 550Cajun Fries$ 55Grilled Cheese$ 450Grilled Cheese$ 45'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/wan-chai-five-guys/585224?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

212,Fook Lam Moon,Wan Chai,Chinese,4.5,224.0,4.0,"On the last day of the trip we venture to Fook Lam Moon and I have made a mistake in wearing shorts as this dim sum temple is anything but casual. Again there is no concern from the staff and we are made to feel welcome. It does go to show that decor can be the final ingredient, even in HK, for a Michelin star.Everything, and I do mean everything, we try is top quality. This is probably my favourite dim sum experience for the trip. The prawn spring rolls are nothing short of astonishing. Spring rolls are both enticing with their fried crunchy exterior, and often boring by their similarity and familiarity. These are perfect because they have that exterior, but inside the fresh juicy prawns are incredibly flavoursome. I wish I could have some more!The char siu bao, har gow and lo mai gai are all delicious - quality and finesse in every bite. We finish with mango pudding and it is the most familiar to me for the trip with chunks of mango throughout the pudding and mango syrup on top. It's an exciting way to finish the trip."", ""Fook Lam Moon or  has an illustrious reputation of being dubbed the 'Cafeteria for the Wealthy' as it is a Chinese restaurant frequented by the rich and famous. Fook Lam Moon literally translates to 'fortune and blessings arriving at your doorsteps'.The restaurant started in 1948 as a catering service provider for the elite of Hong Kong who threw lavish parties at home. It was known as Fook Kee before renaming itself to Fook Lam Moon upon taking up a customer's suggestion in 1953. To the customers, it always meant good fortune when Fook Lam Moon chefs showed up at their doors since it was a promise of good food. Hall dining in the form of a restaurant was first introduced in the 1970s and in 1989, the restaurant expanded business and moved to its current premise on Johnston Road at Wanchai.Listed in the Asia's Top 20 Restaurants of the Miele Guide, the original restaurant at Wanchai was previously awarded with Michelin 2* while its branch at Tsim Sha Tsui bags 1*. With reference to the recently published Michelin Guide 2013, it seemed that both branches have an equal standing of 1* each. What appealed to us strongly was the underlying philosophy behind Fook Lam Moon's success - a simple fact in using only the best ingredients. The chefs at work were of the opinion that no matter how talented a chef might be, the food would never impress without the use of stellar ingredients.Admittedly, it was with a high level of expectation that we set foot to Fook Lam Moon. Can it still impress our picky palate?The ground floor was used as a lobby or rather waiting area for diners. There were two receptionists who would communicate with the manager at the restaurant to facilitate an orderly fashion of ushering customers to their tables on the upper floor. When a table was ready, the lady would send you in one of the two lifts to the 1st floor. It was truly an experience of exclusivity as you would not expect to share a lift with other diners.It was no joke when the media label this place the Cafeteria of the Wealthy. The interior of the restaurant was posh and classy. There were a few elders who visited after us and they were politely greeted by their surnames and shown to their usual table. There were wooden side stools at each table, thoughtfully placed for diners to place their bags and belongings.To be completely honest, I felt rather intimidated as the servers, who were mainly males in their 40-50s, were rather mercenary. Yes, we did not show up dressed like we were filthy rich but while the service was professional, it lacked warmth and heart like our experience at Dim Sum Square. It came across as too commercial for my liking. The service was immaculate where the basic duties were all duly executed and it was easy to fetch their attention but somehow I felt like I was constantly being judged.The dim sum dishes were divided by the methods of preparation namely steamed, deep-fried, specials and desserts. Each dish ranged between HK$50 - HK$140 and Chinese tea was served at HK$20 per person.The  tea we ordered was rich and fragrant and premium tea leaves were used which gradually grew in size after being submerged in hot water. The tea-pot also had an internal filter to block out any loose leaves, leaving each cup of Chinese tea clean.Steamed prawn dumplings, har gaw -  (HK$60/-)Steamed prawn dumplings, har gaw -  (HK$60/-)0Steamed prawn dumplings, har gaw -  (HK$60/-)Thinly wrapped by a translucent dumpling skin, it packed a punch of texture with the fresh succulent prawns which were moist with a slightly firm crunch. What we enjoyed about this simple har gaw was that the main ingredient, prawns, were fresh unlike the typical poor grade crunchy prawns typically used for the dish. Flavour-wise, it tasted rather bland and mild but this allowed the natural sweetness of the prawns to shine. For those who crave for a strong flavour, I suggest requesting the XO chilli oil sauce from the servers. It is not usually offered but this sauce blew us away with a perfect balance in savouriness and heat.Minced pork dumpling, siew mai -  (HK$60/-)Minced pork dumpling, siew mai -  (HK$60/-)0Minced pork dumpling, siew mai -  (HK$60/-)The pork used was fresh which did not have that appalling porky taste and the seasoning to it was light and bland. What fell apart for the dish, literally too, was the thin dumpling skin which was sticky and failed to hold the dumpling firmly together. For those who hold their chopsticks poorly like myself would soon find their siew mai either sticking to the cutlery or broken apart. It certainly did not par as well as its BFF on this instance but apart from the skin, we enjoyed every single bit of this innocent-looking dumpling.Pan-fried radish cake, lo bak go -  (HK$60/-)Pan-fried radish cake, lo bak go -  (HK$60/-)0Pan-fried radish cake, lo bak go -  (HK$60/-)In the world of dim sum, I always think that three dishes must be present on the table. They are like BFF and one cannot exist without the other and they are none other than har gaw, siew mai and lo bak go. On that basis, this simple yet classic dim sum had to be featured. It was done perfectly, pan-fried to a crisp surface and mashy soft on the inside which could melt in your mouth. The radish tasted really smooth and on its own, carried a hint of subtle fragrance. Certainly a class of its own.Barbecued pork pastry, char siew sou -  (HK$60/-)Barbecued pork pastry, char siew sou -  (HK$60/-)...0Barbecued pork pastry, char siew sou -  (HK$60/-)...Barbecued pork pastry, char siew sou -  (HK$60/-)...0Barbecued pork pastry, char siew sou -  (HK$60/-)...It was our first time trying this type of pastry which was quite unlike the usual char siew sou available at dim sum restaurants. The pastry was butter rich and crumbled like cookies rather than the flaky renditions. The barbecued pork on the inside was finely diced and beautifully seasoned to give a mild sweetness. The choice of cut for the diced barbecued pork was brilliant, with just the right amount of fat to keep it moist and juicy.Steamed salted egg yolk custard bun -  (HK$50/-)Steamed salted egg yolk custard bun -  (HK$50/-)...0Steamed salted egg yolk custard bun -  (HK$50/-)...0This steamed salted egg yolk custard bun scored perfectly in all areas and is currently our top-pick having tried the numerous dim sum restaurants in Hong Kong and Singapore. The bun was fluffy and light with a right amount of chewiness to it. The bun served more like a soft encasing to the warm, rich and dense filling on the inside. As we lightly tore it apart, the generous filling oozed out in plentifulness and it was simply a joy to watch that viscous yellow custard flowing. The flavours were beautifully balanced with just the right amount of sweetness and saltiness to match. We simply could not get enough of these!Halfway through the dishes, I had a sudden craving for roast meats. Between the two of us, we thought it would be wise to request for a halved portion of both the barbecued pork (char siew) and roast pork (siew yuk) and they gladly accepted the order!Mixed roast meat platter of char siew and siew yuk -  - (HK$200/-)Mixed roast meat platter of char siew and siew yuk -  - (HK$200/-)...0Mixed roast meat platter of char siew and siew yuk -  - (HK$200/-)...Mixed roast meat platter of char siew and siew yuk -  - (HK$200/-)...0Mixed roast meat platter of char siew and siew yuk -  - (HK$200/-)...Individual portions of the char siew and siew yuk were priced at HK$200/- each but a mixed platter came at the same price. We are constantly on the hunt for the best char siew and siew yuk, be it in Singapore or Hong Kong. Our top siew yuk used to be from Yung Kee and after trying this, we were left divided about which was the best. Both eateries chose the best cut of the pork belly which had clearly defined layers of fat and leaner portions topped with a very crispy skin which gave a beautiful crackling. Served with mustard, it was sublime and the quality of the mustard at Fook Lam Moon certainly held a winning edge over Yung Kee.The char siew had a good mix of the juicy fats and it matched our palates nicely. It was coated with a rich layer of honey and beautifully roasted to give a succulent taste without dehydrating the meat. It was easily one of the best char siew we ever had!Egg tarts -  - (HK$50/-)Egg tarts -  - (HK$50/-)0Egg tarts -  - (HK$50/-)We waited for more than 30 minutes and the egg tarts were still not served. Apparently the order was neglected and the manager attended to it immediately. The egg tarts, like the rest of the dim sum, were made to order so we waited an additional 15 minutes or so for these to arrive.The flaky pastry was one of the finest we had seen. Freshly baked, the pastry literally melted in our mouths with a rich buttery after-taste which left me reminiscing even at the point of writing! Unfortunately, it lacked a strong enough egg taste and flavour to pair with that beautiful pastry which held the filling.The servers were really attentive and waited till the savoury dim sums were finished before sending us the dessert to round up the meal.Leaf wrapped glutinous dumpling with red bean paste -  (HK$60/-)0Leaf wrapped glutinous dumpling with red bean paste -  (HK$60/-)...0Leaf wrapped glutinous dumpling with red bean paste -  (HK$60/-)...The glutinous dumpling was slightly sticky and chewy. I struggled with my chopsticks so I unglamorously used my hands to pry the fragrant leaf apart before indulging on the red bean dessert. We enjoyed that the red bean was fine and smooth and not overly sweet. The glutinous dumpling also had a hint of the fragrance from the apple leaf. It was a good sweet treat but I would have preferred it more if the glutinous dumpling was not as sticky.Overall, the quality of food was good and to some extent, exceeded our expectations. I did not feel comfortable with the service as mentioned earlier but it might have been my own consciousness acting up. The bill certainly did not come cheap for a dim sum meal but given the quality and experience, we felt that it was worthy of its Michelin star. We would highly recommend to call in advance to place reservations be it for their dim sum or ala carte Chinese dinner in the evenings.The tagline of Cafeteria for the Wealthy for Fook Lam Moon seemed appropriate for each dish was easily double the price that of a normal dim sum eatery in Hong Kong. For the commoners like us, it would certainly be quite a meal to remember!                Supplementary InformationReservations are recommended."", 'Fook Lam Moon, long a Hong Kong institution, has a long history of providing top-rated cantonese cuisine, with prices to match.  Is it worth itGoing for yum cha on Boxing Day, we arrived to find the restaurant surprisingly empty at 12:45pm.  We were promptly seated and tea brought to us.  The hostess also brought over some english dim sum order forms also, although the menu options were considerably less than the standard version.  (Ok for most but if anything special you want, and don\'t have someone who can speak canto, is to get someone to write the dishes you want on paper for you before arrival.)There were just two of us but we ordered eight dishes.  The roasted pork (siu yuk) was heavenly.  Although this can be found all over Hong Kong, the FLM version was perfect, with just the right balance between the crispy skin and the meat marbled with fat.  Wow.Siu Yuk0Siu YukWe ordered the steamed shrimp and vegetable dumplings ().  Not to be confused with the more common ""har gao"" (also offered at FLM), these are made with shrimp mixed with bits of water chestnuts and vegetables.  The skin, very nice and thin and steamed perfectly, complemented the filling without being too sticky or heavy.   We needed some vegetables and went with the choy sum fried with garlic.  Again, nicely done but nothing special compared to other kitchens.  I wanted to try the dau miu (peashoots) since its the season but was overruled....  choy sum0choy sumAlso on order the salt water dumplings (Haam Sui Gao  )....another dim sum standby, these can be too heavy at times, or overly sticky.  These were neither.  The filling was a little similar to the steamed shrimp dumplings mentioned earlier but the texture of the casing makes the taste totally different.  Salt Water Dumplings0Salt Water DumplingsAs if we didn\'t have enough shrimp already, we also went with the fried bean curd skin with shrimp filling.  These were a little oily but the taste was also very fresh.  FLM definitely doesn\'t skimp on the filling, or try to substitute expensive shrimp with cheaper vegetables or starches.I wanted to try the steamed beef tripe ().  While tripe may not be everyone\'s cup of tea, the execution here is excellent.  The tripe is steamed long enough so its tender with just the right amount of chew.  The \'soup\' is made from celery and onion with a taste of something sweet, but I can\'t place it.  In any event, highly recommended.We also went with the spring rolls.  Again, these had a generous filling of shrimp and vegetables.  Actually, it was nearly all large pieces of shrimp.  The rolls themselves were so fat I could barely get half of one in my mouth.To finish off we had the steamed brown sugar cake...light and fluffy, and not too sweet, it was a nice way to end the (very filling) meal.Service was efficient and pleasant.  This place has a reputation for favoring VIP\'s and regular customers but we were treated very well and made to feel welcome even though it was our first visit to the original Wan Chai location.FLM is not cheap, lunch for two was over $600, but for special occasions, or for top notch dim sum in an upscale environment, FLM is well worth a visit.', 'Tea per head was charged HKD20 - you should set some expectation for this restaurant.Dim sums were all good.Services was excellent.For a normal visit, it would be charged at least HKD130 - 150 per head for simple dim sum selection. 0yummy shrimp dumping and sticky rice bun0yummy shrimp dumping and sticky rice bunnice sticky rice 0nice sticky rice special one made of minced shrimp cake 0special one made of minced shrimp cake yummy barbecue pastry0yummy barbecue pastryHKD20 per head for tea services 0HKD20 per head for tea services', ""So normally my family I have a few dim sum places that we consistently go to. Not necessarily because the food is amazing but more so because my parents, like a lot of people, are creatures of habit. Anyway, for some odd reason my parents decided to book a table to Fook Lam Moon for dim sum on Sunday. I made sure for them to call the night before and reserve the BBQ pork pie & the egg tarts since I was a little concerned with either: 1) Them running out of either dim sums2) Having to wait 10-15 minutes for them to make it Environment: The place is spacious and seating is relatively comfortable for Cantonese restaurants standard. Service: Service was pretty good but not without flaws. For some reason I feel the waiters are a little careless when serving. For example we ordered 2 different pots of tea and one waiter refilled my dad's tea cup without asking him what tea he had. Although with that said he was extremely apologetic and immediately gave my dad a new tea cup with the tea he wanted. Food: We ordered a good selection of dim sum:  BBQ Pork Pie () - Visually the size looks a little sad (it's quite small) but it's big on taste. The pie exterior has kind of a crumbly cookie texture and a great compliment to the 'creaminess' of the BBQ pork. The BBQ pork was very flavorful and in a way the bite size nature of it...was just right contrary to my initial impression. Yum.  Steamed Crystal Prawn Dumplings () - I think in terms of prawn dumplings this is pretty close to perfection. The skin was perfect thickness and the prawns had great 'prawn' flavor. One thing that is hard to do is to have a filling that both feels generous and texturally also not too solid. Did it blow my socks off per say? Maybe not...but it was still a very good prawn dumpling.  Pan Fried Cured Meat and Radish Cake () - The radish cake had great consistency/texture but the real star of this dish was the fried cured meat...it was really tasty! The flavor was quite intense but just right. Throw in a little sweet sauce...I quite liked this dish.  Stewed Honeycomb Tripe () - Overall a pretty decent dish and the tripe was quite tender. Although with that said it was about the same tastiness as the stewed tripe dishes at other dim sum places. Pretty decent.  Steamed Rice Rolls With BBQ Pork () - The skin exterior was quite nice and thin while the BBQ pork inside was just as tasty as the BBQ pork in their BBQ pork pie. This was more of subtle dish and was quite good.  Deep Fried Prawn Spring Rolls () - When I first ate this I nearly burnt my tongue since it was piping hot! Overall quite a good dish. The spring roll was super crispy and the filling was quite flavorful.  Deep Fried Prawn Balls () - Fook Lam Moon really knows how to deep fry their dim sum. It's basically the interior of the prawn dumpling but the exterior is like fried shrimp toast () but in ball form. The exterior was really crispy and light while the filling felt substantial and flavorful. No idea why we ordered this dish but I'm glad we did. Tasty.  Fresh Baked Egg Tart () - Another signature item from Fook Lam Moon. The egg custard portion was very creamy and 'eggy' while the pastry portion was light and flaky. It almost completely falls apart when it enters your mouth. I personally favor the western pie crust style egg tarts but these bite sized egg tarts at Fook Lam Moon were of high quality. With all these positive things said about their dim sum I do wanted to mention a minor negative...consistency. We actually ended up order 2 orders of the shrimp dumpling and the egg tart and on both occasions I think our first order was better. Could it have been that our palette reacted differently after eating so many other dim sums? Maybe...but my here's my minor gripe about them:  2nd order of shrimp dumplings - Still a very good shrimp dumpling but this time it was slightly overcooked so the shrimp filling feel a tiny bit dry and more solid.  2nd order of egg tarts - I think they overcooked this slightly as well since the pastry feel more 'cookie dough-like'. Although still quite good the pastry took a little more chewing unlike the earlier light and flaky egg tart we had.  Overall I see value in these higher priced dim sum dishes from Fook Lam Moon. Would definitely come back again for dim sum.

I work in Central and there are not a lot of options for vegetarians.The food is really, really good. You get two choices, which you can point to outside or take a look and tell the waitress the numbers for if you don't speak Cantonese. Then the rice, the noodles and soup are all serve-yourself. For only 28 (just white rice, no soup) to 35 dollars (help-yourself rice, fried noodles, and soup), it is incredible value for the food which is tasty and leaves you very full.Sometimes it can be a little busy and the staff seem a little hectic, but the people who work there are all kind. They always say hello and smile at me even though I don't speak the language.I recommend not going directly at lunch time (12:30-1:30 seems to be the most busy), but other times are fine.

There was a generous amount. Broccoli with Lotus Roots - crunchy cooked with ginger and garlic.

Overall speaking, if it earns a Michelin star, probably becoz it is associated with Bo Innovation or due to their service.....  at least, i wont pay a visit to there again. 00', 'London-born, Canada-raised Demon chef Alvin Leung is reflexing his creative muscles again. After launching Plato 86, a Spanish tapas bar at Brim 28 not too long ago, he\'s back at it with another new concept - Forbidden Duck (), a Cantonese restaurant that specializes in the famous Peking duck.0A giant duck with a delightful smile welcomes diners with its wings wide open at the front of the restaurant on the tenth floor of Times Square.1Honestly, I didn\'t know what to expect from Forbidden Duck which has just soft-opened for 4 days. Would there be molecular twist to some of the classic Cantonese dim sums? I was interested to find out more.1I took a quick peek at the open kitchen through the glass windows and saw nothing but marinated ducks hanging next to the oven.0Not a lot of choices in the lunch menu. Just under 20 different dim sums to choose from and interestingly, a special section dedicated to rice rolls.

Perhaps some molecular cheung fun to start the meal?Well, I\'m afraid I got a little too carried away there. That\'s nothing more than a typical sauted rice rolls with XO sauce except that they have added thin slices of duck meat to match their theme. Decent but nothing to really write home about.Sauted rice rolls with shredded duck meat and XO sauce (XO)...$ 480Sauted rice rolls with shredded duck meat and XO sauce (XO)...$ 48Pan-fried dumplings with black truffle and duck meat () ($42) - I didn\'t remember when Cantonese restaurants started adding black truffles to their dim sums but they seemed to have over-done it in recent years by adding black truffles to pretty much everything.

This would have passed if I was getting it from a street vendor but definitely not from an upscale restaurant.Pan-fried dumplings with black truffle and duck meat ()...$ 420Pan-fried dumplings with black truffle and duck meat ()...$ 42Peking duck () (Half duck $228) - This was what we came for, their bread-and-butter signature dish. There are two types of Peking duck served here:- the typical roasted Peking duck and one that was done using the ""slow-roasted"" method. The slow-roasted one was the one that I really wanted to try but unfortunately, it\'s not available at lunch. So, we had to settle for the former.Peking duck ()$ 2281Peking duck ()$ 228Pancake and the usual condiments of cucumber, fresh onion and melon.01They had the crispy skin and duck meat served separately which was particularly nice as we got to mix and match based on our own preference. The duck was pretty good, the skin especially tender and crisp, the meat pleasant and juicy. I would rate it in the same ball park with its competition like Empire City Roasted Duck () and perhaps a shade higher than places like M&C Duck.1Lettuce wrap with sauted duck meat French-style () (Supplement $70) - We went with the additional dish of lettuce wrap. Between four styles of diced duck meat, we picked the French style although we had trouble telling the difference between this and the ""black pepper style"". At first we thought they messed up our order by serving us one with black pepper (even our server thought that was the case) but it was later confirmed that they got it right.For $70 more, it\'s not a bad addition at all. On top of the diced duck meat were carrots, celery, onion as well as small cubes of foie gras and black truffle to make it French (I suppose).Lettuce wrap with sauted duck meat French-style ()...$ 701Lettuce wrap with sauted duck meat French-style ()...$ 70Fried egg noodle with shredded pork () ($108) - After four dishes centered around duck, we thought we should finish up the meal with a dish without our beloved poultry.Fried egg noodle with shredded pork () $ 1080Fried egg noodle with shredded pork () $ 108I heard the lady next to us complaining to the restaurant manager about her fried egg noodle being way too crunchy but hey, that\'s how I wanted it done!

The sauce with shredded pork and bean sprout was served on the side so we could add as much (or little) as we liked.1I was really looking forward to chef Alvin\'s contemporary take on some of our classic Cantonese dim sums but I came up empty.

The lunch sets for one range from around $80-100, for four persons $370. Sets come with daily and rice or chicken oil rice for a few dollars extra. They have a dim sum menu too. Also breakfast (from 7am) and tea sets.I thought about orderingthe sweet and sour pork or beef with rice noodles, but settled on the Signature chicken in bittern sauce with chicken oil rice at $88. I had a voucher for free steamed buns, which turned out to be steamed shrimp dumplings, ha gow.Great choice, the meal was similar to Hainan Chicken, beautifully presented with sides of spring onion and chilli dipping sauces, cucumber, tomato and lettuce. The chicken was mostly boneless, served at room temperature and very moist and succulent. The rice was excellent too. The four translucent har gow were plump and very juicy, two shrimp in each.The soup was chicken and was quite strong, not really to my taste,total bill was a little over $100 with the tea charge.I'll be back with my familly next time to try out the set meal for four; half a signature chicken, chicken oil rice and two main courses from a list of around ten, soup.

So, restaurant chains have been coming up with a new branches with a young design and feel to attract them.Fortune Young is one such place. With a spacious setting that looked more like something from a cafe than a Chinese restaurant. I decided to come here for lunch where the staff asks how they should greet you in a bid to offer a more familiar and friendly service.During lunch session, they offer this set that is pretty convenient for one. They also offer a la carte. Menu is in English and Chinese. You check off what you want on a piece of paper.0The dim sum came in two baskets. This was the steamed rose floret bun, steamed pumpkin, glutinous rice and lard dumpling and steamed shrimp with pork, egg and tomato dumplings.0The rose bun came with a jar of rose scented condensed milk.0This was the purple potato bun.0The rose floret bun was shaped like a rose with rose petals on it. It was basically a mantou bun.0However, it was stuffed with a sweet red bean paste that was quite good. It came with rose scented condensed milk. I really couldn't taste any rose other than the petals that were dropped into it.0The pumpkin glutinous rice and lard dumpling was pretty cute as it did look like a pumpkin.0Inside was glutinous rice that was pretty sweet tasting.0This was probably my favorite. The shrimp dumplings with pork, tomato and egg. It tasted just like the ever popular scrambled eggs with tomato and shrimp.0It really had scrambled egg in it!0The purple potato bun was super cute as it was shaped like a cat.0The bun had a slight sweet taste. The purple potato filling was not too sweet as well. I liked it enough.0Food was pretty decent. Not too bad and super cute. Would probably return again with a friend to try out the a la carte next time.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-fortune-young/506187?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

The soup was sweet and delicate, but the beef broth wasnt strong enough.5/1005/10Asparagus & Parmesan RisottoI dont think the chef has the Italian blood; it was a nightmare for diners. I reckon he goes to gym too often that his bicep is too strong to stir the rice. Excessive amount of parmesan cheese was added and overcooked the risotto. However, the asparagus was perfectly cooked. 3/1003/10Seafood LinguineThe linguine was cooked to perfection, al dente. The dish was nicely seasoned, but the seafood was overdone.4/1004/10Cherry ClafoutiPrefer a sweeter vanilla custard cream with the cherry.

220,Fruit Stop Health Food Restaurant,Causeway Bay,Chinese,3.6,55.0,1.0,"Haven't been back to this restaurant and went back this day.They still serve the set lunch - many choices offered.I ordered the grilled fish with raw rice. It came with the carrot soup and oat and then the main dish. The fish was done well and the presentation was pretty - you could see those healthy vegitables. Good deal during the lunch time. okay0okay"", 'Came here in the afternoon after a gym workout.  Figured I should keep with the healthy mode I was in.  This place is one of those places you won\'t stumble upon since its located in Lee Theatre and there isn\'t a big sign or on the ground floor, so people that come here - come here with a purpose.   I\'ve noticed this place before when I\'ve eaten at Sorabol (17th floor, best Korean btw).   But after the gym, I just wanted something that wouldn\'t make me feel guilty....Food:  Was still in time for the lunch set (12pm-4pm or so), ranging from like $40 to like $55 or so.  Entree comes with choice of drink or soup.  Every food/drink item has a calorie count and they are very in-line with the healthy theme!Minced chicken, water chestnuts, mushrooms patty over this pink rice and veggies:  Surprised about the huge portion. Didn\'t expect a patty either, but it was sooo goood - tasted like home-made Chinese pork patties - but a lighter healthier and might I add...tastier alternative!  Water chestnuts was a nice touch to the texture.  Also was drizzled in some sauce - but no matter, bc it paired well with the food.  Also came with lots of fresh veggies that also tasted homecooked:  cooked cucumbers, winter melon, broccoli, carrots, califlower!  All very fresh and had a light sauce  (wasn\'t the dry type) and went well with the chicken patty and the rice.  The rice was a healthier option than white, but I forgot what it was exactly, it definitely wasn\'t brown, possibly red rice bc it was slightly pink with bits of red grains.  Sole filet over brown rice and veggies:  Another hit!  The fish came as a big white fish filet portion and came without any skin.  It was seasoned well and cooked to the right temperature. Came topped with mango sauce with small mango pieces - wished they put more of this sauce since it paired well with the fish and veggies. The veggies were the same as above.  I preferred the brown rice - I like the chewier texture. Ordered apple tea and this was very refreshing and wasn\'t too sweet, only hint of sweetness.  What I also appreciated was the fact this food was cooked with low salt!Service:  Average.  Food took a little longer than expected, but after we saw our entrees, we knew why - this isn\'t one of those on the street joints where they throw together a dish - everything was very presentable and cooked fresh.  Sizing it up:  I may be a bit excited about this restaurant (a good thing), but this may turn out to be my after-the-gym spot!  I am not aware of any healthy-themed restaurants in CWB, not even a Subway\'s sandwiches....  The value of the lunch set was very good and the fact that they can make healthy food taste good just blew me away!  And one thing I must emphasize was that I ate everything on my plate (except for half of the rice, trying to be low carb) and at the end I didn\'t feel ""heavy"" with food, which is a great feeling.  Supposedly being like 60-70% full is a good full, I felt on the mark.   In terms of seating, there isn\'t that much seating, but I think this one of those places that will do well with pick-up and delivery.  Only had a taste of 2 lunch sets, but can\'t wait to try other things on the menu.'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-fruit-stop-health-food-restaurant/12662?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

It was actually quite delicious although a bit too oily too as we finished it off.We were lucky enough to get 2 seats by the window with some privacy. Service was pretty efficient.

223,Fu Sing Shark Fin Seafood Restaurant,Wan Chai,Chinese,3.2,184.0,0.0,"Our family used to be regulars at Fu Sing a few years ago. The food was pretty good, and the service was not bad either, but we stopped going to Fu Sing after an incident where the servers made my vulnerable grandmother buy so many Dragon Boat Festival rice dumplings that we couldn\'t finish them! Our family doesn\'t buy festive foods from restaurants, so we were definitely turned off by the incident and stayed away from Fu Sing for quite a few years.Two weeks ago, my grandmother decided late Friday night that she wanted to have dim sum lunch on Sunday. It was already close to 11pm when she told us, so we had trouble finding a restaurant that would be comfortable and easily accessible for grandma that we haven\'t been to recently. My aunt finally decided to book a table at Fu Sing since it\'s the only place she could think of and was able to make a reservation.The restaurant is located in a commercial building in Wanchai where they is an elevator dedicated to the few restaurants on the lower levels. Inside the elevator and in the lobby of the restaurant, there were posters advertising Fu Sing as ""Michelin recommended restaurant"" I was hoping that means the food quality and service were up to par for a renowned restaurant.As soon as we arrived with grandma at the restaurant, the servers were greeting my grandma, ""Mrs. X! You haven\'t been here for so long!"" It\'s been a few years, but they still remember her. I might be biased, but it seemed like they just saw dollar signs all over her.Grandma looked over the dim sum ordering papers and after she was done checking off the items she wanted, she let me go over them and add any additional items that the rest of us wanted.Unlike most restaurants, Fu Sing didn\'t print out our order list from the computer. This would become a problem as we progress through our meal.The first item to arrive were the Baked Char Siu Baus.Baked Char Siu Bau1Baked Char Siu BauBaked Char Siu Bau1Baked Char Siu BauThe Baked Char Siu Baus were very good with the crispy sugar pastry crust. This was probably the best dim sum of the meal.After we were done eating the baked char siu bau, we were wondering if we ordered the traditional steamed char siu bau, so we told the server that we weren\'t sure if we ordered steamed char siu bau and would like to add 1 order of char siu bau. I\'m not sure if the server didn\'t catch the part where we said we weren\'t sure if we ordered them, but we ended up with 3 orders of char siu bau. Apparently, grandma ordered 2 orders in our initial order, and with the additional order we placed later, we ended with 3 orders. We would not have ran into this problem if they printed out our order in the first place. It\'s not entirely the server\'s fault, but we\'ve had other restaurants that would come back and inquire about duplicated orders. Also, we didn\'t appreciate that the servers yelled at us when we asked about the order.Har Gow1Har GowThe Har Gows were disappointing. The outer layer broke when we picked up the dumpling as it was overly moist and fell apart.Bamboo Shoot Dumpling1Bamboo Shoot DumplingI ordered a Fried Bamboo Shoot Dumpling and had no idea this carrot-shaped dumpling was what I ordered as the server didn\'t tell us the name of the dishes as they were served. I can understand not telling us if it was something familiar like har gow or char shiu bau, but this isn\'t what I\'d expect a bamboo shoot dumpling to look like. Also, we couldn\'t believe that a high calibre restaurant like Fu Sing would need to copy other restaurants\' original items. We\'ve had a carrot-shaped dumpling before, but it was in a planter with charcoal spare ribs and it was a different kind of dumpling. 1The dumpling was decent and the bamboo shoot filling was pretty tasty, but the carrot tops, which were bits of lettuce, were wilted and not all that appetizing to look at.Fried Rice Cake with Chinese Sausage1Fried Rice Cake with Chinese SausageThe Fried Rice Cake with Chinese Sausage was delectable with savory Chinese sausage complementing the sweetness of the chewy rice cake!Char Siu Bau1Char Siu BauChar Siu Bau1Char Siu BauThis Char Siu Bau was quite disappointing! The barbecue pork filling lacked flavor and was overly sweet.Turnip Cake with Minced Shrimp1Turnip Cake with Minced ShrimpI really wanted turnip cake, so I ordered it even though it came with minced shrimp, and I really shouldn\'t have! There was way too much shrimp paste for the small piece of turnip cake. All I could taste was the shrimp flavor, and the texture was no longer the softness of the turnip cake as the bounciness of the shrimp paste took over completely.Fried Pork Dumpling 1Fried Pork Dumpling The Fried Pork Dumpling was pretty good as it wasn\'t too greasy and there was a decent amount of filling.Sticky Rice Wrapped in Lotus Leaf1Sticky Rice Wrapped in Lotus LeafI didn\'t eat this rice dumpling, but my brother told me to take a picture because this is one of those dumplings where they steam up a big batch of sticky rice, cut it up into portions and wrap them in lotus leaf. We expected Fu Sing to make this traditionally by wrapping individual portions of sticky rice in lotus leaf before steaming them. Also, we were a little astonished by the portion of rice in the dumpling. My brother opened up the rice dumpling and asked, ""Where\'s the other half of the rice?""Plate--chipped on all 4 sides1Plate--chipped on all 4 sidesMy aunt told me to take this picture, as she noticed all four sides of the plate were chipped!Beancurd Sheet Sweet Soup1Beancurd Sheet Sweet SoupI\'ve said that free food is good food, and this Beancurd Sheet Sweet Soup was complimentary. It tasted fine, but I expected it to be thicker in texture as I could see that all the beancurd sheets had melted away.As a restaurant that advertises itself as ""Michelin recommended"", the food quality and service were not up to par at Fu Sing. The food quality was underwhelming with a few dishes that had issues. The service was no where near where it should be. Our plates were not changed throughout the meal. The staff talked to us bluntly, and when we inquired about the mix up with the char siu bun order, they gave us an attitude. The food quality and service would be passable for an average neighborhood Cantonese restaurant, but at close to $300 per person, we expected more!', 'This is not the first time I have visited Fu Sing, who is kwnon for its signature char siew. Fu Sing is also known to be one of the ""rich men\'s canteen"", so don\'t be surprised if you spot celebrities or socialites sitting near you.The restaurant was filled to the brim during lunch hour, and atmosphere was noisy as almost everybody is talking at the same time. This is a very typical scene not unlike what you see in TVB dramas.The char siew was up to its usual standard, a good mix of fatty parts and meat, with sticky honey glaze and a almost buttery taste. It is this unique taste that bring customers back repeatedly. Honestly, I like it, but I don\'t love it the way others do. I like mine done the traditional way. The plump shrimp dumplings (ie har gao) are pretty good too, translucent little parcels filled with shrimp and bamboo shoot. I also like their ham sui kok, which is essentially a mix of meat, mushrooms and other stuff wrapped in a glutinous rice pastry and deep fried. Less than satisfactory items included the wantons in chili oil, which was quite bland and not spicy at all. The fried XO rice rolls were a little dry and stuck to each other, but that could possibly be due to the fact that they were served up quite early on.Despite the hits and misses, we will come back again. Just have to order more carefully. From memory, their salted yolk custard buns were fabulous!Har Gao0Har Gao', ""We booked a table in advance. However, we'd still have to wait upon our arrival. We're told that the booking did not mean anything at all. It was very messy at the front desk. The receptionist did not know how to manage the busy crowds and customers - most of them actually had called before their arrivals.  It was okay that we waited for abou 15 minutes and we're given a table. We ordered few dim sums and we waited for about 1/2 hour before we got to know our orders/ dim sums actually got missing.   The waiter came over and asked us to order again-he would be following up after we showed our disappointed look. The dim sums' quality was okay.

Can't wait to go back there.The fried fish balls was one of the daily specials for that day, and it was delicious! Crispy on the outside, beautifully bouncy on the inside and the hint of fragrant coriander made it just perfect.

Thin and chewy skin with juicy and succulent fat shrimps inside.

Light, flaky, not greasy, with tasty filling.The savory sticky rice uses mixed grain, which I love...and it has subtly flavored filling, which is nicely balanced with the rich salted egg yolk. Precious!On to the sweets...love their the custard yolk buns. Fluffy bun with runny custardy, yolky, sweet filling. Sigh...I miss them already! I am not a big fan of grapefruit...but I must admit that it has a certain refreshing quality, perfect to balance the richness of this sweet and creamy mango grapefruit dessert. Each and every spoonful has chunks of mangoes.

From its appearance its more or less like a fusion style noodle although it consist of a good amount of Japanese ingredients include, scallop, salmon roe, soft boiled egg and uni (which used to make the sauce). The uni cream sauce was pretty light but goes well with all the stuff, with a sprinkle of spring onion and some truffle, making it a tasty fusion lo mein (aka stir noodle).11The rest of the 2 main dish were tsukemen1the first one was covered by a good portion of sakura shrimp, just like a sakura shrimp pork bone soup bath for the noodle. A fully flavored soup base and those sakura shrimp added an additional layer of texture for the noodle, it was pretty good, apparently this option is targeted to female diners, which is a smart move, the unique aroma of sakura shrimp and its appearance is pretty attractive.11And the other one was pork bone soup bath with extra strong flavor, which is more for a guy thing, the noodle thickness is different from the one we had for sakura shrimp, which is for the noodle to absorb the optimum taste of the soup. Both of the soup base are very rich and strong , since it isnt a soup noodle, but a tsukemen.11One thing I liked about this place is the mini stove that they have it on every table, for you to heat up the soup since the soup base would get cold from time to time when we eat, which is indeed a very caring thoughts for guests. I have been told we can order some rice to make it a special congee with the soup base, we were too full for it so we couldnt make it happen.Anyways I would say the price range is good, and with thoughtful settings and interesting ideas and combinations, maybe I should try out their seasonal item, ramen with oyster, sometime within this month.', ""Tsukemen ramen is basically ramen where the soup is served on the side and you dip the ramen noodles into the soup like you would for cold somen. It's a different type of eating ramen. There are currently two ramen restaurants in Hong Kong that specialize in this form of ramen eating. One is Kakurega Ramen Factory, located in Sham Shiu Po. The other is Fujiyama 55 located in Tsim Sha Tsui East. I've tried both and both are good. Fujiyama 55 now decided to head into Hong Kong Island with a new branch in Causeway Bay. Located behind Royal Garden Hotel, the shop is pretty small. It's smaller than the Tsim Sha Tsui East branch. Decor is your usual ramen restaurant. Open kitchen on one end. Bar tables and small cramped tables surround it.0They give you the usual ramen menu where you check off what you want and any sides, etc. However, the menu is all in Chinese (no English) though they are very helpful in explaining what is served. They do serve regular ramen but I was here for tsukemen so I chose that and non spicy. Ramen includes spring onion, bamboo shoots and half an egg. ($78).2For those unsure how to eat tsukemen, they have a pictorial instruction sheet. You dip your noodles into the soup. Try not to dip too many strands of noodles in one go. Go 3 strands at a time or too much soup is soaked up and it gets way too salty. If the soup gets cold, they have heaters on next to you so you can heat up your soup or at least keep it a warm temperature. Good for cold days! For added $20 and you are not full from the noodles, you get a bowl of rice with cheese. You then put that into the soup and continue to heat it up. There you finish your meal with cheesy rice goodness.instructions on how to eat tsukemen0instructions on how to eat tsukemenMy meal came like this. The soup was strong and sweet. Not overly salty. I tend to toss all my char siu and spring onions and bamboo shoots into the soup and heat it up on the heater at this point before dipping my noodles.3Noodles were thicker than usual ramen. Almost as thick as udon. It was springy and smooth. Quite good noodles. Char siu tasted a lot like bacon so if you love bacon, this is for you. Egg was runny and lightly seasoned. Portion size is small and you can easily order a round of rice and cheese with this. However, I wasn't in the mood for rice so skipped this step.3Will be back as an alternative to my usual ramen love. Glad this branch is so close to me now so I don't have to go to Tsim Sha Tsui East.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-fujiyama-55-ramen-tsukemen/432688?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

Not only are we swamped with enless tasks and back-to-back deadlines, but in the age of mobile devices, getting away from work to enjoy a nice break almost seems laughable.But just when you thought that the notion of a little escape is out of reach,enter Fuku by Nishimura. When it comes to a nice place to have a quiet lunch, this place is an absolute gem.Nustled in a tiny corner of Admiralty, this place is an oasis right from the moment you enter the shop. The whole restaurant is nicely decorated, but most importantly the layout is effectively spaced and compartmentalized to facilitate quiet conversation.Furthermore, we were seated in alarge booth, offering maximum comfort and privacy - first class dining if there ever was such a thing. (But do make sure that you book well in advance)The avaliable food selection was adequate and we ended settling on the Tuna Rice and Assorted Sushi lunch sets.The sushi set was well portioned and would definitely keep you full for the afternoon slog, especially with the udon. Sure,the seafood was fresh and there was sufficient variety, but aside from this, the meal didn't really stand out. For example, there were no items that demonstrated extraordinary flair or creativity, which is what you would expect to come with the price premium.Things took a turn for the better however, with the arrival of the tuna don. The dish was beautifully presented with fat juicy slices of fish laid out on the fluffy serving of rice. Simplicity at it's finest, the freshness of the dish really came through.The bill, at alomost $400 per head, was not cheap, but given that Fuku by Nishimura offers one of the best place for a quiet escape, I'd say the price premium was well worth itTopped of with choice of dessert or drinks our meal was made complete with a nice chat over coffee, in this mini oasis.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-fuku-by-nishimura/469081?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

The noodles were super super al dente (one of my lunch partners said it was too al dente for himbut I liked it)! The soup was very very rich in fish and was kept hot served in the pot! The egg was cooked so well that the egg yolk was flowing out like lava!

It was also very cheap, at a cost of $15 only!Overall, I think the dipping noodles and the soup were better than ', 'Having tried quite some times ramen in Wan Chai area, first time to do Tsukemen here. Something different from Ramen but still in Japanese style - most suitable for Japan-lovers, like me!It was around 12:30pm on a normal working day and there had been quite some people waiting upon our arrival. But good that we just had to wait around 5mins and were seated.00It was quite spacious and got quite some tables. Apart from normal tables for groups, there were also bar table for single eaters. Really considerate for sole eaters!0As expected, Tsukemen was the top highlight in the menu that occupied most of the portion. Besides, it also did ramen. 00Something interesting was that it allowed us to choose the noodle amount - 200g / 300g / 400g / 800g. Only choosing 800g had to pay $45 more. Suitable for big eaters like me!Finally we chose two Tsukemen sets:1) Tsukemen with vegetable and pork dice (): The soup had a rich taste - not too salty but had a strong fish taste. From the poster, it said that the soup wascooked with pork bones for more than 10hrs and much minced fish powder were added. Really up to its descriptions! Besides, the soup was rather thick that it could stick on the noodles! About the toppings, there were quite some vegetables and pork slices. The pork was soft but not too fat and the vegetable portion was large - suitable for healthy eaters!Tsukemen with vegetable and pork dice 1Tsukemen with vegetable and pork dice Tsukemen with vegetable and pork dice 0Tsukemen with vegetable and pork dice Tsukemen with vegetable and pork dice 0Tsukemen with vegetable and pork dice 2) Tsukemen with egg(): The soup was the same as the one above but the toppings were differet.

Really interesting!0', 'Recent years there\'s been an addition in Hong Kong to the traditional Japanese ramen, I see more and more operators tapping into the so called ""dipping"" ramen (sorry I\'m not sure about what the actual term of  is and I\'m too lazy to Google). Being different to the soup based ramen that is more mass market, the soup (or sauce I should say) and the noodle are separate. As you can imagine, the sauce will be quite rich and thick as you need to dip the noodle into the sauce in order to get the taste. The sauce in Fuunmaru is made by fish and pork bone, I really enjoyed the freshness of the sauce. The sauce comes in a very hot stone pot, you\'re given the freedom to season it with pepper, spicy powder and garlic powder. The overall experience is pretty good, you\'re allowed to pick between cold noodle or warm noodle which I should advise everyone to go for cold noodle instead (simply for the fact that since the sauce is really hot so your noodle becomes warm eventually and cold noodle is probably more chewy). The one I ordered is their signature noodle so it\'s got a bit of everything there. I definitely liked what I had there. Next time I should go and try their spicy sauce. 00000', ""With a plethora of new ramen shops cropping throughout the city on a frequent basis, there is a new one in town that has peaked my interest of late. Fuunmaru, Yes, a pretty funny name. A chain of ramen restaurants from Japan who''s parent ramen branch is Bariuma, Fuunmaru focuses on tsukemen style ramen.Located in Wanchai, it's a fairly large restaurant with both bar tables and regular tables for larger groups.0Menu is in the form of a check off piece of paper. It's in Chinese and English (just flip the piece of paper).0They even have instructions on how to eat the ramen. For those that don't know, you dip the ramen in the concentrated soup. Then after you're done, you dilute the soup with dashi and drink it.0I chose tsukemen with egg in a small portion (200 g). Requested noodles to be warm. Price:: $93. There was a slice of lemon you can squeeze into the broth. I tried it and I really couldn't tell the difference.0The soup was a bonito pork based broth. It was quite rich and strong in flavor.0The noodles were the thick kind and al dente and smooth. I wasn't too keen on the char siu as it was a bit too thickly cut. It was dry and a bit too chewy so having such a thick cut made it even harder to chew on.0The egg was a complete fail. It not only tasted bland but the yolk was overdone and not runny. Sad, I know. Especially even bad ramen places do a decent egg now a days.0Other than the broth being pretty decent, the noodles were not that great. The egg was a complete disappointment and the char siu wasn't that good. They gave me coupons for next time but I'm unsure if I'd return as it really wasn't that good.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/wan-chai-fuunmaru/527537?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
229,GINZA IWA,Central,Japanese,3.7,833.3,0.0,"Having been to Sushi Iwa in Tokyo, we were ecstatic to learn that they have opened up a branch in Hong Kong! Located in the Asia Pacific Center, the elevator will only take you up to the 29/F where its sister teppanyaki restaurant Ginza Iwa Sumibi is at with another flight of stairs for Ginza Iwa specifically. Our friend had made the booking for lunch and I didn't realized that she had booked a table at Ginza Iwa Sumibi instead of Ginza Iwa until I arrived. Due to our party size of 5, my guess was that it was easier to get a table at Sumibi than the limited counter seats at Ginza Iwa. However, I was informed by the staff at Sumibi that we can still order sushi from Ginza Iwa, and the only difference would be that the sushi will not be made in front of us and handed to us one by one. Okay that was fine with us!0The lunch menu at Ginza Iwa had 3 options: Haruat $450, Akiat $800, and Omakaseat $1250. The prices were pretty expensive especially since the omakase for lunch in Tokyo only cost 10,000. I ended up ordering the Haru while J got the Aki.Our lunch sets also came with salad and daikon with beef stew. The salad was average with the standard sesame salad sauce.0The stew was rather interesting with its chewy texture but while the container was super hot, unfortunately the content was not.0After our appetizers, we had to wait quite a while before our sushi finally arrived.The Haru came with 8 pieces of sushi and 4 rolls. The Akami was rather bland while I liked the chewy texture of the Kinmedai. The Aji was interesting with a negi paste on top. The Kohada tasted a bit similar to saba. All the pieces tasted alright but nothing to write home about. The only piece that really stood out was the hotate because it was different as it had been marinated with yuzu. It was intriguing but just not sure if the combination worked for me.010000The Aki came with 12 pieces of sushi and 4 rolls as well. I think the bulk of the sushi was quite similar to Haru but had more higher value items like toro, uni, shrimp, etc. Again, most of the sushi were just average in flavor.The uni was really salty for some reason - as if someone had put salt on it.00The kanpyo rollwhich was made up of simmered gourd was sweet and light to eat.0The dessert we received was warabi mochi, which was perfectly chewy and not too sweet.0Overall, we were very disappointed with the sushi at Ginza Iwa. It actually looked pretty good at first glance, but after eating a couple pieces, we all looked at each other with a perplexed look like 'this is it?' I mean it wasn't bad, but for the price, I was expecting much higher quality and more flavors. Most of the pieces weren't that impressive, let alone memorable. Even the rice was not warm which is what one comes to expect from quality sushi restaurants.I'm still trying to figure out what went wrong. How could our experiences be so different from others? Was it simply because we were not sitting at the sushi counter? If so, then their sister restaurant should not have allowed us to order from Ginza Iwa if they cannot ensure the quality of their food. We felt gypped because the quality of the sushi we got was on par with Fukusuke and yet we were charged double / triple the price."", 'Omakase Classy, if pricey sushi dokoro;Good quality omakase available;Super sensitive and attentive service.Definitely worth a smiling face.  Decor:You have to walk up one level from Ginza Iwa grill before getting here.

Top marks for service.(BB12VIP...0(BB12VIP...The place was simply decorated but elegant.They had about 12 seats all surrounding the sushi bar.

Amazing. (*some of the photos later were from my wife\'s set.)  lll...0lll...Aoyagi (aka Bakagai): orangish & shiny. Looked somewhat like a jackfruit. It had a very interesting crispy/chewy texture. Almost like a cross between a geoduck and black fungi. Interesting. - 0 - Akagai: the Akagai (lit. Red shell) had a really nice pattern. It also had better umami than the Bakagai. - 0 - Shiro ebi: The colour and presentation was quite striking. The taste was similar to normal ebi, but it had an interesting texture. - ...0 - ...Yellowtail: Pretty good. Thinner than usual. I thought it was OK. My wife thought it was slightly fishy though. - 0 - Shirako: This was lightly grilled with a blow torch. Interesting way of preparing shirako. It didn\'t really affect the taste of the Shirako but created an interesting texture on the surface. Very interesting. - 0 - Ankimo & Chawamushi (Steamed egg): - 0 -  -     0 -     Nothingspecial about the chawanmushi but the ankimo was pretty good, filled with umami.Saba : A nice cut of grilled saba . The texture became excellent after heating the skin just a little bit, which melted the fish oil and released the aroma from the saba. I regard this as the highlight of this meal.Very good. - 0 - Akami: I\'ve been very wary of akami ever since my bad experience with it at NOBU. This was not bad, this was marinated in shoyu overnight and had a mild and sweet aftertaste. - Nobu...0 - Nobu...Ootoro : quite good. Aburi. Which really brought out the fragrance of the fish oil. - 0 - Kohada: Obviously, a type of silver fish. It tasted like the saba in a ""box-pressed"" sushi. Indeed, from what I\'ve read, the usual way of preparing this fish is to marinate it in vinegar, like saba. - 0 - Aji with nori negi paste: this seems to me to be a fairly original invention. The black sauce was actually nori mixed with negi. The shiso also tasted pretty good . - 0 - Ikura: Usually Ikura (salmon roes) are marinated in shoyu. These weren\'t, as a result, you could really taste the freshness of the Ikura. Very good. - ...0 - ...As a general observation, the type of rice used was koshihiraki , a top grade rice from Japan. It\'s rounder and harder than usual. The vinegar taste was light.  Pausing here, another point about the service,the chef held the sushis tighter after seeing me use chopsticks! (A tightly packed sushi is easier to handle with a pair of chopsticks but may affect the texture.) Excellent attention to details.    Grilled anago: It did not have any annoying soil taste and was quite crunchy.  - , 0 - , Uni : I\'m not entirely sure where this sea urchin came from. Anyway it was very creamy. Don\'t over do the shoyu.Anago with tare: This was fine. Not spectacular but fresh (I.e without the annoying soil taste.) The egg was fluffy and sweet. Good. - 1 - 0Negitoro: This was the first time that we see negitoro made in this style. It\'s a negitoro roll wrapped in a big piece of nori and made into a parcel instead of being chopped into smaller portions. Some carbs to round off the lunch was much appreciated. - ...0 - ...Conclusion:All in all, the quality of the seafood here was definitely above average with many original ideas displayed. Nevertheless, Some may question whether the quality really justified such a price tag. Having said that, in view of the excellent service, this place is definitely worth a visit for special occasions. - ,0 - , ...0 ...', 'Ever since I was a little kid, I loved eating. I was definitely a lot more picky when I was young, but come on, who isn\'t?Only recently did I start to notice it has developed into some sort of addiction...(okay by recently, I mean the past 2 years). I go to sleep looking forward to waking up for meals and I get excited planning to try out new restaurants with my friends and family. Scrolling through my Instagram feed makes me drool (yes, I follow a lot of foodies), and pretty much all the photos I take are of food. I am not even kidding. My entire Instagram feed, my digital camera, my iPhoto albums are filled...seriously, I\'m addicted.Anyways, I have decided to start sharing photos of food I\'m eating so that more people can go and enjoy good food too!This first post will be about Ginza Iwa ! It is an outlet of the 1 Michelin Star restaurant back in Tokyo, run by head chef Daisuke Suzuki (an apprentice of Iwa-san for over 8 years). Located on the 30/F of Asia Pacific Centre on Wyndam Street, its right above its sister restaurant Ginza Iwa Sumibi, which mainly serves teppanyaki. However, in order to get to the restaurant you have to take the elevator to the 29/F, where the staff will then take you upstairs. (I could only insert 8 pictures, but the rest is on my blog - http://maxinechann.blogspot.ca/2014/01/ginza-iwa.html)The interior of the restaurant is bright and minimalistic, nothing overly fancy, but I liked the use of wood since it was pretty relaxing.Seating Area0Seating AreaBoth times I came here were during lunch; The first time was with my two highschool friends. Because one friend only eats salmon and tamago, we phoned in advance to tell them. They proceeded to tell us that they could accomodate her needs which was very nice of them. My other friend and I decided to get the Haru Set Lunch (), which was $450 and included salad, 8 pieces of sushi, 1 roll, miso soup, steamed egg and dessert.I was super excited because I saw a lot of instagram pictures, and the food looked incredible.The first thing that came was the salad. Just simple greens with wakame, sesame seeds doused in a dressing that tasted like soy sauce but a little more tangy.Salmon Tamago Don0Salmon Tamago DonThis was what the don that they prepared for my friend! I think she paid around $230 for this, which I find is a really good deal. Also, I liked how they included a variety of items and not just pieces of salmon. It had ikura, finely minced salmon toro with negi (in the middle), salmon sashimi, seared salmon as well as finally chunks of tamago.I tried a little bit of hers and it was really good. The different textures really transformed an otherwise ordinary ""salmon tamago don"" into something completely moreish. My friend loved it as well and polished everything in the bowl.I love how clean the table is, everything is so neat! We were just waiting for our food. Although they give you a plate of soy sauce, all the sushi already comes with nikiri (blend of soy sauce) brushed on top, so unless you really enjoy salty food, I would recommend eating the sushi on its own (you can taste the fish better that way too!)Our first piece was hamachi/yellowtail. This was mild and refreshing and you could tell the fish is super fresh. The flesh was nice and chewy and firm. The fish to shari (rice) ratio was also perfect. The rice had more vinegar than the other types of sushi I\'ve had, but I didn\'t mind and actually enjoyed it.It was followed by kinmedai. I don\'t have this type of fish often but I really liked this. This fish is also more on the lean side, but had a really nice crisp and firm texture.Akami0AkamiWhen we were eating our first piece of sushi, Chef Suzuki already started marinating this piece of akami in soy sauce. Before serving, he took it out of the sauce and patted it down with a paper towel. I love how every piece of fish was so fresh, it was truly amazing. Comparatively, the red tuna was softer and took less effort to chew.I did find this a little bit salty though, but my palate is quite sensitive to salty/sweet foods, even when other people find things okay, I tend to find them overly salty/sweet (I\'m quite used to bland food!!). To be honest, even the other pieces were also a little too salty for my liking, but thats okay.Ika0IkaNext up was ika. It was served with a touch of salt on top. I remember my dad first got me to try squid by telling me it was like chewing gum. The texture of this blew my mind. It was clean but at the same time sooo chewy. Probably one of my favorite pieces.Kohada (Gizzard Shad)1Kohada (Gizzard Shad)This was my first time trying kohada...it was good! Taste-wise it reminded me a bit of saba, but at the same time it doesn\'t really taste like saba haha. Its hard to describe.Aji1AjiOmg, looking at this makes me crave it again. This was Aji/Horse Mackerel. The dark blob on top was negi, and boy, this was my favorite of the bunch. The flesh was firm and was just super flavorful. When my friend and I ate this, we just stared at each other in silence...it was that good.The waitress then brought out our steamed egg/chawanmushi. It was silky smooth, and had pieces of crab, mushroom, chicken in it.Our next piece was ikura, each roe was plump and separated from one another. They simply burst in your mouth like a popping wonderland upon the slightest pressure from your tongue!!Anago0AnagoI have never really appreciated anago much, and usually prefer unagi. However, the anago here really makes me think twice...it was buttery, fatty and fell apart so effortlessly...again another amazing piece.Akami, Kanpyo, Cucumber, Negitoro Roll0Akami, Kanpyo, Cucumber, Negitoro RollBecause two people beside us were also having sushi, Chef Suzuki made us 4 different rolls. From left to right it was akami, kanpyo, cucumber and negitoro. My favorites were the kanpyo and the negitoro.We were then served dessert: my friends got the black sesame ice cream, but because I can\'t eat cold stuff, I asked if they could give me something else. My friends said the ice cream was good, but nothing mind blowing.I was served some type of mochi made with some type of leaf and dusted with soybean powder. This was sticky and not too sweet, not bad.We were all full at this point, but not to the point where we had to unzip our pants and go into a food coma afterwards. It was a nicely portioned.Because the people next to us got toro and uni (which looked really good), I came here less than 2 weeks later with my dad to try out the Aki Set Lunch (). This was more expensive, at $800. It included salad, 12 pieces of sushi, 1 roll, miso soup and dessert. For some reason, my dad and I only got 11 pieces?? Not sure....hm...(some pieces are the same as the ones from my last visit!)The first piece was kinmedai, then hamachi, akami.The piece of ika was different from the one I had last time, but even better. It was super chewy and lets just say I really really enjoyed it.Next we had chu-toro. This was super fatty, and the fish oil just coated my tastebuds...they sure were happy campers!Aji again. Still so good.This next piece was baby white shrimp. The flesh was sweet and slightly sticky like amaebi. Sooo fresh!My dad and I first thought that this piece of hotate was cooked...and so I wasn\'t extremely excited. But it wasn\'t, probably just marinated. This was super sweet and tasty too.Can\'t say no to ikura again.Next up was uni  My dad and I were just transported to uni heaven for a little bit there.Anago again, love love love it.Kanpyo rollSo happy I got to try the tamago here. This wasn\'t like the typical egg at other restaurants; it reminded me more of a sweet egg custard, kind of like a pre-dessert. I really enjoyed it though. I want more of it right now.Anyways, I really enjoyed both my trips to Ginza Iwa (although I am still confused about where my 12th piece of sushi went). Both times I requested to be served by Chef Suzuki, but he doesn\'t really speak english or cantonese so if you wanted to talk to your chef about the food or what not, you should probably go with the local chefs. If I were to pick one lunch set though, I would choose Haru. The pieces of sushi served weren\'t that much different, but the price is pretty much double.I would definitely come back again in the future though.'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-ginza-iwa/149641?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

They had a kids high chair but it was actually too low for the high table until they put it on top of one of the chairs!FoodThe order of the menu is odd (drinks up front) and layout makes it difficult to read.For a ramen place, there looked to be only 3 types of ramen - Comment was ""this looks like Ippudo"" - Which I didn\'t find out was true until the bill came!We ordered:Special Curry Ramen - First time we had eaten a black curry ramen.

Not cheap at $178 but there were 2 of each item (egg, bacon & avocado, beef, salmon, beef with enoki mushroom) and all of them were perfectly done. Usually, beef with enoki has the enoki underdone (raw flavor and stringy), but this rendition I could bite in half.ServiceExcellent. Almost nothing required asking.

Of course, all this comes with a price.So, what is someone like me who has a decent amount of money, can't read Chinese and fearful of eating with the cockroaches and still love street food? This is my answer. Boyfriend saw the menu, scoffed and walked away. So, I return on my own!Located in Causeway Bay down Fashion Walk, Gum Jeng is located inside a fashion/lifestyle store called Gum Gum Gum. Gum Gum Gum sells interesting indie clothing and accessories. It was located a couple of stores down and that one sold limited edition Nike and cool pricey men and women's clothing. It then closed and moved here with a little restaurant area. The old store used to also showcase works by local artist, Michael Lau. This one will most likely do the same as for fans of this man will know, Gum Gum Gum is a conceptual collaboration business venture by Michael Lau. For those who don't know who he is, he's pretty popular for his urban graffiti style art work and hip hop style vinyl dolls. He's got a cult following around the world and Nike even hired him to do some work. The man himself was in the restaurant giving an interview when I was eating.You basically come to the counter, order your food, pay cash, sit and wait for your number to be called.

It appeared these were provided by Block 18, the famous doggy noodles place in Jordan. I had visited the real Block 18 a few months ago. Review here: http://www.openrice.com/restaurant/commentdetail.html?commentid=2350968. So, today I eat the same thing served here.condiments0condimentsMy block 18 doggy style noodles took forever to be made. I think I sat a good 30 minutes and there were only 3 people eating. They say the reason is it's all made to order so it takes a while. Yeah, but if Block 18 prepped you their soup base, etc and those guys also make to order and they have a long queue of people waiting to eat, it shouldn't take 30 minutes when the original guys pass out the bowls of noodles within 10 minutes. It was also piping hot. This bowl was warm. Serving size was in a paper bowl and seemed smaller than the original place. It also charged $36 while the original place was only $25. Still, it tasted pretty good. preserved radish made the soup sweet.doggy style noodles0doggy style noodlesfood container0food containerI ordered a roast goose leg, also a specialty of Block 18 and I remembered I loved it when I ate it in Jordan. Block 18 only has a limited supply and they use it as the base of their imitation shark fin soup. But when they have a batch ready, it's sold fast. Here I waited 45 minutes for my goose leg. Jordan, I waited less than 5 minutes. However, there it was wrapped in some slippery piece of paper. This place wrapped it well in a piece of foil. Just like Block 18, it's served dripping in imitation shark fin soup so you get plenty enough soup to try. Leg was delicious. Imitation shark fin soup was overly peppery just like the original place. No idea why it took almost an hour for it when Block 18 prepped everything! Cost $36 where as original Jordon place cost $30.roast goose leg0roast goose legLike all fancy places, there is fancy fruit juices that cost $30. This place serves fruit juices from local organic fresh cold  pressed company, Hyaku. I ordered the green apple, honeydew, lime juice. Wonderful with a touch of ginger.

Trash bins were packed with garbage. I wonder if it's because the staff was busy catering to Michael Lau's needs and didn't empty the trash?Block 18, I paid $60. Here I paid $100.Would I return? Yeah. Cos I eat over priced street food for the air conditioning and hygiene. And I do love the leg.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-gum-jeng/173741?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

It also has a funny smell.  However, since there are not really alternative sushi joints nearby, it is either this or supermarket take-out sushi to satisfy your sushi craving.Cheese with eel roll (): Either this or the Boston roll (salmon with cheese) is one of my must-orders at Genki and did not disappoint.Caramelized fried sweet potato (): Quite well done except unfortunately it is served cold -- I prefer the way it is served in Chinese restaurants which is hot with threads of malt. The outside skin is crispy and coated in caramel and the sweet potato inside is sweet and soft Steamed egg custard: The quality of this is usually good, light and flavorful. Soft shell crab hand roll (): I like ordering the hand rolls as they are made on the spot. This one though was kind of a let down --- the deep fried crab was cold and soggy, and the seaweed was almost impossible to bite through (???) Service is non-existent, impossible to get attention whether or not the restaurant is full. The chefs making the sushi looked tired and despondent  All in all, this is OK if you want to satisfy your sushi craving but definitely not worth the long snaking queues during lunch and I try to avoid too much raw fish here given the cleanliness (lack thereof) of the place!'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/admiralty-genki-sushi/933?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

The corn was still watery from the coming out of the can. The udon was oily. Like super oily. The sushi fell apart when I picked it up with my chopsticks. The tempura shrimp was fried so long, it was hard as rock.The oden was sitting in oil.0I have low expectations for cheap sushi. I really do. But when did Genki Sushi become so bad? It used to be ok. Not great but at least ok for what you pay for. For this, I could have something better elsewhere. Not value for money in the least. I won't be back. Even if my friend insists. I'll take her child to Sushi Express."", ""I had an appointment at Windsor House around 1, so I wanted to grab a quick lunch before the appointment. Since Genki Sushi served lunch sets, I figured the service should be quick. I arrived at Genki around 12:10 and was seated right away.

The hot water tap started to leak afterwards.After about 10 minutes, my lunch arrived, and my uni sushi was placed on the same tray as my lunch set.Lunch set and uni sushi1Lunch set and uni sushiI tried the scallop sashimi first, and it was too warm to my liking. Actually, none of the sashimi was cold at all, which really affected the texture of the fish. The sushi that came with the lunch set was ok, but the sushi rice was a little dry. I didn't expect much from a lunch set at a sushi chain, but the least they could do is get the temperature right.The uni was fresh, but again, the sushi rice was dry, and the nori was not crisp.The overall experience at Genki was ok. The service was decent but not as quick as I hoped, and the food is ok for the price I paid for it.

Breads served with olive oil and vinegar which is perfect!Appetizer : Beef Carpaccio, lemon juice together with balsamic dressing which can bring up the taste of the beef!Pizza : Spinaci Pizza with 5 different types of cheeses (Fontina, gorgonzola, parmigiano, stracchino and mozzarella), pizza is thin and crispy I believe it was a hand made pizza!Pasta : Spaghetti Alle Vongole : traditional dish for Italian restaurant, taste good but just feel a little bit salty!Risotto: Risotto Primavera, risotto al dente, with mixed vegetables and mushroom, taste good!Overall, the environment is perfect, food very Italian traditional taste as the chef is Italian and I believe their target customers are foreign so taste may not very fit the local!', 'Few months ago, Giando quietly replaced Vero Chocolate at the Fenwick Pier. Led by chef-owner Gianni Caprioli (formerly of Isola), this new Italian restaurant and bar has received mixed reviews so far. As a result, we decided to take a closer look by paying a personal visit.0 Giando takes somewhat of a minimalist approach when it comes to interior decoration. Simple wooden floor, white tabletop linen and white leather chairs all contributed to a wonderfully comfortable dining environment.    0 Some bloggers raged about the service level of the waiting staff here but there was no sign of poor service observed under our watchful eyes. To the contrary, we found service to be quite satisfactory. Everyone wore a nice smile on their face. Pink Peppercorn Marinated Salmon (Grade: 3/5)Lunch officially started with salmon marinated with pink peppercorn and served with an Italian fennel orange salad. I liked the texture of the salmon but despite being marinated with peppercorn and herbs, it seemed to lack both the naturally rich flavor of salmon and the added touches from the seasoning.0 Beef Carpaccio (Grade: 4/5)Next up was a pretty impressive beef carpaccio. The thinly sliced beef carpaccio came with very rich flavor with cheese, lemon juice and a balsamic dressing providing the finishing touch. That was a beautiful dish.0 Strozzapreti with Italian Pork Sausage & Broccoli sauce (Grade: 1/5)I always tried to pick at least one pasta when I visited an Italian restaurant. There were all together three pasta dishes available in the lunch menu - penne in an arrabbiata sauce, spaghetti with clams in a white wine sauce and the strozzapreti, a hand-twisted pasta with Italian pork sausage in a broccoli sauce. I picked the latter and was still regretting that decision.To my surprise, the sauce was way too salty and dominant wasting a fairly decent bowl of pasta. Perhaps I should have opted for the spaghetti with clams in white wine sauce instead.0 Mixed Seafood Soupstew in Tomato Wine Broth (Grade: 2.5/5)I called this the Italian version of bouillabaisse. The seafood soupstew was based on a mild tomato and wine broth added with seafood including calamari, clams, shrimps, mussels, and fresh market fish. This was way better than the strozzapreti.0 Panna cotta (Grade: 3/5)There was no sign of any lemon flavor in the panna cotta (though indicated as lemon flavored panna cotta in the menu) but it was nevertheless deliciously creamy. As usual, it was served with mixed berries. Some crunchy caramel on top helped to add a contrasting texture to the mix.0 Giandos Homemade Tiramisu (Grade: 4/5)Soft in texture and perfectly balanced in flavor.

We weren't led down as the beef and pork were juicy and fresh. Meat was tender and nicely marinated. In particular, the beef in steel pot came with a hamburger patty which was a very nice bonus!

I've had better ground chicken sticks elsewhere. This can be given a miss.04)Smoked cheese: Nothing special for what it claims to be; there was no smokey flavour in the cheese and was very salty.

245,Good BBQ,Causeway Bay,Chinese,2.8,66.0,0.0,"Hysan Place's food court area has a new opening. Good BBQ, serving Hong Kong roasted food items like char siu and roast portk. The stuff you can find any where in Hong Kong. But their difference is they use a slow cook method instead of the traditional way of roasting it with an open torch. I've seen it around and heard it was pretty good. But their other branches weren't near me and I generally don't like to travel far for char siu (even though I love it tons!). Now that it's opened in Causeway Bay, I decided to give it a try.The menu is in English and Chinese. They seem to have a lot of choices and combos. But what peaked my interest was the sizzling hot plate option. You can order rice box and add $13 for a sizzling hot plate that will also have a Japanese egg. With Pepper Lunch just next door, I was intrigued.0This is what I ordered. A slow cooked char siu with soy chicken ($53) on a sizzling hot plate ($13). Well, it sizzled but it wasn't as fragrant as the people eating Pepper Lunch around me. There was a generous amount of rice and the egg was softly poached so it was great mixing it up with the rice.The sauce included didn't have much flavor. Same with the onions that were included. A bit on the bland side and usually I find that very salty in other place.0The soy sauce chicken was ok. Though not a lot of meat could be found. It was mostly bones. At least the meat was moist.0The char siu was a bit on the sweet side. However, it had a good meat to fat ratio. How did the slow cooked method taste compared to the regular way? Not much difference.0The sizzling hot plate option was fun but Pepper Lunch does a better job. The roast meat was ok but not mind blowing. For the price, there are definitely cheaper options out there. For taste, there are definitely better options out there. But as it's a food court, it was ok. But then there are also better options in this food court. I really won't be back.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-good-bbq/568097?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

They do deliveries for orders above 150 from 11am-2pm. I menu I have uploaded (from their facebook page) differs slightly to the ony they had in teh store - the Blanched vegetables was omitted and the other sides were marked up to $15. However, they have promotion on the side (mentioned below).I went for the lean char Sui with some sides. I originally only wanted the spinach but the lady at the counter told me that they are currently running a promotion for $15 for 2 sides so I choose roasted eggplants chili miso. I didn't check my order as I wanted to get out of the rain but when I opened the boxes, I realized they gave me broccoli instead of the eggplants. Nothing wrong with the broccoli, I just would have preferred my order of eggplants. I thouroughlu enjoyed my spinach and the char sui was as expected. I would have liked more sui mei sauce.0The box that the food comes in is quite adorable.

Plus there are varieties like the spinach that you might not get in the traditional shops. The sides were smaller than I expected but I guess for $8, its not bad. It would have been pretty great if they also offered a variety of rice (e.g. brown rice). I would probably return again should I have sui mei cravings and try that eggplant that I missed out on today.Supplementary InformationProbably a good idea to add a side of vegetables as the sui mei box itself only contains rice and the meat chosen."", ""My colleague hyped about the slow-cooked Chinese BBQ pork of this shop so I came to check it out. The shop branded itself as a not-your-average Chinese BBQ restaurant by:1) its tiffany-blue color theme, almost like a froyo shop;2) its use of uncoventional method of slow-cooking its BBQ pork (supposedly more tender and juicy than the traditional kind); and 3) offering a few trendy/creative side dishes which would never set foot in a traditional Chinese BBQ place, such as hot spring egg (with wobbly egg white and egg yolk), eggplant with fish sauce, homemade kimchi and fried okra.I ordered slow-cooked BBQ pork and chicken with rice. The slow-cooked BBQ pork was on par with the good ones in Central, such as Lung Kee and Yat Lok. Its scallion oil had no taste to it whatsoever. While the food was decent, I would not revisit the shop for the following its pitiful portions and un-generosity:1) Pitiful portions: While the side dishes looked good, Good BBQ asked for HK$15 for two bite-sized side dishes. Literally, two bites - think of the wasabi or small kimchi plastic containers when you order takeouts. While the prices were considered reasonable in Central, a grown man would not be satisfied with the quantity the shop offered; and2) All the surcharges: Extra scallion oil in a half-full 5ml costs an extra HK$1 (just like McDonald if you want an extra dip for six-piece McNugget). An extra HK$2 just to pick a fattier or leaner portion of BBQ pork. While some shops, e.g. Lung Kee, do charge extra for scallion oil if the order doesn't contain chicken, the BBQ pork surcharge is simply unheard of. This place seems to seize every opportunity to charge extra the way its peer shops won't. In conclusion, food was on par with other good BBQ restaurants in Central. The portion's reasonable for office ladies but not the lads. Side dishes, as tempting as they look, came in abhorrent portions for what you pay for. I didn't feel good looking at all the possible surcharges. It certainly didn't make me want to go back again.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-good-bbq/472287?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

He suggested this road side Thai restaurant, so we can smoke during our lunch. Very close by to Lan Kwai Fong, but not easy to located tho.Ordered Six Pieces of Chicken and Beef Satay with peanut dipping sauce, the satay is grilled perfectly and the dipping sauce is extremely good. I think the dipping sauce are restaurant self made, can actually taste the strong peanut flavour. Pad Tai, fried Thai noodles with dried shrimp, love the lite sour taste, portion size is enough for both of us to share. Also ordered a Thai style Ice Tea, its a bit sweet compare to the normal Hong Kong style but the taste of tea is actuallu lot stronger.Overall the food quality is impressive, location is very convenience, 5 min walk from Central MTR station. Love the outdoor dinning area and would def to come again in the weekend for dinner."", ""It's the worst curry I have ever had in Hong Kong. I ordered a bowl of chicken red curry with a bowl of white rice. The dish looks okay. Unfortunately, the curry taste too creamy, too sweet and oil. It is not spicy at all. As the taste is too unpreasent, I cannot even finish it after eating half of it. Given the price of $80 per curry dish (+ $15 for a bowl of rice), I would say it is simply a rape.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-good-luck-thai-food-restaurant/10002?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
248,GoodDay Cafe,Causeway Bay,Chinese,3.2,126.7,0.0,"We picked out Goodday cafe from the app for its 1:1 meal promotion. On this basis we trekked across town to look for it. However, once seated we enquired about the menu options and were told that the restaurant *requires* you to make an advance booking or will not honor the promotion. It was mid afternoon and only 1 table out of 6 was occupied. Perhaps i should have dug in to the fine print, but this was the first time i have heard this amongst about 20 restaurants we have been to with the app.Anyway the manager instead conceded to allow us 1:1 coffees...which frankly seems worse as an outright bait-and-switch. If you are a restaurant owner and going to run a promotion you want the result to be a customer that comes again, not a customer that vows not to come again. A failed promotion leaves them worse off then when they started.Anyway we stayed for lunch, having made the trip. The menu is simple cafe selection; burgers, pastas, eggs & western breakfasts. The burgers are offered with peanut butter topping; nobody at our table felt like exploring this one. The cheeseburger was adequate burger+bun+lettuce+tomatoes, served with chunky fries (though the order was for the salad not the fries) on a piece of slate. OK, but a bit short of expectations for HK$90.Things to note:-if you want to wash your hands, the bathrooms are outside the restaurant, down the street, across 2 separate traffic lights, in a public building. It took 10 minutes get there and back.-No credit cards. Cash only. of course.', ""Another weekend wondering for food and we came across this restaurant. Quite a cozy restaurant with limited number of seats.Soft shell crab with mango salsa burgerSoft shell crab burger$ 880Soft shell crab burger$ 88Interesting combo with soft shell crab and mango, but actually i quite like this match. Mango wasn't sour and the background sweetness does pair with the seafood sweetness. In general, crab is slightly small but is crispy, with the crunchy lettuce, this make a good standard soft shell burger. Fries were also freshly made, you can taste the hot, crisp outter layer with good soft inner center, good pairing with the burger. I did order an italian white house wine just to pair with this burger.Chorizo SpaghettiChorizo spaghetti $ 780Chorizo spaghetti $ 78This Chorizo spaghetti is surprisingly good! The tomato based sauce matched with the spice from the chorizo. Topped cheese, home-made by the chef, is crisp and does have a good hint of spice linking with the spaghetti.

White tables.Menu is in English and Chinese. Like I stated before, very classic cafe style food.000I decided to order an all day breakfast. They had so many to choose from. So, I decided why not? The Goodday English Breakfast.Goodday English Breakfast ($98). This included two slices of toasted baguettes, scrambled egg, bacon, sausage, sauteed mushrooms, cherry tomato salad, baked beans and a hash brown. Quite a lot of food. I found it odd that the small slab of butter was placed on one slice of bread. I guess that small bit of butter was to be shared. I did discover that one slice of bread was also warm so the butter melted evenly while the one on the bottom was cold and thus made it hard to spread the butter. Hash brown and sausage was pretty good. The bacon was not crispy but that is pretty much what I find all over Hong Kong and I've grown to just ignore this and just say .. yeah, the Hong Kong people here like soggy bacon. The scrambled eggs were a bit too watery. The salad was evenly dressed and I liked that a lot. I can't say much about baked beans from a can so I won't.0It was over all ok. Filling but yeah ... ok.Latte ($40). This was one said cup of coffee. The latte art wasn't very good as there wasn't enough foam to prop it up. But I'm not picky about latte art if the coffee is excellent. Unfortunately, the coffee was not good at all. Weak and watery, it bordered on bitter.0A sweet cafe where I hoped had potential but unfortunately, it was just like a lot of other cafes that serve all day breakfasts. It's ok. Not great.

Still salty, but this time, I could taste the flavors meshing together - the bacon and the rocket worked together amazingly with the bbq sauce.  I never thought rocket would do so well in a burger.

252,Grappa's Ristorante,Admiralty,Italian,3.7,188.8,0.0,"It has been quite a while since I last had my lunch with C. Though we share the same account but due to different schedules, it is not very often that we dine together. Therefore, it is always pleasurable for us to try out different restaurants together: one being a photographer and the other being the writer....We decided to pay a visit to Grappa's for lunch after our drawing lesson. C tried out the restaurant with her friend before and she highly recommended the pasta at Grappa's. Since we both were pasta lovers, so why not? Situated at the Pacific Place, you could imagine that Grappa's being nothing less than a middle-high class restaurant. All I hoped was that the food worth the money. As we walked into the restaurant, to my surprise, it was quite a traditional atmosphere. With westerners being part of the majority of customers and the busy kitchen operating at the peak of a Saturday's lunch hour, everything seemed so perfectly like a decent restaurant to me. The waiters were extremly helpful and nice - with a smile on their faces being a bonus, of course.0It took us a while to decide our orders. Grappa's had a wide selection of pasta dishes as well as other forms of appetizers, pizzas and desserts. Since we did not want to fill ourselves excessively, we each ordered a plate of pasta along with a drink to go light for lunch. Bread - with olive oil and vinegar sauce 0Bread - with olive oil and vinegar sauce Likewise any other Italian restaurants, there were some bread before the dishes arrived to drag us away from starvation. To be honest, both of us did not like the bread. It was not warm enough and the crust was hardened. Consequently the texture wasn't soft enough to blend in with the vinegar and olive oil, not to mention about its chewiness. Though I quite liked the bread cutted in a long, slim shaped to keep the customers handy in eating, but perhaps cutting in a thicker form would be better?Linguine Nere0Linguine NereAfter a while of waiting, our pasta dishes arrived. C ordered Linguine Nere, mainly because of her favourite sauce being squid ink. She was extremly excited after she had her first bite. She praised the freshness of the prawns as well as the well cooked linguine. Everything was just as she expected from a high-end Italian restaurant. Though she thought that the only ingredient being the prawn was a bit too dull and the sauce along with the thickness of linguine had made her bloated after the meal.Spaghetti Marinara0Spaghetti MarinaraAs for my pasta dish, Spaghetti Marinara, was quite nice. It did not contain any fancy ingredients, but the Marinara sauce made all the magical things happened. It smelled extremly tempting when I mixed the spaghetti with the sauce. Again, the spaghetti was well cooked, together with the herbs and olive oil that flavoured the dish. Though one thing that I was not satisfied about this dish was its portion being slightly small, I was just enough when I finished. The presentation of the dish wasn't anything too unforgettable, nor was the ingredients being anything memorable and impressive. I would say that the Marinara sauce was the only enhancement for this dish. Iced chocolate and Iced Mocha0Iced chocolate and Iced MochaThere was no excuses not to enjoy a cup of icy drink at this time of the weather, as well as the creaminess of the pasta. C ordered a cup of Iced Chocolate and I had a cup of Iced Mocha. From their appearances, they did not look any attractive to me. In fact, they looked like the self-catered drinks you got from buffett. Unsurprisingly, they tasted just like them. Watery and the least kind of flavour you would imagine to get from Iced Chocolate/Mocha. It was hard for me to recall myself being at an Italian restaurant as I was sipping the drinks in quite an unwilling manner. I definitely did not think this cup of drink cost me HKD45 solely. If you are looking for a place to get some good pasta, I would say Grappa's quite a decent one. Yet if you are looking for something more original and special in its own cooking of Italian food, I wouldn't recommend you coming to Grappa's. Simply because of its location being at Pacific Place had increased the prices of the food than necessary. To me, I much prefer places like Al Dente and other traditional Italian restaurants in Soho, Central.- Y"", ""Many of the restaurants in Pacific come and go, especially the Western ones. The location where Zelo is now used to be La Fourchette, Cafe de Paris and whatever else. Grappa's however has been there as long as I remember. It's not an exciting restaurant but it delivers a consistency that you look for if you are meeting someone for lunch on a work day. That is why it is always full on the weekdays and if you try to book on the day, you wouldn't get a table. My friend booked over a week in advance and so she asked for one of the booths that sits four people. There were 3 of us and we each chose a 4 course executive lunch set. 2 of us chose roast vegetables to start and pasta with prawns for main course. One friend chose Caesar's salad and roast chicken.My roast vegetables salad was better than expected. It had roasted vegetables like courgette and aubergines and there was a balsamic vinegar like dressing, healthy and tasty. My friend's Caesar's was small and dry, I guess shouldn't go to an Italian restaurant for Caesar's salad, she learnt. The portions were smaller than I remembered and I guess I haven't been to Grappa's for a year, they may have found out that most people cannot finish a 4 course meal for lunch if the portions are big.As for main course, our prawn spaghetti in spicy olive oil dressing was also much smaller, a manageable size. The prawns were plump and juicy, even for someone not always too keen on prawns, have to say they were well cooked and fresh. The spaghetti was al dente but not as hard as those of Cova which some Hong Kongers find too hard no matter how authentic that may be. So I really enjoyed my pasta.Spaghetti with prawns0Spaghetti with prawnsThe friend who ordered Roast chicken said it was spectacularly good and if she came again, she will order it again. I have to say they now present the dishes very nicely too, nicer than before where it was more rustic without any fuss. On top of the chicken were roasted crispy sweet potatoes, a very nice idea and complementary taste. Roast Chicken0Roast ChickenDessert was a choice of Panna Cotta and what they described as bread cake. I know bread and butter pudding British style but not bread cake. I watched my friend's cake arrive first before I decided on the safe choice of Panna Cotta knowing their Panna Cotta is very good. The bread cake looked wrong. Bit like bread and butter pudding with apple crumble topping in a pie crust. My friend was disappointed too as she thought it was bread and butter pudding. Panna cotta was rich, creamy and not overly sweet. Excellent but a bit much for the ending to lunch, so I had half. I always enjoy the coffee at Grappa's and so when I remember to book in advance, I will come again some day."", 'Came here for lunch with a few buddies.  Not much choice for set lunch menu - 3 for appe, 4 for mains and panna cotta or creme brulee for dessert.  Both the appetizer and the main (I picked stuffed chicken breast) were quite decent.  The portion was quite big, too!  The chicken breast was a little on the salty side and it was such a big piece I could not even finish.  The dessert was really good.

I was curios to try as well. Be honest we order all Carta since setlunch was totally different than other restaurant and we didn't like that. We order Fettuccine Black ink, Steakspecial from the chef and carbonara. The food was ok, Pasta was bit overcooked and steak also overcooked as well  ( we ask medium rare they delivery medium well ), be honest nothing special but we can accept ( other branch sure is better ).What make us really upset, was the unprofessional way how the staff take care of us. Service was horrible andtotally unacceptable. We asked to talk with manager, and finally after waiting for more than 10 minutes the ladycome to us, she told us to be the manager in charge and, instead to apologies, she try to explain to us why thathappen ( waiting 15 minutes for bottle of water??? ).How can this kind of restaurant got the unprofessional manager like that, its unbelievable!!!The feeling was nobody follow the rules and waiter was impolite and unprofessional.

254,Great Asia Japanese Restaurant,Wan Chai,Japanese,3.4,160.7,0.0,"Ordered the sashimi set ($150) and it was quite good.  As shown in the photo below and as mentioned by other food lovers, the sashimi was fresh and with enough thickness.  My favorites were the salmon, yellow tail, and scallops as they all had good texture and flavor.  The white fish was a bit bland, which is unfortunately the way its taste is.0Service was decent, and tables were set apart enough that one wouldn't be drown out by noises or talks.  Wasn't that busy even during lunch hour, so it's a good getaway from the busy buzzing street and restaurants.PS  20% off is still being offered."", ""When we last went to Great Asia next to PP3, they told us they were going to move but had not found a new address. 2 months ago, while stopping at the traffic lights outside the old Wanchai market, I saw the Great Asia sign up across the road and told my friends who used to go to Great Asia with me where it had moved and we decided to try it today.The location is hard to find. For one, it is no longer on the G/F, and there wasn't a clear sign outside the building as it is a residential block. When we got to the entrance, a caretaker who sat outside the building asked if we were there to eat and let us in. Once inside, it is once again a really big space divided into 2, so 2 units of the residential block. There were quite a lot of people there.The menu was just 2 typed sheets in clear folders, not like the old menus with photos and there was no English version. My 2 friends do not read Chinese, so I had to translate. We ordered the cod fish set (me), fried beef set and the tempura udon set. The food arrived after a short while and the portions were much smaller than before. They let me have a California hand roll instead of the sashimi starter as I don't eat raw fish (the microbiology unit at University killed it for me). My friend who does eat sashimi asked them to exchange a piece to another type and they obliged, I thought very nice of them. My cod fish was nice but then again, it can never go wrong, grilling a piece of black cod with mirin. The steamed egg was not special and I am not sure what the rice was meant to be but it was coloured with some tiny bits in it. It didn't taste much of anything. The miso soup could have been hotter. I didn't taste any of my friends' foods but thought the sashimi looked fresh, the beef looked like a Chinese dish and the tempura batter looked a bit thick and stoggy. The set came with either coffee or ice cream. I remember they served Japanese coffee with evaporated milk and so went for green tea ice cream. We all agreed the food was so so. I guess it always had been but since we work near Pacific Place, it used to be walking distance, easy to book and those were the main reasons we went. We probably won't go back again.0000000000"", 'Have not been here for ages. After checking out the wannabe posh buffet lunch at Mes Amis, and investigated the rather enigmatic Pomme on Luard Road (it\'s a French pastry place I finally discovered), my lunch companion and I decided to come here. After all, the raw fish is supposed to be good as they apparently do a lot of wholesale as well.It was a crowded place, so we sat at the bar. Their lunch deals are the usual ranges in terms of variety and pricing. The strategicially placed $200 lunch set at the start of the menu that consists of a ""half slab"" uni and chopped fatty tuna and spring onion with rice was quite inviting. I was famished and decided to go for something that would be easy to scoff down lol, and fell for the fatty tuna rice set. Although it might not have been conducive to sustainable fishing (however I was sure my tuna would be no blue fin variety), and the protein content was quite low, and even though I am no great fan of uni, I still went for this. In hindsight I think I wasn\'t too turned on by the other choices on the menu, except for perhaps what I call mixed cubic sashimi leftover rice set lol.The lunch set consisted of the following, in chronological order:(1) Mini crab roe salad  - this was a small bowl of salad with mostly julienned cucumber, a few shreds of leaves, a dollop of mayo with a sprinkling of crab roe on top. The ingredients were fresh enough.(2) Half slab uni - this came in a small round Chinese sauce dish on a bed of julienned cucumber. The uni was fresh but the taste was so-so. I am prejudiced here, because I think the ""best"" uni I\'ve had was the time when my dad brought back a bucket full of these black balls with protruding needles, and gave me, a 5-year-old child, a bit of the stuff to taste. I was pretty grossed out by the pulsating insides and ran away after the first sampling lol. Hence I have no penchant for uni. Proust was so right about how childhood memories can affect your taste for food, and I can tell you endless heart-warming stories of hairy crab on chilly evenings with my mom\'s crew that provide the fodder for my passion for the crustacean.(3) Fatty tuna and spring onion with rice- what I liked most about this is that the rice was ever so slightly warm. As I suspected would be the case, the tuna didn\'t have much taste to speak of. It suited me fine, because the ""mash"" and the rice was neatly aligned so that I could just pick off a good mouthful and load it into my mouth after my chopsticks have briefly run into the wasabi. Very clinical, but functional nonetheless.(4) miso soup  - this was the common miso soup that was hot enough. (5) coffee  - this was served in a dainty cup and they served evaporated milk with it. Very Hongky-nised which is quite cute in a way. The coffee was a no-brainer crowd-pleasing blend.My lunch companion is a salmon sashimi lover and exchanged his uni slab for salmon sashimi for the same price. You would have hoped that they would be more generous with the salmon, but it was disappointing to see only 3 pieces on the plate. It\'s off-putting that restaurant-owners do not think about these things and just leverage on your food preference to make a bit more profit. Off-putting in this supposedly extremely difficult business environment. You know enough about the restaurant\'s take on customer relations.While the quality of the food did not provide any delight, it was the meticulous presentation that saved the day. Still, the measuredness of the portions and the absence of any sweeteners when all things were considered is the main disincentive for me to pay this place a visit again.'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/wan-chai-great-asia-japanese-restaurant/48207?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

Having seen so many positive comments about the potato skillet while it was offered in lunch set, I gave it a try. The portion was too big for a female, especially it's with lots of sausages, bacon and cheese. The potatos were very delicious. When you eat with tomato sauce, it taste like french fries but definitely much more crispy and fresh. The whole dish was quite greasy with all the fattening ingredients and I found it difficult to finish the whole plate even I added in quite a lot of ketchup to make it less greasy. It would be a great choice for people to share when everyone has a few bites of it though.

The couple both ordered waffel. My friend and I ordered the potato. We also ordered mac & cheese pasta to share. However is the most expensive but it's very terrible, the pasta is watery. The restaurant didn't order lunch set on Sat. If they can order set include a small portion of waffel and drink, I would recommend friends coming back. A la cart order can allow me feel value for money and I can't order two full sets, it's too much after finishing one full portion of potato. The restaurant is too small and it's not a nice place for a leisure weekend brunch with friends to chat.0000"", ""Waking up with a hangover on Saturday morning is never great but thankfully Green Waffle Diner is right next door. Me and the girl decided to hop in for a quick brunch around 1230pm. The Diner was packed (always a good sign on the weekends) and we had to wait for 15 minutes or so to get a table. We were served ice/cold water while we were waiting - a sign of good service and consideration for the customers, so automatic +1The menu itself is very extensive, consisting of the standard brunch fare of egg+meat+carb (waffles, pancakes and omeletts) and also some other lunch-y items (fried chicken and fish and chips). We decided to get the skillets - a mixture of poached eggs, fried potato and some variation of meat (sausage, steak, bacon) and quite a generous portion of cheese, all grilled together and presented in a hot skillet1. Egg, steak and has skillet (around HKD95)Steak, egg and has skillet$ 950Steak, egg and has skillet$ 952. Country skillet (bacon, peppers and onion) (around HKD90)Country skillet$ 900Country skillet$ 90I went with the Eggs with Steak skillet (around HKD100) and the girl opted for the eggs and bacon one (around HKD95). We also got a side of orange juice and iced tea to rehydrate our hungover bodiesFood (Overall 8/10)Cant really go wrong when you put so many good things in one pan, sprinkle it with cheese and grill/saute it. But the skillet was so much more, the steak was beautifully cooked to the point it melted in the mouth, the onions in the skillet were grilled and provided a tangy/sweet relief from the carb overdose. The eggs itself were nicely cooked with the beautifully oozing yolks - I swear the number of times I have been disappointed with overdone poached eggs at reputable places is very high, thankfully this was not one of those places. The skillet was sprinkled with some paprika. On mixing, the yolk and the melted cheese combined nicely with the potatoes to create the perfect hangover cure. I'd rate this a 8/10Service (9/10)The servers were very courteous and did not need to be told to refill our water glasses. The timing of the food itself was also good, and it took only about 10-15 minutes for the skillets to arrive. Nothing to fault here so a 9/10Value/$ (9/10) Initially we were planning on having a waffle after the skillets (yes, we like to eat) but the skillets made us so full that we decided to drop the thought. I personally think it was good value for money given that a HKD100 dish made me very full, while at the same time having some nice ingredients and great taste. The overall bill came to just under 300 for 2 people. In my book this is a 9/10Needless to say I will be back, maybe to try out the waffles next time"", ""There's been a waffle fever in HK lately. fantastic presentation, with exotic flavors you can't even imagine. but what's to me, simple, healthy, and delicious is the key. that's why whenever I have waffle craving, I always go to Green Waffle  I love Green Waffle not only coz of their yummy waffles, but also their warm and attentive service and their aromatic Americano.Today with no exception, I ordered my all time favorite - Katherine's breakfast with pandan waffle. fresh fruit bowl topped with granola, yogurt and honey. sweet, light, and healthy! another one of my favorites that I didn't order this time but would recommend is their fresh kiwi juice. they freshly made in store with real fruit pulp, my alternative to coffee  Katherine breakfast with Americano0Katherine breakfast with Americano"", ""I decided to give this place a try after my friend highly recommended it.here are two things u need to know about this restaurant:1. very popular, limited number of tables, u must make a reservation2. two timeslots available for lunch: 12, or 1:30 pm  if time allow, take the 12 one as you will be the first batch to take lunch set! if u take the 1:30 pm, u probably have to wait til 1:45 for the diners from 12 o'clock batch to leave.3. sit back and enjoyso I went there at 12 and there was hardly anybody, besides one table for the walk-ins, the others were reserved.the lunch set cost varied from 50-80 dollarsdepending on what you order.the set includes a main dish, drink, and half a waffle for dessert. There were 4-5 options of main dishes to choose from. My friend ordered cheesy chicken fillet , I had the tenderloin steak sandwich with fries.At first I was worried about the portion of the main dishes, as this restaurant seemed more of a cafe for waffles. However the portion was surprisingly LARGE.I am a huge eater (trust me. when I eat, I eat like a man) but the portion was large for me! my friend's chicken fillet was served in a hot sizzling pat with cheese melting on tiny potato cubes and chicken fillets. The scent of chicken was overwhelmingly goooood. I kinda regretted ordering the steak sandwich when it arrived becoz it looked boring in comparison to my friend's sizzling symphony. HOWEVER, I was wronggg! the steak wasn't boring at all!!! it was beautifully seasoned, juicy, with some mushroom, it was a lil salty for me>< but overall it was very good for a cafe standard. the bread was baguette, buttered, fresh out from the toaster.Starting at 1:10 the staff urged us twice to order drinks and dessert as the second batch of lunch diners coming in. having waffle as dessert really made my day! The portion was half a waffle size but i thought it was a decent size as I got so full after savoring the main dish. the waffle was freshly made with a bbt of cream and Nutella sauce on top. It was crunchy on the outside and soft inside. u could taste the freshness of it. No cardboard taste at all like some other waffles. A little disappointment was that the choice of waffle for set lunch was fixed, so I couldn't try out the pandan waffle.. YES! they offer pandan flavored waffles!!!!!!!!! I am planning to go again this week for lunch and be a lil more ambitious to order an pandan waffle ! he Heeee."", ""Came for lunch. Found the food amateurish, dissapointing and uninteresting. Don't believe the lunch set is good value for money. Fish & Chips were flavourless. No seasoning on on the fish or chips.Bruschetta - really basic and the bread tasted like the baguettes you buy in any Chinese bakery (not agood).Meat skillet - the poached egg on top was small and gross as it wasn't poached through. The white was stilla bit liquid.Crap quality meat and sausages. Very greasy. Actually felt nauseous afterwards.Waffles were dry and arrived cold (not sure if that's how they do them normally.)

As I did not book a table, the waitress kindly told my friend and I to return the table at 115pm. The place looked very relaxing and chill, shame that the aircon above me was slightly too strong. Their lunch menu had 5 options, but for the greedy me, I wish they had some breakfast options in it too! Anyways, it includes a coffee or tea and half a waffle - very cute and just the right proportion before I stuff myself with too much waffle.

The hollandaise sauce was tasteless!!! Hows that possible? Usually I find eggs benedict too rich in taste but I had to put in loads of salt and pepper to make this tolerable. The poached eggs - white part rather too firm; yolk was alright; sides was greatly disappointing, a plateful of tiny potato bits only. A little of them would be fine in the skillet, but alone they are too dry and tasteless, and rather difficult to fork together. Would recommend them to give us more side choices, and leave the tiny potatoes, not good. - Hot chocolate - AWFUL. I tried both the regular one and the macadamian nut one, both way to sweet to drink more than 2 sips. It's not chocolatey, it's just SWEET. A bit overpriced as drinks were not included in the breakfast set.Well, I'd still recommend this place for the good dishes, and all in all I can tell the owner really puts his/her heart into it.

And only 2 people serving and preparing drinks. While we waiting for our drinks, I saw a fly flying all over the place, it even stays on the drinks just prepared by the woman in charge, I was so shocked and i just can;t imagine if that drink is for me. After 15-20 mins, my drink finally arrived, but my friend still waiting for the iced latte. The smoothie turned out to be lots of ice with a tiny bit of blueberry and apple juice, i never tasted such a thing and its called smoothie, i can never imagine that. I cancelled the drink as it was totally a scam. The woman in charge kept telling me that she hasn't added any sugar while the shops out there, they all have sugars, blah blah blahI just wanted to say its not about the sweetness or whatever, and I have had smoothies for so long and so many times, i have never tasted such thing and it could be called smoothie, it was the taste itself, its just like drinking iced water and nothing much more than that. It was really a mistake. I saw how she made the drinks, she put so much ice and a little bit of juices or whatever, i could see how stingy she is..probably she is the owner.After a while, the iced latte also arrived, it tasted OK, as usual, so my friend was OK with thatThen waited for another 20 mins or so, the woman in charge came over and told us that they ran out of rhubarb, and asked us to pick another dish for free, come on, why would you take our order when you ran out of stuff, and after we waited for like 40 mins, they came and said they don't have that, i just can't imagine that, it never happened to me. Anyway, we decided to order the same thing, and she promised to serve in few minutes, so we jsut waited.Finally, the food arrived, i could say the waffles tasted nothing special, as it's just the waffles that you could have in any other waffles place, they are all crunchy on the outside and soft in the inside, it's pretty standard. And i ordered the green one, but it doesn't got the pandan taste at all. And the waffles weren't hot either when they came to the table.

Now E loves breakfast foods so when I suggested Green Waffle and its concept, she was damn excited. Reservations were never needed for my previous visits here during dinner, but I made reservations in case. When I arrived the small-ish diner was three-quarters full on a Thursday lunch... a good sign? Here they have a very reasonably-priced lunch set menu which includes a main and a dessert (half a waffle with a scoop of ice cream). But since nothing on the set lunch menu enticed us (green apple compote with waffle and sausage?!) we opted for their simpler items on the menu. We decided on a breakfast of seared vine tomatoes with scrambled eggs and a whole-wheat waffle (instead of the normal toast) ($44 + 9 for the upgrade), and a buckwheat waffle with blueberries and cinnamon sugar.The scrambled eggs here were quite good - creamy and slightly runny lovely! The seared vine tomatoes (my favourite kind) were really sweet and juicy albeit slightly undercooked for my liking. A little more time on the grill or pan would have made it better and less hard in texture. The whole wheat waffle upgrade was Es idea. Not a bad one either. There was a strong presence of that wheat taste, similar to 100% whole wheat bread, but the texture was maintained at a light and airy form  delicious with a little maple syrup complimentary from Green Waffle.The next plate of buckwheat waffles with blueberries was sprinkled with the right amount of cinnamon sugar to give it the divine aroma that the cinnamon-addict in me lusts after. In hindsight I probably should have ordered something that was pre-set rather than create-your-own since this relatively simple and small plate ended up costing $51 (not that it is expensive for Soho, but compared to the previous huge plate of food!). Anyway, the buckwheat waffle itself, I would think, is closer in taste to the original plain ones, but didnt have that airy texture here =((. Blueberries were fresh but more couldve been provided as it looked quite dull on the plateA good lunch anyhow, and will definitely return for more breakfast items or whenever a waffle craving kicks in!00"", 'Glad to find a place in HK serving gluten-free waffles! They only state the buckwheat waffle is gluten free. I had the benedict on buckwheat waffles and the waitress confirmed the holladise sauce has no gluten. I hope they would also note on their menu which of the toppings are gluten free. The potatoes on the side are very yummy even without ketchup  =)My friend had chocolate chip waffle, which is yummy crispy and fluffy. The over easy egg is nicely cooked too.', ""So today I had a lazy Sunday brunch with one of my buddies. We suggested Green Waffle Diner since I have yet to try their fried chicken. Wow...the place was packed today for brunch. Last time I came here the place was pretty empty but after a slew of good reviews and articles in newspapers/magazines it seems like this neighborhood place has blown up in terms of popularity. My suggestion is if you want to come Sunday during brunch time...make a reservation.Environment: The place is definitely on the cozy side but I didn't feel cramped even with the place packed. After a 15 minute wait the 2 of us got a 4 person table so we had lots of room. I just love brightly lighted places (good for food photography!) and Green Waffle Diner satisfies that. Service: With this sudden increase in popularity it looks like the servers were significantly more busy. Food came out at a decent pace but I definitely could feel that they were strained in terms of staff. Talked with the owner for a while and he said his kitchen wasn't prepared to handle this many people so they're just trying their best to keep up. Overall service is still very friendly but I can imagine on busy days that the chances of them forgetting orders/making mistakes will increase. Food: I specifically came back today to try their signature fried chicken that my friends were raving about.  Country Fried Skillet - Quite a hearty dish and I liked how my buddy broke open the egg yolk to mix in with the potatoes giving them a more 'creamy' texture. Maybe a little heavy handed for me in terms of salt (I eat quite clean so a lot of people may not agree with me). My personal opinion is if the potatoes were more crunchy the contrast texturally might be better. No major wow factor but this was an enjoyable dish. Plain Waffle With Maple Syrup - Like last time I agree this is a solid waffle. Although they offer many waffles combinations with fruits or ice cream I personally prefer it just plain with a bit of maple syrup. It's not easy to produce a waffle that is crispy on the outside while somewhat soft in the inside and in this regard I think Green Waffle has done a good job. Also nice that you can taste that hint of 'egginess'. My only gripe is with the increase in customers they should try harder to serve the waffles hot to piping hot. It's still a good waffle when warm but I think it would be better if it was hotter.  Fried Chicken Meal - Now onto the star of the meal! When it first came out I was pretty shocked since the drumsticks were huge for HK standards. First bite into them was very nice. The exterior was crispy (they use a corn flake batter) with a bit of heat/kick (I'm told there is mustard) while the drumstick itself was really moist. Bit of a mess to eat since the crust was falling all over the table but considering I was using my hands to wolf down a giant drumstick...I didn't care...haha! Yum! The secret behind the chicken? I heard through the grapevine that they actually use a double preparation method for their chicken. After brining the drumsticks the night before they sous vide (means they cook it in a vacuum bag in constant low temperature water) first to make sure the chicken is properly cooked and juicy. After that they dip it in the batter and flash fry it to achieve that crispy exterior. This is probably a different approach relative to fried chicken places in the US but the bottom line is...it works. As to where they get local drumsticks so big...I'm told it is top secret...haha. Is it the best fried chicken in HK? I'm not sure I can say that but the fried chicken here is definitely tasty. Overall a very satisfying and reasonably priced brunch. I will definitely be returning for their fried chicken when I get that fried chicken itch. Hopefully with it's recent rise in popularity Green Waffle Diner won't take a dip in terms of quality and service.

259,Greyhound Caf,Central,Thai,3.1,201.2,6.0,"This was one of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had. My brother and I waited almost half an hour to even order - and once we did one thing we wanted wasnt available so we had to wait another 15 minutes to finish our order. Awful service, and the waiter showed absolutely no pleasure in serving us. Once our food came, it was inedible, we ordered a grilled ham and cheese and the bread was overly thick, the cheese was rubbery and fake (like American cheese), and developed a skin overtime - so it was most definitely processed and made with a lot of additives. The ham was rubbery as well. The fries that came with the dish were mediocre at best and were a huge let down from the picture. We also ordered spring rolls and they were the fresh ones instead of the fried we had wanted. We sent them back and were left Hungry. Very disappointing and will never return here. Overpriced and deplorable service.', ""Today we went to IFC Greyhound for lunch. Its been over 2 months that I did not have dinner over there. Even though there's quite a queue to wait but its worthwhile to do so coz 1) food quality is very good! 2) price is high competitiveness if compared with other restaurants in IFC. I wondered if all chefs in Greyhound are from thailand as their skills of using spicy is very professional.We ordered salmon salad with spicy sauce and cabbage, herbs aside, crab meat chili spaghetti (this is from new menu, glad that they offer new menu ttoday otherwise I must order chili salt fish fried rice again!) My friend ordered complicated noodles which is very yummy as well! The crab meat spaghetti is really really impressive which the crab meat is even more than the noodles!Super Gorgeous and costed $148 only. I tried the shaky yogurt but found its too milky and passed to my friend to kill it.The atmosphere is quite good although there's a queue outside but it won't bother you too much, still acceptable. The staffs there are very efficient but still in manner. I still remembered that I forgot an umbrella last time and the staff ran out and chased me for returning me back the umbrella.

It was worth it for me, but not for my colleagues. As we are all from the states, we were not use to waiting over 30 minutes for lunch. I'm sure with HK's fast pace environment; the locals are not use to it either.The service was nothing to praise about, you sit, you order, you eat you pay and then you leave... The waiters/waitresses will not go out of their way to ask you how your day is going or give you any recommendations. What's memorable was the softshell crab with ink spaghetti for me. It had the right amount of flavor so that it wasn't too flavorful or bland. I also had satay skewers, which were just normal skewers to me.What's memorable is the atmosphere. In the financial hub of HK, I'd expect a bunch of white collar workers, but that was not the case at Greyhound. It was filled with tourists."", ""Whenever I don't know what to eat in Central, Greyhound is always my go to place. The decor is nice and comfortable, service is great and the food is good. I usually get the Minced Chicken with Sweet Basil and Hot Chilies rice, but this time I tried the Fried Rice with Dried Salted Fish, Sweet Basil Leaves and Chilies Rice. I was expecting the fish to be slightly chewy, but it was completely crispy and I wasn't the biggest fan. I personally thought the rice overall was too plain, and it didn't have enough spices. My go to appetizer is always the Homemade Pate with Cognac and Fresh Green Peppercorns (Served with crispy toasts). It's basically Foie Gras spread and it's delicious. The pate is smooth and I love the unique taste paired with the peppercorns. It tasted like capers. If you go to Greyhound, you have to try their Iced Lemon Tea (Greyhound Style). The ice is flavoured and so when it melts, you get more iced tea (who doesn't want that right?!)The tea is refreshing and has a perfect balance of all things involved.0"", ""Have been to this place a few times all for business reasons. This place is close to the office building and offers quick meals. None of these previous visits turns out satisfactory. Every time I decided that I will never go back again for the poorly prepared food, but working in IFC doesn't leave you many choices for a spontaneous appointment. I ordered fried noodles with fresh shimp and chili for lunch today. The dish is very bland, and is extremely oily. My stomach felt so heavy after eating it. A big rip off for something like this.

Tom Yum Soup-- with only a few pieces of half mushroom and one shrimp.  Though the shrimp was rather big-size, it's not fresh and its texture felt like mash potato when we chewed it.

There's only approx. one rice-bowl-size amount of noodles.  Definitely can't feed a regular adult-size person.   Cant' understand why they give so little noodles as noodles are very cheap...  You have to count on ordering one more item if you want to feel fulfilling.3. Fried Chicken Wings (supposed to be the signature dish)-- looked, tasted, and felt (texture) like overnight leftovers and were reheated in the oven.  Pretty dry and hard.4. Thai Ice Tea-- okay.  Like any other Ice Tea from any Thai restaurant.Ambience was nice.Service was poor.

If people don't like too spicy version of Thai food, this will be ideal to suit your taste.

Fried rice is well flavored so you can easily finished the whole dish.0They also have hainan chicken rice, curry beef and green papaya salad set. Strongly recommended this restaurant as their lunch set really worth it! The only disadvantage is the restaurant is very small and you really need to squeeze in. No space between seat so it quite hard to enjoy the environment.', '000Have a meeting in Central today so I happened to stop by Grill during lunch, time for some grill goodness.

Dont forget to dip those into the awesome BBQ sauce!Fried Rice with Thais BBQ ($60)$ 600Fried Rice with Thais BBQ ($60)$ 60I also liked the rice a lot. I assumed they fried the rice with some of the sauces they have in house. It was a bit spicy but it wont kill your palette. It was quite savoury therefore a side of veggie was also served. I would highly recommend this rice for you if you like salty food like me!The lemon tea was actually not bad also. It was pre-sweetened. I have asked if they could reduce the sweeteness but they said they could onlly add more ice to do so. So I just leave it as it is. It was actually not very sweet with lots of fresh lemon taste. It was just a lot better I expected.Jumbo Prawn ($70)Jumbo Prawn ($70)$ 700Jumbo Prawn ($70)$ 70My first impression was, wow, indeed thats jumbo! It was almost as long as my palm!

Cold cut, roasted beef and pork, lasagna, pasta station, dessert bar and a table of different hot food. Moreover, you can also order different dishes from their menu (it's all you can eat). The food is really in high quality and good taste. The grissini (long bread) is hot and nice!! I like their vinegar and olive oil very much. It matches really well with the freshly baked grissini.

263,Gyotaku,Central,Japanese,3.8,211.7,0.0,"This place intrigued me as its quite hard to find authentic Japanese restaurants in Central. Since it was weekend lunch, seating wasnt a problem. Decor was very minimalist, and one of the chef was native Japanese. As brunch, we ordered the uni/minced tuna rice bowl, and another sashimi lunch set. With the dishes being raw ingredients based, we were able to taste its freshness. The sashimi set also served raw tuna and octopus, both being difficult ingredients to serve as tuna can easily have gamy flavor and raw octopus can easily turn foul. But the raw tuna tasted very light and fresh, with the raw octopus not having any slime and tasted light like squid. Even though for lunch it wasnt cheap, but definitely an alternative instead of heading towards Causeway Bay where its heavily Japanese cuisine based. 10', 'Stumbled upon this place for lunch on Saturday and it didnt disappoint! I was expecting small portions for the price as it was located in central but they gave sizeable portions. We ordered the hamachi rice bowl for $180 and the salmon tar tar, and scallop rice bowl which i added $10 dollars for the white truffle so totalling at $160. Both were sets that came with soup, salad and dessert. I would definitely come here again as it was a really quiet space to dine with comfortable seating. The only thing was the waitress kept pushing the next courses on us before we were finished, but i guess we came around 1:30am so we were nearing the end of their service. Would definitely recommend this place!', ""salad0saladchirashi0chirashiMy first time having lunch here, so decided on trying out the daily special chirashi bowl. The set comes with soup and salad but no dessert if you order the special of the day. My bowl of chirashi came out and all I see are small chopped up pieces of tuna & salmon sashimi with one piece of scallop then topped with couple salmon roe. There's also couple pieces of tomago(Japanese egg) that's mixed in. The fish was so sparse on top that I can see the rice on the bottom. I had to eat my sashimi sparingly in order for me to notrun out sashimi to go with my rice later. One thing I would say nicely about this place is the sashimi is still pretty fresh.

So I opted for the next best thing, a full breakfast for lunch. And off to Caffe Habitu I went.0The All Day Breakfast ($98) comes with two super sized toasts along with the usual suspects: sausages, bacon, baked bean, scrambled eggs, mushrooms and smoked salmon. I wasn't really looking for something spectacular and I thought simple thing like these shouldn't fail. Except that it kind of did. The scrambled eggs tasted only of cream. I know a lot of people would add milk or cream when making scrambled eggs but this one is way too heavy. It's almost like eating solidified cream.The highlight of the dish was the jam! It has a faint taste of rose and it goes well with the slightly sweet toast. The rest were normal.And did it cure my hangover?

267,HABIT table,Causeway Bay,Italian,4.3,150.0,,"two days ago i brought my mum to this restaurant to look at the menu, and her eyes instantly lighted up upon the sight of beautiful egg benes. when we thought of a place to go for lunch in causeway this afternoon, she suggested giving this a try.we first settled on a wooden table, but since we wanted more comfort on our back we requested to be moved to any available sofa seats...luckily our wish was granted within five minutes, before we ordered. The staff had been really helpful with this.We struggled between egg florentine and the tsar's choice, but eventually picked the latter for we had been seduced by smoked salmon. For this reason we decided to have something else lighter,instead of gorging in chunks of meat for lunch,and ordered a pizza margarita to share. I strongly recommended latte to my mum and she ordered an Earl grey latte, while I got a skimmed oolong latte for myself.We were not surprised when the coffees came first. The presentation was good ad the latte art was attractive,and I urged my mum to take a sip before she commented on the drink positively. I took a sip of hers and could feel the aroma and sweetness of Earl grey tea through the coffee and foam. Yumm. Mine was a little disappointing for I could hardly taste the oolong tea at all. For a moment I wondered if they had given me the correct drink. But still the milk foam was thick and smooth.The benes came next- the two weren't pipping hot for the eggs were poached. We shared and each got a muffin of eggs and stuff. The egg was just cooked with runny whites and a molten yolk which only expode when you poke the knife through. The sauce on top was not excessively thick and salty and that was goooood. The smoked salmon was not too salty but just alright, unlike those at frying pan. The muffin was thinner than those you get at mcdonalds,but tasted more wheatish and healthy. A pity that it had not been toasted to the extent that it was thoroughly crispy, and it got a little soggy after the yolk was poked and moisted the dish. I still remember the perfect bene served at Tiffin's during Sunday brunch; that was certainly the most perfect bene I have ever tried. This was not bad, and I think it can come second as it has well surpassed frying pan and whatever soho diners at preparing this simple yet challenging dish. One thing I gota point out that the spoonful of caviar was soo small that it's negligible-what's the point of including that to the dish,apart from pushing up the price by 30 dollars at max?The ultra thin pizza came last- I was stunned by the thinness of it,a page off my notebook would have been thicker than that! My mum who was hungry and finished the bene quicker than I did sliced one quarter off and said it was good. I only got to repeat what she did after ten mins for I ate slow. My punishment for that was to eat a slice of cold pizza, I thought, which must not be good in anyway. And I was wrong for it was more than being thin. I had expected the crust to be crunchy but it turned out to be more chewy and textured, there were at least three layers in the crust... It kinda tasted like thin foil pastry before it's baked. I was amazed. The simple tricolored toppings went very well together and the melted cheese was far stronger and richer than I had expected. The tomatoes were still fresh after baking and the chopped basil gave an attractive herby aroma to the pizza. This dish is highly recommended. My mum and I could finish the whole pizza quickly for it was too yummy to resist!After having a satisfying lunch we sat and took full advantage of the free wifi provided. I like the sofa we sat on- was it a product of G.O.D? I remember seeing it somewhere but hm....anyway,the lunch cost nearly 300 for the latte were 40ish each.

269,HAL'S,Causeway Bay,Japanese,2.2,140.0,0.0,"Came here for lunch as I walked by here a while back and it was still under construction at the time with a ""We\'re COMING BACK!"" Apparently, this is the same Hal\'s Japanese that was once in Central then moved to Tang Lung Street and now relocated here. I had heard good things about the food in past years so was wondering if it was the same. So, visited it today.Hal\'s serves Japanese Western food. Things like Japanese hamburger steak with rice. That type of thing. The outside of the restaurant is very pretty, all in wood with wacky curvy windows. The inside of the restaurant is just plain light wood tables and chairs in a minimalistic design.I came in and was given a table immediately. The maitre\'d took some time to fix my table as it wobbled. I thought that was very courteous. Then he told me that he will return with the menu. That\'s when things started to go downhill. I waited 10 minutes and no one returned with a menu. Not only that, I had no place setting as well. So, I sat by myself for 10 minutes, no menu and no place settings. Just a blank empty table. FINALLY ... after a bit of waving, a waiter came by and I asked for a menu and perhaps a place setting? The waiter apologized and came back quickly with one and offered me a glass of water. This is after waiting 10 minutes for someone to come by and only after asking for some attention.Lunch menu consisted of various Japanese favorites including Japanese hamburger, tempura, Japanese curry and pork cutlet and sushi. Prices weren\'t expensive. Probably ranging around $100 - 200.I decided on Hal\'s hamburger steak with spaghetti with sauteed assorted vegetables. It included a salad, miso soup, rice and coffee or tea. ($98). I added an extra $30 for poached egg and garlic as I always think Japanese spaghetti tastes better with a poached egg.1I was given the salad pretty quickly after I ordered. It was alright. Salad greens were crisp. It had a very grainy version of Thousand Island sauce as dressing. It was a decent portion.salad0saladAfter the salad, I waited 30 minutes for the rest of my meal. I wasn\'t sure why it took so long but I waited anyways. And when it came, I was surpised that it was cold. I waited 30 mintues for the food. Did that mean, the food sat at the service window for 30 minutes as well and that is why it was cold??Anyways, the set also had a small plate of Japanese pickles. There was also a bowl of rice. It\'s very Japanese. However, I wasn\'t given chopsticks and when I looked around me, I saw everyone else had chopsticks along with knives, forks and spoons. How was I to eat the rice without chopsticks? A fork? After waving for a good while for some sort of attention, I was finally given chopsticks.0The miso soup was ok. Nothing exciting about it. Just regular miso you get at any low end Japanese. It was also the only thing in my lunch set that was warm..miso soup0miso soupThe poached egg was poached in the cup and was all broken. Obviously, not poached the regular way. It was also ... cold. It wasn\'t just cold. It was ice cold. The amount of spaghetti is exactly what you see before you. The exact amount it takes to make a swirl with your fork. So, having a poached egg on top made it drown out the pasta into one big watery mess instead of soaking up all the yolky goodness. The pasta was also cold. I can\'t even say it was al dente as it was just plain hard and wirey. The ""assorted vegetables"" on the menu were few pieces of spinach on top of the one forkful of pasta. I added $30 for not only poached egg but garlic. Garlic was a total of 2 slices of fried garlic. I should have opted for the mushrooms. The hamburger steak was cold and a major over use of pepper. Izumi Curry makes a better Japanese hamburger steak and that\'s just really sad. To it\'s credit, the sauce on the hamburger steak was quite nice. It had a subtle sweet flavor. Too bad the hamburger itself had way too much pepper, the sauce was drowned out.Hal\'s hamburger steak with spaghetti and poached egg...0Hal\'s hamburger steak with spaghetti and poached egg...I noticed a couple beside me ordered sets and only one came. The other came after the other person finished her meal and they waited a further 15 minutes before the other was served. I suggest they watch Hell\'s Kitchen and learn ... all food goes out to the same table at the same time.To the restaurant\'s credit, the coffee I ordered that came with the meal was actually really good. It had a rich nutty fllavor. Usually the house coffee for lunch sets are one of three categories for me : tastes like dirt, mediocre or just drinkable. This was actually very good.It took me 2 hours to finish lunch with all the waiting for food inbetween. I\'m glad I had the day off so I wasn\'t in a hurry to leave. It\'s sad as the layout of the restaurant is stylish and nice and I really wanted to like it. But unfortunately, the service and the food was disappointing. I found it amusing that my bill came very quickly after I asked for it ... unlike everything else. I won\'t return.'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-hals/191858?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

Average lunch set would run you about 200$Environment: A bit loud but it was clean and very modern.My colleagues and I have wanted to try this place for around a month now but sadly every time we tried to call in for a reservation (1 or 2 days ahead) or walk in, they would always be full. This time we were smart, and called ahead over a week earlyto secure the lunch reservation! We did not have to wait and got seated instantly.The lunch set menu had quite a lot of options and contained many options all ranging from 150-250 dollars minus the occasional Deluxe sashimi options which would cost upwards of 350$.Environment: The restaurant is new addition to Pacific place and took the spot of the old Gigasports.. but I might be wrong. It was very clear, well renovated to provide a very minimalistic modern feel. The lights were not too bright so it was a comfortable social environment minus the sound. It might have to do with the fact that it was a Friday or the acoustics of the restaurant made it sound like there were easily double or triple the amount of patrons there actually were, The reception at our seat was very poor as it took us forever to realize our colleague was still waiting outside for us since her calls/texts were not getting through. Either way, we were all very pleased with the service, dcor and venue.Food and Pricing: We all chose to order the 268 Deluxe Sushi set since it was a Friday gathering and we all deserved a little bit of indulging. The set came with a salad, soup and Chawanmushi. Nothing really stood out but nothing disappointed either. The sashimi was fresh, Uni included and that is quite a feat itself. I think the overall presentation could have bit a bit higher end but it was fine as it is. The pricing as I mentioned was a bit on the higher end but at least the quality of the food reflected, for the most part, what the price suggested. This is not always the case in hk!Now what the title is leading to... On Openrice there is an ad mentioning a 500 Asia Mile reward and complimentary dessert after spending 1000 HKD. Given it was our own fault for not asking the staff, I feel like we missed out on this! and the staff did not even ask!!! So we ended up missing out on 500 Asia miles and a dessert.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/admiralty-hon10/522805?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

The price was shocking and the wait is on the long side!!  But worth every dollar!   I ordered a sake chicken mushroom  udon.   Soup was superb (highly recommend for ppl who like sweeter soup).  It has lots of longan, that gives it a slightly sticky and sweet texture.   was marinated separately with delicious sake taste.

Very disappointed, no wonder there is few people even on a bank holiday.', 'Recommended: Yasai (Vegetable Ramen).  - """" It\'s such a convenient lunch option that I\'ve tried it two days after my first visit! This time I arrived a bit later after bringing a few old photographs to one of the numerous galleries in the area for framing (btw, the prices in that area are reasonable). It was 1:40 p.m. and there were plenty of seats available.Again, I\'ve placed my order before I entered the shop. This time I wanted to try ""Yasai Ramen"" (Vegetable Ramen). (+),+Lemon Tea=$64 : 0(+),+Lemon Tea=$64 : Yasai ramen is actually their signature ramen. As far as I\'m aware, this is the only ramen chain in Hong Kong which specialized in this type of ramen. Although the name ""vegetable ramen"", might seem like a rather bland vegetarian option, it\'s in fact stir fried vegetables with sliced pork, ""Chuka style , i.e. the Japanese interpretation of Chinese cooking methods. The whole stir-fry is then placed directly on top of the bowl of ramen.Broth & Okinawa sea salt:Although in Japan, you could choose from a number of soup bases, i.e. Miso, Tonkotsu, Shio and Shoyu, they didn\'t appear to provide such options here. (I never really had a lot of time to look at the menu while standing). The broth here was quite interesting. It appears to me to be a clear chicken broth combined with pork meat soup - I have to stress, not pork bone - soup, perhaps also with a Shio (salt) soup base? The taste was mainly pork meat soup like those home-made ones in Cantonese families. It\'s almost pointless to compare it with shops that specializes in the much thicker Tonkotsu broth, i.e. ButaO or Tamashii, as the broth provided here was a light pork meat/bone soup combined with clear chicken soup (that is ""Tori Gara"" soup - a clear chicken broth usually used in Chuka style cuisines and broths for dumplings in Japan, which used the chicken carcass only, without the skin, as opposed to the thick chicken broth like those in the ramen shop ""Tori Hana"", which is broiled with the whole chicken, including the meat, bones and skin like the Korean Sam Gye Tang.)   A more similar comparison might be with ""Ryo Tei"" which I tried a reviewed recently. They also provide ramen with ""tori gara"" soup base. The tori gara soup base I tried was there was mixed with Shoyu, Japanese soy sauce, which was very good by the way. On the other hand, the tori gara soup base here appeared to have no shoyu but used a Shio soup base. Again, Hachiban stated that they used sea salt harvested near the sea at Okinawa. The sea salt probably accounted for the interesting aftertaste which I initially thought might be a slight hint of ""Aji no Moto"" i.e. Japanese MSG  (MSG was invented in Japan by the way - so I suppose it\'s still authentic Japanese). However, I did not feel thirsty afterwards. I also managed to finish most of the broth without feeling thirsty afterwards. Good!  """"0""""Noodles and lettuce:According to Hachiban\'s website (the essential parts about the ramen were only in Japanese), they used their own brand of lettuce grown in their own farms in Japan. The noodles were also made by their own factory. They had four different types of noodles, thick, medium, thin and very thin. They used the thick ones for their Yasai ramen and I believe the medium one for their chuka soba. I don\'t think they do the thin and very thin version in Hong Kong. This thick noodle had an interesting wheat aftertaste. It\'s quite different from Hokkaido ramen. The noodles were less oily (you can distinguish that as the no-oil version doesn\'t look as transparent as the Hokkaido one) but nevertheless still quite chewy. I enjoyed the texture as well as the portion. Quite a filling lunch. Definitely more filling than the Kimchi Chuka Soba I had here two days ago. The stir-fry consisted of:A lot of beans-sprouts, which is a favorite amongst many Japanese diners (like those provided in ""Hachiyo"", also a favorite amongst many Japanese diners), which were also quite big and tasty.  so chopped carrots. Those were also fresh and quite sweet. some black fungi. Those were probably marinated in salted water overnight. So they got rid of the grassy taste and were very crispy. It\'s delicious. some menma, which were more sour than salty. Average quality. a few slices of pork, which were nothing special and were a bit dried and one thin piece of char siu, which was thin but rather tasty but definitely not a crowd-drawer. It\'s nothing special.  and a lot of very fresh and crisp home grown lettuce. So all in all, the vegetable stir-fry was pretty good. It was fried with some garlic and a hint of black pepper as well, which added complexity to the broth. Good.  I was allocated a seat right at the very end of the small shop. I felt like sitting at a balcony as I was facing directly at the footbridge and overlooking Queens Road. It\'s quite relaxing because of the natural light outside and comfortable air-conditioning, but at the same time, very dynamic, as you are directly facing the people walking on the foot bridge. Infinity ramen pool:  - 0 - I almost forgot to mention the fried prawns. It\'s +HK$7 and you get two fried prawns. +HK$5 for a beverage of your choice.The two fried prawns (not to be confused with tempura) were a bit oily but not bad. The size of the prawns were decent and the flavour was quite strong. The prawns were OK. The freshness was acceptable. It\'s probably marinated before being fried as the flavour was quite strong. All in all, can\'t complaint for HK$7. However, I prefer the cuttlefish tempura a little bit more.The lemon tea was average stuff. Again, no complaints.The whole set plus the drink came down to HK$64 which I find quite reasonable. If you just order the noodle, it\'s HK$52 for a very decent bowl of Yasai Ramen.All in all, a very comfortable and positive dining experience! Recommended for lunch or tea time!  :! - """"""""', 'Highway no.8: After visiting a bookshop in Wan Chai, I wanted to try ""Nha Thrang"" at Hopewell Center. It was pretty crowded so I was desperate to find an alternative. I saw ""Hachiban"" right across the street. While I was fully aware of the ""OK"" & ""Bad comments"" about Hachiban, I note from a photograph of the tea cups in Hachiban that their signature ramen was in fact vegetables with thick ramen , and not pork bone broth ramen. So I felt a bit adventurous: 0 Hachiban was located just at the end of the footbridge across Hopewell center. As I walked nearer, I noticed they were selling a ""Kimchi Cold Chuka Ramen"".  This should be a rather safe option. In fact, judging from the photos provided by other food commentators, the tonkachu soup base doesn\'t seem to ""hold water"" anyway (seemed a bit watery). So I won\'t be in a hurry to order that. On the other hand,they seemed to be quite confident about their vegetables, so I thought "" (Kimchi Hiyashi Chuka) seemed like a safe bet and good for the hot weather. It\'s the first time I saw this ramen on Hong Kong Island. I usually have my Hiyashi Chuka at ""New Kotobuki"" in Jordan after a tired day of work, when I feel like something light and refreshing instead of anything heavy.0I approached and indicated to the polite waiter, dressed in a chef\'s uniform, that I\'d like a seat for one. I was immediately given a menu. I had a quick look. I recall that they had a few lunch sets to choose from, including the infamous pork bone broth ramen  and the famous vegetable ramen (can\'t remember whether you could choose the broth though ) . Those were all reasonably priced. If I remember properly, most of those were between HK$50 - HK$70. Interestingly, as I reach the front of the queue, I could place my order there and then. Even more interestingly, I was asked to pay immediately at the cashier.  [cash only] This saves a lot of time. As the previous customers were preparing to leave, you\'re order is being made at the same time. So ideally, the moment you sit down, you\'re meal should be ready. No time is wasted. Excellent idea especially for the precious lunch time! Efficient!  This streamlined approach felt a bit like a ""drive thru diner"". Incidentally, according to Hachiban\'s Japanese website, the first Hachiban (meaning No.8), was situated in a simple shack next to Highway no. 8 (or Route No.8). Their signature ramen was a simple stir fried vegetable ramen ""Yasai Ramen"". This remains their signature ramen. According to the website, the original shop, which only had 25 seats, could sell up to 1,500 bowls of vegetable ramen per day!  :chopstickAfter a short wait, my Hiyashi Chuka arrived: $580 $58Essentially, the only difference between this Kimchi Hiyashi Chuka and a normal Hiyashi Chuka is, unsurprisingly, the addition of Kimchi. A Hiyashi Chuka is basically a cold ""chuka soba"" noodle cake, cooked, iced/chilled and then served with cucumber, seaweed, sesame, ham, other special ingredients (depends on the shop) and with some vinegar/soy sauce or ponzu. Because conceptually it is a very easy dish to make, the demand on the freshness of each component is very high. I\'m happy to say that though not the best, it\'s pretty good considering the price. It\'s definitely a good option for a quick and light lunch. The cucumbers were good. Nice and fresh. A bit more than most ramen shops which provide Hiyashi Chuka. The ham should be a Japanese type of ham. Those were good too. Not as tasteless as some local brands which used a lot of water and processed meat. The taste was not salty. It\'s just about right.Egg: Absolutely nothing special. Just a normal hard boiled egg cut in half.Kimchi: This was quite good. It\'s a good balance between spiciness and vinegar sourness. It\'s about half/half. It seemed quite crisp and not heavily marinated. So as a result it\'s not that spicy. Because they used some salt to marinate the kimchi, it\'s very crisp.The noodles were quite nice: It\'s apparently made by Hachiban themselves.  Not the best Chuka I\'ve had in Hong Kong (I think those at New Kotobuki were chewier) but overall its not bad and fairly chewy. I\'d like it more if it\'s even more chilled. But definitely nothing to complaint about. The size was average so fine for lunch but not perhaps not for those used to heavy dinners. The nori, i.e. seaweeds were very nice: Definitely not the standard seaweed you buy at supermarkets. I suspect it\'s been grilled before being cut (which is the proper way to bring out the aroma). The taste of the seaweed was mild with very aromatic aftertaste.0The fried squid with spring onions and fried onions was quite delicious too!It\'s basically a tempura made with some chopped squid, spring onions, shredded fried onions as well as some chopped green beans. The squid was quite fresh. the spring onions didn\'t taste like much. The shredded friend onions were fine. It\'s a little bit oily but I\'m quite happy with the overall effect, especially when it\'s only HK$6! Can\'t complaint.0In conclusion:- This shop is famous for their vegetable ramen. However, their Kimchi chuka ramen was pretty good too. - The price was reasonable considering the locality (HK$58) and the size and quality was decent. - If you\'d like to try Hiyashi Chuka or not in the mood for a heavy lunch, this is a decent option in Wan Chai.Worth a trip to the Highway!

277,Hakata Honke,Causeway Bay,Japanese,3.3,88.0,0.0,"A new ramen shop has opened in Hong Kong. This one is a bit different. From Fukuoka, Hanka Honke has been around since 1954. According to their profile, they claim to have started ramen. Yes. THIS RESTAURANT INVENTED RAMEN. However, they didn't do the pork broth based ramen that we are more familiar with. Why? Because that didn't happen then! As ramen history goes, ramen was originally a Chinese noodle. The Japanese literally called it chka soba (Chinese soba). It was much later it changed to other broth types but the original was Chinese based in taste.This is what Hanka Honke was all about. A Chinese based ramen. And that is what I decided to try for lunch.Located inside the new V Point building in Causeway Bay's Tang Lung Street. As it was new, they offer a 20% discount during the month of February.During lunch session, they offer a lunch menu that includes a bowl of ramen, small bowl of rice, a daily yakitori and a salad bar.0Salad bar is located on the side and isn't very big. However, it may not be big but quality of ingredients were very good. They offered okra which was amazing! I had never had okra at a salad bar before. They also had various salad dressings but what I chose was a yuzu dressing. Something I had not seen in a salad bar before as well. This was excellent.0My set came on a tray. Food comes fairly quick. I saw they also included a steamed egg. It wasn't written on the menu so was a nice surprise.0As I was here for their signature ramen, I chose this. The Chinese ramen style for $100. I had never had it Chinese style before so this was interesting. The soup was not salty but had a odd herbal taste. It felt like how I felt when I had Chinese food in Japan. An interesting interpretation of what I know as Chinese food. The noodles were al dente. Their was a slice of char siu that was a bit on that fat side. Noodles do not come with an egg and there is not option to add one.0The steamed egg was ok. Nothing really special about it.0You get a choice of fried rice or takikomi rice. I chose the takikomi rice which was steamed rice flavored lightly with vegetables. This was ok but could have done with a bit more seasoning.0The yakitori was chicken and leeks with teriyaki sauce. Pretty good. Chicken was moist and the sauce was not overly sweet.0For this price and all this food, it was a pretty good deal. The ramen was ok but I'm wondering if it's due to the fact I'm so used to the pork/miso and other based versions and not the original version. Seating is very comfortable. But I'm unsure if I'd be back especially as there is so much ramen competition in just this street alone.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-hakata-honke/518938?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

282,Harbour Kitchen,Wan Chai,Chinese,2.2,100.0,10.0,"Went to the convention centre for an exhibition last weekend. Need to grab lunch before going to the exhibition halls. Perhaps it was lunch hour, there were 3-4 groups of people quieing for table when we got there.Ordered shredded pork fried noodles, sweet and spicy pork neck fried instand noodles, roasted pork, kaya polo-bun, iced coffee and hot ribena with lemon. To our surprise, after the drinks are being served, the kaya polo-bun was served first. Weird, because this is supposed to be the desserts (sweet). We didn't start eating but decided to wait for the mains to come. Minutes laters, all other food was served.The sweet and spicy pork neck fried instant noodles was good (instant noodles always the safest choice), not spicy, overall was ok, just a little too salty and oily. But the shredded pork fried noodles was not good all. It was starch gravy with some shredded pork and veges poured over oil-fried noodles. The gravy was plain and little, not enough to cover the noodles. Luckily, they provide some chilli sauce to go with it. Otherwise, the whole dish was pretty much tasteless. I didn't finish the dish because it was plain and dry.The roasted pork was fine - average, not bad but nothing fanstatic to be mentioned. As for the kaya polo-bun, I didn't taste any kaya in it but found some pineapples cubes. Felt weird too, based on my understanding of polo-bun, it actually doesn't have any pineapple ingredients. It was called polo-bun aka pineapple bun in chinese () for its golden yellow, bumped surface which looks like pineapple. Thus, I am not too sure if this restaurant is trying to be different by adding pineapple cubes in it. As a whole, it was quite a pricey lunch for such kind of food standard. We didn't enjoy the food especially the shredded pork fried noodles which was pretty much tasteless.

286,Heichinrou,Central,Chinese,4.2,300.0,,"A couple Saturdays ago, we were having dinner at grandma's, and my aunt said that we were only waitlisted for the dim sum place she booked for the next day. We decided to look for another venue for our dim sum lunch, and my brother and I suggested we go to Heichinrou in Central since it's usually not as crowded on the weekends. We called the restaurant and were able to book a table for the 8 of us right away.My uncle who knows the restaurant pretty well told us that they have a special Dim Sum set lunch on weekends and public holidays that's a pretty good deal, so we already knew we were going to order the set before hand.It was pouring heavily that day, so while most of us were able to get to the restaurant on time, my aunt who has a preference for parking venues had trouble looking for parking and her family didn't get to the restaurant till a little later. The rest of us that were waiting decided to order a few items from the Chef Special Dishes menu.1Items from the Chef Special Dishes Menu were on display in the main dining area of the restaurant, so we could take a look at the items before ordering.11Fish Ball, Pig Skin, Radish$ 651Fish Ball, Pig Skin, Radish$ 65Fish Ball, Pig Skin, Radish: We ordered this dish, that is usually a street food, because grandma is too old to risk eating street food! The fish balls and pig skin were seasoned pretty well and had a decent curry flavor. The radish pieces were much better than the street version. The street food vendors usually cook their radish with other innard items on their menu, so their radish carries the taste of those items. So, the radish at this restaurant didn't have that weird flavor and the natural sweetness of the radish came through much better.Egg, Ginger & Pig's Knuckle in Sweet Vinegar$ 651Egg, Ginger & Pig's Knuckle in Sweet Vinegar$ 65Egg, Ginger & Pig's Knuckle in Sweet Vinegar: The sweet vinegar in this dish was pretty tasty. The eggs were really hard from cooking for so long in the vinegar, which was expected. The Pig's Knuckle wasn't as tender as expected. Overall, the dish is ok.Deep Fried Wonton w/Sweet & Sour Sauce$ 651Deep Fried Wonton w/Sweet & Sour Sauce$ 65Deep Fried Wonton w/Sweet & Sour Sauce1Deep Fried Wonton w/Sweet & Sour SauceDeep Fried Wonton w/Sweet & Sour Sauce: My uncle and I are big fans of this dish, so we always order it when it's on the menu. The version this restaurant serves is the modernized version, so the wontons were more delicate and had the thinner wonton skin. We prefer the old school style with the thick crunchy wonton skin.Deep Fried Wonton w/Sweet & Sour Sauce1Deep Fried Wonton w/Sweet & Sour SauceThe sauce was pretty good with the many different ingredients in it. The sweetness and acidity of the sauce was well-balanced. Deep Fried Wonton w/Sweet & Sour Sauce1Deep Fried Wonton w/Sweet & Sour SauceAfter my aunt's family arrived, we ordered the special Dim Sum set, where you pick 5 dim sums that is served according to the number of people ordering the set, and a vegetable dish is included along with a dumpling soup for each person.1Dumpling in Soup w/Minced Pork & Dried Conpoy1Dumpling in Soup w/Minced Pork & Dried ConpoyDumpling in Soup w/Minced Pork & Dried Conpoy: The soup was quite aromatic, and the dumpling was filled to the brim. However, I prefer the old school version where the soup is within the dumpling, and you have to break the dumpling for the broth to spill out.Cabbage and Bean Curd Sheet with Gingko Nuts1Cabbage and Bean Curd Sheet with Gingko NutsCabbage and Bean Curd Sheet with Gingko Nuts: I have never had cabbage this way, and I found that the bean curd sheets gave a natural sweetness to the cabbage.The dim sum dishes we picked were pretty much on par with other restaurants.Steamed Dumpling w/Turnip, Peanuts & Pork ''Chiu Chow'' style...1Steamed Dumpling w/Turnip, Peanuts & Pork ''Chiu Chow'' style...Steamed Prawn Dumplings1Steamed Prawn DumplingsSteamed Prawn Dumplings: The prawn dumplings were larger than what we are used to, so I can understand why a lot of people recommend them.Chicken Wings w/Ginger Sauce1Chicken Wings w/Ginger SauceSteamed Barbecue Pork Buns1Steamed Barbecue Pork BunsSteamed Barbecue Pork Buns: There was a good amount of delicious filling, and the bun itself was sweet and moist.Steamed Beef Stomach w/Satay Sauce1Steamed Beef Stomach w/Satay Sauce12We ordered theSteamed Rice Flour Roll w/Shrimps from the a la carte dim sum menu since it's a must have item for the family.Steamed Rice Flour Roll w/Shrimps$ 651Steamed Rice Flour Roll w/Shrimps$ 65Steamed Rice Flour Roll w/Shrimps: The rice flour wrapping was not really thin, so it was just ok. The shrimps were pretty large and were not mushy, so that's a plus.Deep Fried Dumpling w/Pork$ 431Deep Fried Dumpling w/Pork$ 43Deep Fried Dumpling w/Pork: This is a personal favorite, so I couldn't resist ordering it after re-reading the menu and saw that the price of the dish is discounted on weekends! The crust of the dumpling was perfectly crispy on the outside and sticky and chewy on the inside!The dim sum set came with dessert, but I was too full to have it already!Heichinrou in Central is a good venue for a relaxing Sunday dim sum lunch. Since the Central office crowd is not around on the weekends, the restaurant is not crowded, and you won't feel rushed during the meal. The service is pretty good, and the servers were quite attentive in changing our plates and refilling the teapots throughout the meal. The weekend dim sum set and discount on the a la carte menu are pretty good deals since dim sum at Heichinrou can be a bit pricey. I would definitely suggest coming to Heichinrou if grandma's favorite dim sum venue is not available again!                Supplementary InformationI deducted a point from the sanitation rating as the bathrooms for the restaurant were located in the shopping area, and you have to go through the stairway area to get to the bathroom and the stairway area was dirty.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-heichinrou/41216?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
287,Ho Hah Restaurant,Wan Chai,Chinese,3.2,25.0,0.0,"My colleagues brought me to have Hong Kong version All Day Breakfast this afternoon. I got a bit excited and curious about what they meant by HK version ADB, so I packed my stuffs and left office immediately. The restaurant was a bit distant from our office, but luckily we did not need to wait for  seating.Luxury Coffee Chaa Chan Ten was a very old fashioned Chaa Chan Ten, simple circular wooden table and circular stool. No fancy menu, just simple black words on yellow background paper which got laminated. A stainless steel bucket containing dozens of orange plastic chopsticks. Order receipt was just the roughest grey paper with quality even worse than toilet paper, while cashier was just a simple table with a drawer to deposit the money. Food choices were limited, ranged from different kinds of noodles to different kinds of toast or bread. Although it did not have the furnishing and diversions of food choices as of what Tsui Wah can offers, this is what we love about old fashioned Chaa Chan Ten.1) Satay Beef Noodles $14So I finally realized what my colleague's ADB meant by, noodles and toast. The bowl of noodle was delivered very promptly. The soup base looked normal, bit once you mixed the sauce thoroughly, the whole bowl turned into yummy brown satay sauce. The satay sauce was very rich and tasty. It wasn't spicy at all. Most of the beefs were tender and easily chewable. Despite some typical beef slices, there were also some beef pieces in the bowl! The noodles however were rather soft. The bowl was average but the satay sauce was good!2) Toasted Corn Beef Egg Toast $10 ($9 + $1 for toasted)Everyone was ordering an extra toast, so I reckon I should order one too. Corn Beef is always my favourite, so I decided to try one in Luxury Coffee. This toast took longer than all the other toasts my colleagues ordered. I bet it's because they had to fry it before serving it? The corn beef toast was a bit thin in thickness. The egg was not those fluffy ones, it was pan fried together with the corn beef, so the egg was pretty dried up. It did not taste as nice as I thought it would be, which is pretty disappointing, as I thought corn beef toast was something easy to make. If you love corn beef toast, I highly recommend Tsui Wah's ones, it was by far the best I have tasted.Everyone around me ordered different kinds of thick toasts which looked extremely nice! Most of the toast were thickly sliced, except those that goes with egg(or those $10 ones lol). The thick sliced toast were just $6-8 each, may be I should give it a try next time!www.cinnamon4coffee.blogspot.comSatay Beef Noodles. Average but have nice satay sauce...0Satay Beef Noodles.

288,Ho Hung Kee,Causeway Bay,Chinese,3.6,119.4,0.0,"To get a meal for two for less than $300 at somewhere with a Michelin star is something of a miracle. The loud, napoloenoesque decor is slightly harsh, and the service is so so, but the price is great and the food fantastic. Beef noodles might sound a little punchy at $108 but for that you get a HUGE plate of delicious noodles. The beef was really tasty and plentiful. We also chose a prawn wonton soup which was dirt cheap and very tasty. Some spring rolls came as a side and they were very nice. There is alcohol available though wasnt listed on our menu. Tea is included for a couple of bucks. Not quite sure how or why it gets a star, but it does, and for that you cant go wrong for minimal cash.', 'The food was excellent on a recent visit, but the service was poor and management supervision lacking as raucous cleaning was allowed adjacent to our table and other diners.The wontons were delicious and among the best we have had in Hong Kong  thin, translucent skins wrapped around a generous amount of shrimp. The char siu bao were possibly also the best with very light dough around an ample and tasty filling of barbecued pork. The fried rice noodles with beef in black bean and pepper sauce was an ideal preparation, the beef very tender and the sauce perfectly balanced. We also tried a small order of fragrant minced fish balls with clam which were tender and subtly flavored. Fish balls, though a big Hong Kong favorite, are not necessarily ours, but these were quite interesting and well-prepared.We did have several complaints about management. When one item we ordered had not arrived after a long wait, we inquired and it was obvious it had been overlooked. It was brought in a short time. While we were still eating, some women started cleaning nearby, talking loudly, spraying cleaning liquids in the booth across the aisle from us, and cavorting rather rambunctiously. Another time a woman came to our table, reached over it unceremoniously and replaced one of the condiment dishes. It did not seem fitting for this to happen in a Michelin one-star rated establishment. I have to note that we did arrive at 3 p.m. for a late lunch, and the restaurant customers had thinned out by the time we were eating, but it struck us that good management would have had the cleaning done away from occupied tables.We would definitely go back for the excellent food, but we would hope the management would be a bit more pulled together when we return.Fried rice noodles with beef in black bean and pepper sauce - Rice noodles with beef in black bean and pepper sauce...$ 1050Fried rice noodles with beef in black bean and pepper sauce - Rice noodles with beef in black bean and pepper sauce...$ 105Wonton soup$ 550Wonton soup$ 55Noisy cleaning across from table0Noisy cleaning across from tableCleaning opposite diners0Cleaning opposite diners', ""Great ambience, polite staff and wonderful food!!

A friend and I stopped here for a quick lunch and were seated quickly even though it was rush hour. We shared the beef ho fan, which was fantastic, as well as a simple choy sam with oyster sauce, plus a shrimp cheung fan from their dim sum menu. Prices were reasonable, especially given the location in a shopping mall. Will definitely be back to try more specialities.', 'Arrived at noon sharp on a Saturday, immediately seated, the place was not full. Ordered for a large size wonton noodle, they initially bought me a receipt with a small dish order, promptly rectified. The place was very clean, and the atmosphere very artificial and not typical.The large size noodle distinguished from the small size only for the number of wontons in it (I think the small size has 4 and the large size 6), otherwise the quantity of noodles and the size of the bowl is the same, really small (it seems a side soup order at a first glance). The soup is not very tasteful, the consistency of the noodle quite hard but without leaving a nice sensation. The signature wontons extremely small, and not so different in taste than the ones from any other cheap canteen. The price is at least one and a half time the same order as it can be found elsewhere, and it is not justified given the quality; other dishes on the menu (dim sum mostly, not tried) were way more overpriced.Supplementary InformationAsk for a service charge over the menu prices.'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-ho-hung-kee/114105?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

292,Holy Crab Bar and Restaurant,Central,American,3.4,508.3,0.0,"Four of us made a reservation and checked out the Weekend All You Can Eat brunch. Definitely good value for money if youre seriously into seafood but these people would be hung, drawn and quartered for calling this stuff Low Country Boil with bell peppers, onion, celery; The holy trinity. Its like offering Classic French onion soup and serving it with white bread and American cheese on top. Its an insult to the French and they get insulted enough already.Low country boil is a classic Southern American/Cajun stew that BY LAW must have Old Bay seasoning or at least crab boil seasoning, besides the Holy Trinity of vegies. This had none of that; no seasoning and no veggies. Just bland boiled seafood. Very disappointing if you ever had Low Country Boiled seafood ... or had a mother that loved you enough to put salt in the boiling water.Are these the same guys who had Blue Smoke Bar-B-Que that was on the 3rd floor of Grand Progress Building, right next door to Holy Crab? It would seem so as both have no idea what southern cooking is.Now that the main complaint is out of the way, on the rest of the experience.They advertise a choice of crab, shrimp or lobster. On this day, they also had all you can eat clams. So, being 4 of us, we got 1 of each. Plenty to eat except for the guy who ordered the clams. After 2 pails of clams (they are really quite small but its all you can eat so no problem), they announced they were all out. OK, he switched to lobster. And then on the way out, we passed the tanks of seafood, 2 of which were full of clams. WTF? If you want to offer All You Can Eat, then you should have ample supply or at least not cut me off when you have a ready supply. Its just lazy that they keep half for the dinner rush. Running out, ORDER MORE. Its called stock management.Along with the All You Can Eat seafood, you get 2 other courses. First, a choice of biscuits and sausage gravy, Crab benedict or herb cake benedict. All were we well received but I love the heart clogging biscuits and sausage gravy so I ordered it. It arrived while we were deep in conversation and I was 2 bits into it before I realized they served me crab benedict instead. Sh*t, I was really looking forward to the biscuits.2nd course was a fruit salad or Caesar salad. My Caesar salad had almost no dressing at all and was disappointing. I heard the fruit salad was good. Hard to screw it up; cut fruit, put in bowl. Simple.Oddly enough, the highlight of the day was the holy punch. Very nice, little sweet and refreshing. Great for all that seafood. At $180 a jug, its a bit pricy for fruit juice but a worth it to me.Total cost, $2700 for 4 ($675 each) is OK if you can gobble down mass quantities of quality seafood but I would have paid more to get REAL Low Country Boil, or at least not to have been tricked in by their deceitful advertising.I might go back, especially if they offered REAL Low Country Boil but I know what Im going to get. On second hand, I can a get all you can eat seafood anywhere in town with additional choices. After all, this is Hong Kong and life is too short to eat bad food.', ""I saw my friends posted up in their face book when they visited this restaurant last weekend for brunch. Those pictures of they took and posted up was looking very delicous.So I and my two friends decided to go for it as our friends told us it's only $418+ per person and there is no time limits. Hey! We have time on weekend and thats the place that we are looking for. We all knew that Hong Kong brunch nowadays is getting expensive and still they out time limit to it. Forget it! I won't want to eat so fast. Anyway, let's go back to our experience in Holy Crab.There was quite fullwhen we got there around 12:30pm and lucky we got booking.The managergreeted us at the door and escort us to oFish Tank0Fish TankBrunch Menu0Brunch Menuur table. We got bench seating and it's comfortable and spacious. It's 12:30pm and we are very hungry and we could smell theseafoods in the dining area!     We sat down and the manager explained to us the Bottomless SeafoodBrunch Set. We just told her straight that we come for this menu and she gaveus a big smile and say we make the right choice.    . We gotserve complimentary a shot of Virgin Pina Colada before our1st Course is serve. That really freshen upour day!  . We ordered twomug of Holy Punch and looks great and it has fresh pineapple in it. Ok, here start our brunch. Round 1............I choosed Crabs and Meat Benedict and my friend choosed Southern Swimmer Benedict. There is 3 choices in Round 1. Another one is called Southern Love on a plate. ( It's a homemade sausage patties with scrambled eggs on buttermilk biscuits ) We felt it's safer to ordered Benedict. We were told later that if we like to have another plate of benedict is also fine. We just cannot believe it!    .Then Round 2 is like Something Lite........our friends last time ordered their Caesar Madness. So we were thinking to choose Caesar Madness or Southern Living Fresh Fruit Salad. Finally we both selected Caesar Madness. The Caesar Salad comes in decent size and the dressing is perfect blend with Romaine Lettuce. We both enjoyed it indeed.Then the final Round is ..............Bottomless Seafood Bucket........       .....We now get ready to digest our starter and caesar! We started with Jumbo Tiger Prawns Bucket and we got to finish one bucket by bucket. So that fair enough not to waste food.We came here for this and couldn't believe that next is Boston Lobster Bucket and next is Snow Crab Legs Bucket. We kept ordering after buckets and buckets. Thats why they called it Bottomless Seafood.     .From 12:30pm, we ate till 4:00pm and we just cannot moved at all. Hahahahaha! We need wheelchairto get us out. The staff just kept asking us for refill, this is what I called good service. TheBottomless is until 5:00pm but we really cannot eat anymore. We wish we have4 stomach.      . Anyway, we just pay $418+ and we walked our super full and wemaking plan now to get our friends in group fornext weekend gathering.We told our friends who dined here and Thank you for her recommendation to us. Good Choice and Good Value for money in Lan Kwai Fong! We believe there is no other place in town can offer this deal. Try it yourself and you will know it."", ""It was cool to check out the place, but with unpredictable seafood prices (the only predictable part was the prices ain't gonna be cheap), horrible soggy chips and doughy corn fritters that could choke a dog, cajun wings that had a one-dimensional taste to it, mushy prawns with too much batter, not even the good seafood stew could make me go back again.Po boy sandwich, seafood, Cajun wings, SF cioppino (seafood stew without the bread)...0Po boy sandwich, seafood, Cajun wings, SF cioppino (seafood stew without the bread)...""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-holy-crab-bar-and-restaurant/437906?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

Full of texture and freshly prepared. You can tell it is home-made and no MSG. Plating was fair. The options for add on beverages were also appropriate for a lunch like this. The staff were cheerful but I must say they are not very efficient. There was no one before me and I still had to wait for 10min to get my food.

My friend had asked for an chicken burger which they did not have but it was on the menu, so she then asked for a vegetarian burger instead (as shown on menu) again they did not have only as they did not stock up. We all had the regular cheeses burgers at the end with sweet potatoes fries and regular fries.

Despite being off the High street, it can still get quite busy with a capacity of around 16-20 (with a squeeze) and the fact it can get busy is a testament to the quality of the burgers.I usually build up an appetite before I go here and choose a big one like the 'Honbo 2.0'. With 4 x 2oz patties and triple cheese I don't really need to mention whyHonbo 2.00Honbo 2.0The burgers are very good; succulent and juicy and you can see all the chunks of minced beef as you bite into it and it softly tears apart. I think being thin, you get more of the crispiness, which helps steer you away from the monotony of a squidgy meat patty found in other places. It's not exactly cheap, but reasonable if you use some promotional offers.The fries are thin cut, crispy and come with a nice creamy and tangy, mayo-based dipping sauce. I won't usually have any sauce but it makes a nice change from the usual condiments. I've tried the cheese fries also before, which were OK but the cheese didn't seem so wholesome and it was a bit filling for my liking. The last and only time I tried the sweet potato fries, I was disappointed as it was really chunky and didn't seem very well cooked.FINAL VERDICT:TASTY BURGERS AND RELAXED AMBIENCE"", ""Like the Cantonese pinyin the restaurant name uses, Honbo serves hamburgers. The place isn't very big but it's located in a quiet corner of the Star Street area.0I arrived on a Saturday and it wasn't very busy. They gave me a menu with a few burger options. Menu in English only. There is no 10% service charge.1They also offer a variety of drinks including beer.0Apple Pie Ice Tea ($38). This was great. It had all the apple pie spices in this drink! It even had a slice of apple in it.0Cheeseburger ($98). The burger, on the other hand was ok. The size was a bit small. The bun was soft and fluffy. The meat patty was moist. There was some lettuce and pickles. The cheese was runny but seemed like processed cheese. The sauce taste like thousand island. The entire burger didn't hold well. The sauce ran every where and it started to fall apart on me after a while. It was ok, but for $98 I expected more.0With Butcher's Club just down the street, I don't think I'd be back as they do a much better burger for about the same price. Though the ice tea here was great, I'd probably just order a drink."", 'Theres not too many things I actually get cravings for; but I will admit that a good hamburger is something that I sometimes have a physical craving for.Maybe not such a good thing; all of the best burgers are pretty much not so healthy, so eating them too often can be a problem.The girl gets around that problem by having vegetarian burgers.. but, well, you know; thats a crap solution for a massive carnivore.So, Im always on the lookout for a burger that is both fulfilling and slightly on the healthy side.Recently, we were wandering around our local hangouts in Wanchai and noticed that a new burger joint had opened up. Taking up a very small spot on Sun Street, Honbo seemingly popped up overnight and looked like the type of place Id like to check out. With a cool vibe and inside/outside seating, I was keen to check out if they did decent burgers as well.0A self styled grassroots burger joint, connected to local farmers, brewers and artisans; Honbo fills its burgers with local and sustainable produce. With vegetables harvested in Yuen Long and their signature potato milk buns baked only fifteen minutes away; the local burger joint seems to be targeting environmentally conscious diners.I guess, apart from the beef!Anyway; weve visited Honbo a couple of times now and I have to say that the burgers are pretty good. Weve had a good selection of the burgers on the menu; however with one major exception. Each time weve been, the vegetarian burger noted on their menu has been unavailable.0My favourite burger so far has been the Classic Burger; a 4oz beef patty with pickles (picked out of course), lettuce and the house sauce. Im a simple guy when it come to burgers, so the classic is just about perfect for me; theres a great balance of bun to salad to beef patty, although Id like a slightly thicker patty cooked medium. The house sauce is sweet with just a little zing. For me, the main issue with the burger is that theres no tomato; ya gotta have tomato in a burger!2The Cheese Burger is pretty similar to the classic, the big difference being the inclusion cheese; so if your preference is for something with melty cheese, then this could be a good option for you.0The most interesting burger on the menu is the Soft Shell Crab Burger; the generous serving of battered soft shell crab is accompanied by a bread n butter slaw and old bay mayo. Theres an interesting variant with the burger, the inclusion of either dye or squid ink in the buns, making them black as the night.1The burgers are pretty good at Honbo, but its the fries that the little burger joint really excels. The triple cooked golden Fries were actually better than those I had at Two Starred Dinner by Heston Blumenthal. Definitely a must if your a fries fan. While Im personally not a fan of the Thick Cut Sweet Potato Fries, the girl rates them as the best shes had too.00While the burgers at Honbo are good, theyre not my favourite burgers in town, that honour goes to the Butchers Club; but they are light and relatively healthy.Definitely worth checking out @FoodMeUpScotty000001', '0I\'m not much of a burger person, but newly opened burger joint Honbo caught my eye for two reasons - its photo-worthy shopfront and its unconventional menu, featuring the likes of scallop and soft-shell crab burgers.Honbo prides itself as a grassroots burger place, using locally-sourced ingredients to make the finest burgers. Their vegetables are grown in Yuen Long and potato milk buns are baked ""just 15 minutes away"".Scallop burger$ 1280Scallop burger$ 128Soft shell crab burger$ 1180Soft shell crab burger$ 118The scallop burger consists of two perfectly pan-fried sashimi-grade scallops, piquant pico de gallo and Japanese mizuna (mustard greens). The scallops were fresh and sweet, cooked perfectly with the seared flavour really coming through.For the soft-shelled crab option, an entire crab is deep-fried and sits atop a bed of red cabbage slaw. The shell was light and crispy, revealing a soft and fleshy interior.French fries0French friesSweet potato fries0Sweet potato friesBoth orders of fries were delicious. Although unsightly, we preferred the sweet potato fries to the regular fries. 00Verdict: great little burger place with a storefront that\'s perfect for makeshift photoshoots. Love the retro American diner vibe of this place.If you like my photos or want more food reviews, check out my food, lifestyle and travel blog!https://www.themerakiguide.com/blog/2017/4/8/honbo-review', 'Don\'t want to read the long post?Quick summary:Food: Surprisingly decent. Burger was a bit small, fries compensated for it. Taste was above averagePricing: Typical Western burger joint pricing. Cheapest option being just under 100 with more attractive items stretching into the mid 100s.Environment: Store is small and cozy and very cleanDecided to eat here with a few colleagues after our plan A fell through and was surprisingly did not regret it.As it was still a soft opening, the menu options were limited (No regular fries, only Sweet Potato fries) but the regular items that I can being popular were all available. The lone waitress informed us that normal fries were sold out... despite us arriving at 12:05 and clearly the first customers of the joint. This was unsettling and did not leave a good first impression. I\'d rather she come out and say ""We don\'t have regular fries because blah blah blah"". She informed us that there was a ""combo"" that wasn\'t listed which consisted of the ""Honbo"" burger which was their specialty, Sweet potato fries and a soft drink. The 4 of us opted for this option and that was that. One of my colleagues insisted on not having the Sweet Potato fries and finally the waitress somehow came up with a small serving of regular fries... so much for them being sold out.Food:The food took an ample time to come and came out piece by piece, it was rather bizarre. You would expect either 4 burgers to come out together, or the burgers to come with the fries but some of us received fries first, the others burgers. The appearance was a let down as the Honbo featured 2 2oz patties but after a bite in, i was genuinely surprised. The burger was cooked well, seasoned well and the way they had structured it was perfect ratio of bread/meat. This was a major bonus. The fries were visually unattractive but after a bite, it was quite delicious (granted it was a bit oily). I can only imagine that the normal 4oz patty may be a much more satisfying burger and the fact that they didn\'t any add-on options, i was quite disappointed.Environment:The restaurant was nice, it was clean and new (probably because it was actually just really new). The seating however was a bit awkward with 3-4 high tables on the edge with 1 big communal table as a lot of office-area restaurants like to do nowadays. It makes for potential parties of 4 to either be too cramped or have way too much space and the dreaded ""dap toi"" (sharing a table) is required after a few more people come.All in all i would recommend this place but not the honbo burger. The burgers are small enough so that you can enjoy it without feeling too full so downsizing to 2 oz patties would be unrecommended. The fries were decent but a tad oily so prepare for that! Hopefully they come out with a few more options to add things like cheese, an extra patty or bacon; that would be welcomed by a lot of potential customers!'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/wan-chai-honbo/522819?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
296,Hong Kong Lao Shang Hai Restaurant,Wan Chai,Chinese,3.0,150.0,0.0,"It is one of those Shanghainese restaurants that have been around for ages, where you would be served with authentic Shanghainese cuisine at affordable prices by grandpas who would candidly advise you on what to order. Here we are the two of us for lunch on a weekday and managed to get a last minute booking. Lunch sets start from about 200ish for two, or you could also order a la carte, which gives you more choices. Today, we ordered smoked eggs, jelly fish, ma lan tou, shredded tofu sheet cooked with dried shrimps, and fish head cooked in a clay pot. Smoked eggs - done perfectly with the right balance of marinates, added on top a flavoursome and silky yolk (note that the yolk here is larger than the ones you find at most restaurants and they use duck eggs here rather than chicken eggs which carry a stronger flavour)Jelly fish - typical shanghainese fare, no disappointment nor surprise hereMa lan tou- again a typical shanghainese appetiser that never disappoints (though some people might find the grassy flavour a bit off putting)Shredded tofu sheet cooked with dried shrimps- I would usually order shredded tofu sheet cooked with Chinese ham and chicken but today I decided to try this version instead which was cooked with dried shrimps, not a smart choice, stick with the Chinese ham and chicken version if you could, otherwise not worth ordering Fish head cooked in a clay pot - not bad but could not say it was superb, the fish head was fresh and they put cassava noodles in it which absorbed all the flavours from the dish. The  sauce was made with soy sauce, sugar, Chinese wine etc, and carries a strong flavour, which is typical in Shanghainese cuisine. I remember having a similar dish at Hang Zhou Restaurant, which was superior to this dish here. 0000', 'Not sure why this restaurant was so popular...

297,Hong Zhou Restaurant,Wan Chai,Chinese,3.3,383.3,0.0,"Quite an unassuming-looking place from the outside, thisrestaurant apparently offersthe most authentic Hangzhou cuisine in HK. I've been here a few times and it's always full to the bursting point during meal times, so reservations are probably necessary the vast majority of the time.We ordered fish ball soup--unlike the firm, bouncyfish balls common in Hong Kong, these fish balls are very large, soft, soggy and barely holds together, apparnetly because they are made from actual pureed fish with no added ingredients (?). I thought the fish balls tasted watery and was unimpressed, but my dining companion, who is from around the Hangzhou region, assured me this dish is very authentic and fresh. The soup was a disappointment, asit was so very obviously MSG soup (boiled water with a little veggie and lots of MSG)--I liked MSG soup growing up but getting it at a not-inexpensive restaurant as part of a premium fish ball dish? Not so much. This isn't an one-off event, either, this soup is regularly MSG-like, because I had the same dish during lunch a couple of days before at the same restaurant. My favorite was the nice stir-friend rice cake, which was not too greasy, stir-fried with some veggiesjust to the point of softness, and a very filling, chewy dish. A minor note for families with very young children--we had a baby in tow during my last visit, so we asked for a baby chair. The friendly staff offered a nice, sturdy-looking booster seat that goes on top of a regular dining chair, but there was no seat belt to strap the baby with, so our 18-month old was bobbing precariously on top of the booster seat with nothing to hold him in, which is not ideal. Weended up having to park our baby in the baby stroller instead of having him sit at the table with us. A minor inconvenience.One thing that takes away from the dining experience is the ambience. It always feels like night time here, regardless of whether it's sunny or rainy or pitch black outside, which is ok for dinner but peeves me to no end during lunch hour. 000000000"", 'Hang Zhou Restaurant has always been one of my all time favourite Chinese restaurant in town. It is one of the few restaurants in Hong Kong that specialises in Hangzhou cuisine, which is sort of similar to Shanghainese cuisine but only more delicate with flavours that are more subtle. It\'s recommended by lonely planet and the Michelin guide and it\'s an establishment that\'s been around for ages. More importantly, here you can get real authentic Hangzhou food at reasonable prices right in the centre of town, so what more can you ask for? The only downside I guess is that the decor and service here are typical of just any other Chinese restaurant in Hong Kong, so if you are looking for something hip and fancy, this is not the place for you.Typical Chinese restaurant setting0Typical Chinese restaurant settingPictures of celebrities at the restaurant0Pictures of celebrities at the restaurantNow back to the food, 2 of us spent a total of HK$500 for lunch on a weekday and here are what we had:1. Drunken mud snail   I am not quite sure what the proper english name of this is so I apologise if it\'s not called mud snail. Anyways, these tiny mud snails with soft shells are marinated raw in yellow wine, with a texture that is similar to clams. They are often eaten in the Shanghai and Ningbo area. The flavour is extremely intense, it\'s like the taste of seafood mixed with sweetness explodes in your mouth. It\'s something that you would like if you like drunken crabs. I personally like it but because the taste is so intense, I can\'t take too much of it. Drunken mud snails - Drunken mud snails with intense flavours...0Drunken mud snails - Drunken mud snails with intense flavours...2. ""Evergreen"" cold salad : Again, I don\'t know what the proper name of this vegetable is but according to the restaurant, this is some kind of local vegetables in Hangzhou. The way it\'s made is very similar to , cooked and seasoned simply with sesame oil and salt and eaten cold. The only difference is that the texture of this vegetable is more coarse. Overall, a refreshing dish.\'\'Evergreen\'\' cold salad - A refreshing dish0\'\'Evergreen\'\' cold salad - A refreshing dish3. Duck in sauce  : This is a classic dish where the duck is marinated and cooked in soy sauce and spices such as nutmeg, star anise and cinamon and then left to dry. It\'s salty with concentrated flavours and the texture is a little dry, but this is the way this dish is supposed to be. A well made dish.Duck in sauce - A classic dish0Duck in sauce - A classic dish4. Stir fried eggplant with Hangzhou chilli  : This is a simple vegetable stir fry. The chilli is a tiny bit spicy and I think the eggplant has been slightly deep fried in hot oil in order to retain its purpose colour. The colour of the dish is appetising and I like the combination of the chilli and eggplant. However, some may find this dish a bit too oily.Stir fried eggplant with Hangzhou chilli - Appetizing colours but oily...0Stir fried eggplant with Hangzhou chilli - Appetizing colours but oily...5. Deep fried stinky tofu  : Another well made dish, the tofu is deep fried to perfection and it\'s not oily at all. Like the stinky tofu from street vendors, the tofu here comes with a chilli sauce and sweet sauce. For those of you who are put off by stinky tofu, don\'t worry, it has the fermented tofu taste but it\'s not stinky at all.Deep fried stinky tofu - It\'s so good that I forgot to take a picture!...0Deep fried stinky tofu - It\'s so good that I forgot to take a picture!...6. Fish ball with water shield soup : Water shield is a vegetable that is used to make soup in Shanghai / Hangzhou. It doesn\'t come with a strong taste but it\'s got a funny slimy texture to it. The fish balls here are not the same kind of fish balls that you eat with noodles. Instead, the fish balls here are soft and fluffy, hand made with grass carp fish () . The soup has a light and delicate taste with shreds of Jinhua ham for added flavour, perfect for the summer.Fish ball and water shield soup - Light and delicate taste with soft and fluffy fish balls...0Fish ball and water shield soup - Light and delicate taste with soft and fluffy fish balls...The restaurant gave us red bean soup for free as dessert, it\'s nothing spectacular but it\'s free.Red bean soup - Free dessert0Red bean soup - Free dessertJust a side note, we came here for lunch on a weekday and managed to get a reservation half an hour before we arrived at 12:30pm. The place is quite spacious, so getting a table for lunch, if you don\'t come in a big group, should not be too hard.Posting the lunch menu here - as you can see, prices are reasonable for the quality of food3', 'I was recommended to this restaurant by a celebrity chef in Taipei during a recent visit. We were told that the chef here came from the very expensive leading Hangzhou restaurant in Kowloon, Tian Heung Lau. So my expectation was high.For appetizers, the smoked fish was acceptable, not remarkable. Drunken pigeon had neither pigeon taste nor wine taste. The marinated duck had very little flesh and did not please.The Dong Po pork was fatty, although not very tough. It cannot compare to the one we had in Taipei, though.The smoked yellow croaker fish they recommended was horrible. It was stiff as a board, and obviously had been frozen for a long time. No wonder they needed to put a cherry on each eye, so you would not see the sunken eyes of fish long dead.We ordered noodles tossed with hairy crab roes. The crab roes were acceptable, but not amazing. The noodle was totally unremarkable, and certainly not comparable to those served at Tian Heung Lau in Kowloon. To be fair, per serving here was under $300, but the Tian Heung Lau version, when I last had it over 5 years ago, was already $650.So, to sum up, this is a restaurant that offers food at modest prices using lesser ingredients to economize. Not what I am looking for, I am afraid.'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/wan-chai-hong-zhou-restaurant/13683?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

The beef udon with the set is hot enough, but udon is too soft for my liking. Another thing to point out is that they serve green tea as a set drink...but with no refill at all! I would say green tea at a decent jap restaurant is basic, now they said only with set drink you get ONE glass of green tea.....I am speechless!Also, please remember to bring cash if you want to visit! They only allow credit card for bills over hkd$600! Just during my lunch, at least 3 tables were surprised that they can't use the credit card! I would understand a min charge of $300 for credit card....Overall, a very bad experience and don't think I will ever go back!Sushi set lunch ($178)0Sushi set lunch ($178)""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-hotaru-sushi/461168?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
301,ICHIRAN,Causeway Bay,Japanese,2.6,106.7,17.0,"As recommended by lots of people and websites, this time finally got a time to taste ramen in ICHIRAN.First there was a staff leading you to the sit. Then you would get a menu to choose your preferred ramen.Press the button and there would be someone inside the corridor and take your order.The cooking time is short. It was just around 5 minutes.Water could be freely refilled by yourself.There was only one single product that you could choose. I would say the soup was a bit oily but the spicy one was definitely worth a try.As the tradition of respect to the chef, it was a good choice to drink all the soup and let the bowl empty.The taste was okay. Just an average and not really thought it deserved a lot of praise compared to other Japanese Ramen Restaurants.Finally 10% service fee was charged.Price List of the food0Price List of the food000', 'The queue is more wow effect than the food itself , pricy for a ramen soup , the product itself due the mass people visit this restaurant can see it looks and taste industrial , it worth to go again ? Nope The queue was more impressive than the food itself , I wonder how a place in HK become so popular if taste flat , even the restaurant itself oppressing, seats , small table, facing a curtain , I wonder if it want to recreate the feel of Japan they forget about even restaurants there are tide and thin still find the warm feeling , here in this one in HK not at all .', 'After trawling through Openrice in an effort to find a place to continue my food adventures, I stumbled across the famous Ichiran in Hong Kong, a Japanese restaurant which claims to concentrate only on Tonkotsu Ramen and seeks to deepen the flavour of every bowl as its one and only mission. After a moment of dj vu and remembering a recommendation from a friend, I decided to lock it in as a must-eat for today.Located on the relatively quieter Jaffe Road in Causeway Bay, its best to take the C exit from the MTR station and its only a short walk from there. I had an ominous feeling as I could feel the construction dust from the sites surrounding the restaurant clog up my lungs. I promise though, the dust didnt at one point impede my taste buds. Once you turn the corner, you should be greeted by the attention-seeking crimson sign. Reading prior reviews on Openrice, I had come prepared to stand in line for an hour or so just to gain entry into the restaurant. To my pleasant surprise, 11:45am would be an intelligent time of arrival as there was nobody to be seen (there was nobody when we left either). Another sign, I guess, of what was to come.The broth was bland and its flavour could do with a little bit more deepening.Upon entering the store, we (I came with a friend) were greeted with a male staff who as trained echoed the irasshaimase phrase, a standard expectation. He then proceeded to seat us in Cantonese. The dcor of the store was nicely presented and reflected the environment of its Japanese branches. The private cubicle was narrow and secluded, the perfect setting for those seeking to slurp through their noodles without any judgement  though you might want to rethink it if you are taking a girl on a first date. Aligned across the top of our tables were some instructions in Japanese, English and Chinese for first-timers, slightly condescending albeit helpful.Here were my choices:Flavor Strength: MediumRichness: MediumGreen Onion: ThinSliced Pork: WithIchirans Original Red Sauce: HalfNoodles Texture: Firm+ Half Boiled Egg (101HKD or 15AUD)In retrospect, I wouldve chosen regular red sauce if I had known that it was not that spicy and kae-dama (extra noodles) were it not for such an early lunch. Now onto the nuts and bolts.The noodles were presentable though while the pork portions were nothing to boast about, they could have made a better effort to make them float. Despite its commendable consistency, the broth was bland at best and its flavour could do with a little bit more deepening in my bowl, even if you take into account medium richness and flavour. Noodles were done firm as ordered and the pork had extremely tender texture, a far cry from the rubbish have in Sydney (except Ippudo). The Red Sauce was interesting and left me craving for more with barely a tingling sensation reminding me that I had actually asked for some. However, they absolutely missed the beat when they forgot to serve our eggs with our noodles and needed a reminder. That being said, their eggs were done just right and almost the best part of the meal. Their staff while well-mannered were not very enthusiastic and almost mechanical. They would also do with some Japanese classes to enhance their choppy and often off-putting pronunciation which definitely spoiled the authentic experience.Overall, while the noodles were definitely good, it would not be a place I would be willing to wait an hour or so for. Luckily, my mood was much better since I beat the line and got in early. The entire experience was quite Japanese and their interesting and authentic dcor did earn them some extra points. Openrice thought they were a winner but for me they were, dare I say: slightly overrated.Ambience: 4/5Service: 2/5Food: 7/10Overall Verdict: 7/10'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-ichiran/140523?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

303,IPPOH tempura restaurant,Central,Japanese,4.6,1000.0,0.0,"0You really do need to stop and look at what's behind the curtain. For over twelve months I walked down Aberdeen Street in SoHo, wandering by a little yellow restaurant that had it's door partially obscured by a heavy curtain. Sure, I knew that it was a Japanese restaurant, the name gave it away. A little research may have piqued my interest much sooner, but the name of that little restaurant really meant nothing to me. Ippoh! Boy has that changed! It wasn't until a workmate, lets call her Zoe, wanted to help me celebrate my recent birthday with a special lunch time treat. She'd been telling me for a long time that her favourite Japanese restaurant in Hong Kong was Ippoh, and wanted to see if I agreed; so we made our way through Central to SoHo and our midday booking. It was a lightbulb moment for me. Finally the curtain was pulled back and we entered the tiny little tempura style restaurant, and seated at one of the eight spots available at the bar style dining room. All eight seats put diners right in the action where the Ippoh head chef (I never did get his name!) was busy preparing the tasty morsels that would be lightly tempura and fried right before out eyes. There were a couple of options for lunch, the YUKI course which consisted of eight pieces of tempura or the OMAKASE lunch, which was a much more comprehensive journey. No prizes for guessing which we chose. 0 Ippoh has been in Hong Kong for only a couple of years, opening in it's Aberdeen Street location in 2014, but there is a much longer and richer history to the little Japanese tempura restaurant. With a history that spans over a hundred years, the original Ippoh is located in Osaka and is one of the most respected tempura restaurants in Japan. The fact that our chef for the day was a fifth generation tempura chef spoke volumes about how seriously Ippoh is about presenting the very finest quality produce, where is imported fresh each morning from Tokyo's Tsukiji market. Very shortly after being seated, we were presented with all of the dining equipment that we'd need for our meal; I loved the seriousness and ceremony with which our setting was presented. As I played with the chopsticks, waiting for the meal to commence, our waitress complimented me on my technique. I have to say, I was pleased that she'd noticed and commented.... 0 0 A beautiful little bowl was first to arrive, filled not with tempura but a sliver of incredibly fresh halibut wrapped around spring vegetables and bathing in a pool of ponzu sauce. The simple freshness of the fish was sublime with the ponzu, which gave enough of a bite to perfectly balance the halibut. 1 It was almost mesmerising as we watched our chef prepare our tempura pieces, the first of which just about redefined my concept of fresh and delicious. A large prawn had been presented along with a green pepper, the tempura batter on each golden and almost translucent. Each was given an order and instructions about which accompaniment to use, the salt or the radish infused tempura sauce. 1 1 The first bite of my prawn left me dumbfounded. I'd had amazing produce before, many times in fact, but the light sweetness of the prawn, combined with the tempura and just a touch of salt was so incredibly well balanced that I was rendered speechless. I just closed my eyes and savoured the sweetness and the lightness. My second bite actually finished off the prawn and I was let saddened for a moment that it was gone. 0 I was apprehensive about the green pepper, I'm usually not a fan, but I needn't have worried, there was no bitterness or harshness from the pepper, it was just sweet and crunchy from the tempura. Chef watched us carefully as we ate each exquisite bite, informing us of the best way to devour the tempura, and often the careful backstory of each piece. Kisu, a variant of whiting from Japan was next, specially flown in from Japan that morning. It was ridiculously light and just as divine to eat as the prawn. Miatake mushroom followed, also known as hen-of-wood, the rich earthy flavour of the mushroom was particularly spectacular once shallow fried in the tempura. 1 I've never been a fan of sweet potato and once I learned that the golden wedge in placed in front of me was in fact sweet potato, I prepared myself for a distasteful experience. Again I was dumbfounded, the sweet potato tempura was delicious; I couldn't let it rest, and our chef explained that the sweet potato had been steamed for half an hour making it soft and luxurious. 0 Calamari was next, not a small thin strip like you'd see elsewhere, but a large chunk of squid that had the potential to be rubbery. But by now I had complete trust in the chef, and after a squeeze of lemon and a small dip in salt, the large piece of calamari easily yielded to my bite and, far from being chewy, was tender and sweet and oh-so-more(ish). 0 Understanding how delicious that first prawn was, chef provided us another prawn, this time wrapped in sisho. The slight bitterness of the sisho leaf was a superb contrast of that sweet prawn flesh, the bitterness not so overwhelming and again showing a deft hand by the chef. Probably the only tempura that I didn't enjoy was the eggplant, I guess even a fifth generation tempura chef with mad skills was not enough to overcome the fact that I hate eggplant! 0 I was amazed at the presentation of the uni, which had been wrapped in seaweed and tempura so perfectly that only the outside of the seaweed seemed to have been dipped in the tempura. The strong flavour of the uni was accompanied by a heavy dose of miso, which certainly packed a punch for my palate, but was still nicely balanced. 1 The tasty bites kept coming with Hokkaido scallop providing a lovely hit of sweetness. I'm a huge fan of scallops, the plump soft flesh especially wonderful with that light golden covering of tempura. 1 Sweet corn was next, a long flat section of the corn was presented and provided a new level of flavour, the corn beautiful and sweet, the tempura crunchy, the overall effect perfection. 1 Without doubt, the tempura from Ippoh was the best I'd ever encountered and if that was all I'd devoured on the day, I 'd have though the meal perfect. But, there were elements that were just too much for my western palate! A red miso soup came, presented in a lovely red container, but it was just too powerful for me, I didn't like the smell and the flavour was not to my liking. 0 A bowl of rice was topped with the Japanese version of bubble and squeak, leftover vegetables and some sweet fish. The tempura was nice, but I didn't really eat the rice. 0 It had been a huge meal, with almost too much to eat, I probably would have been happy without the last two dishes, feeling happy and sated just with the tempura. The meal finished simply with some Yuzu sorbet and Japanese plum grapes; simple and refreshing. 1 There was much to love about Ippoh, without doubt one of the best Japanese restaurants in Hong Kong; the tempura was second to none and watching our chef prepare and explain our course in an interactive way was wonderful. It's no wonder it can often take months to book a spot in one of the eight seats. It's a solid reminder that there are so many amazing places in Hong Kong that you can just so easily walk by and never know how close you've come to greatness. Ippoh continues the Japanese tradition of taking every day actions and taking them to an extreme art form. The humble tempura will never be the same, my expectations now at stratospheric levels. Thanks Zoe, for bringing me to your favourite Japanese restaurant! I will be back real soon to visit Ippoh again. Well, SC has declared that I must take her back soon, I was raving so much about the meal. @FoodMeUpScotty 0 1 0 0 0"", ""I'd always prefer Tenmasa over Ippoh if I were to have tempura in Tokyo, but visiting Tenmasa where we are is a bit of a trouble having to travel all the way to Macau, so Ippph is first on the list when convenience is a call.We were lucky, got to be the fill-ins for a cancelled booking and were able to secure 2 precious seats for lunch. Otherwise would have to wait for 2 months to get the dinner booking we originally desired. I was told on the phone by the chef who usually confirms all bookings himself that the omakase menu for lunch is the the same as dinner so what the heck, we're in!With a capacity of only 8 seats around the tempura counter and a table for 4, serving just tempura, the food'd better be good. It IS good, well worth the wait and the price it charges.Setting - the place is small but lots of attention is paid to details like the beautifully engraved exhaust hood and the particularly arranged set of servingware on an Ippoh mat. Food - after the lettuce salad with dried seaweed and the onsen tamago served with mackerel soya jelly, we were set to net the freshest catch of the day straight from Tsukiji Market. We must have had 20 pieces of different kinds of seafood and vegetables, including different kinds of prawns, fishes, abalone, scallop, uni, squid, ginkgo, avocado, asparagus, maitake mushroom and more. All coated in an airy light batter that is briefly crunchy but juicy and tender inside. The chef delicately deep fried every single piece for each and every customer like performing an art, then carefully blotted off any extra oil and put on the netted plate in front of us and patiently explained what the piece was and how best to eat it, whether plain, with salt, with sauce or just a zest of lemon juice. Our meal should be finishing off with tempura prawn cake on rice in soup and dessert which was yuzu sorbet and fresh fruits, but in the end we were so full that we asked for the two to be skipped. However the chef insisted that we should try them because they are too good to be missed. We couldn't reject the enthusiastic chef and agreed to having just 1 rice in soup without the fritter and a dessert to be shared between the two of us. Both didn't let us down which brought our lunch at Ippoh to a complete and impressive ending.Service - typical Japanese courtesy and servicing etiquette that are greatly appreciated. Price - omakase lunch is priced at $1,100 per person which is well worth in my opinion.000000000000"", 'This restaurant is tucked away in Aberdeen Street. The counter only seats 8 people. I went for lunch and was surprised how reasonably priced the fixed set lunch was given that the ingredients are flown in from Japan daily.  They arrive in the afternoon so dinner would be the best time to go if you want the food to be at its freshest.  There is only one set menu for lunch and no a la carte.  I understand that the restaurant is now deservedly popular and the earliest possible seating for dinner would be late November.  Lunch is slightly better being late September. The Tempura batter is light and the seafood is expertly cooked by Chef Seki-san,  son of the founder of the restaurant in Osaka. The batter locks in all of the freshness and flavour without being oily. The oil is kept at the perfect temperature in order to achieve this. While not cheap,  given the skill in the preparation and the freshness of the ingredients I would say that lunch is good value.'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-ippoh-tempura-restaurant/175843?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

306,Inagiku Japanese Restaurant,Central,Japanese,3.5,1000.0,0.0,"This is a restaurant that we have been to dozens of times. Whilst it is supposed to be one of the best in town, I am afraid it is not so, in terms of food and even less in terms of service. It is certainly not bad but just not really that good.The restaurant is in the IFC, very near the Four Seasons and supposedly one of the nicest spots in Central. Of course people do pay high prices but they should not expect any less in return. Alas, this is where the problem lies. Due to its location and that there are not too many other options for high class Japanese food the restaurant is perennially full. The staff, whilst not rude, are no different from what you find in 2 or 3 star places when this is supposed to be a 5 star restaurant (not Michelin star but think hotels). Here, instead of the staff paying attention to you, you have to pay attention to them. You will not have anyone coming over until you spend some time and effort to flag someone down. You have to chase after your food. We were at the teppanyaki table and our neighbours were only given the set lunch menu and never realized that a la carte existed...We decided to go for teppanyaki this time and ordered a set lunch each plus a la carte for more food and variety. First off, the salads came, one a sashimi salad, one a plain one. Nothing to write home about. They were fine, just fine. Not presented in an appetizing manner or style.0We had abalone and beef for teppanyaki. Prices have gone up but portion sizes for abalone have steadily gone down over the past 2 years. Teppanyaki, especially at high end restaurants, should involve at least some grace and finesse, if not ceremony. There was none. We ordered different kinds of beef. No one bothered to even let us know which was which (the guests were supposed to figure out from tasting them? It so happened that even after asking and being told which was Australian and which was Japanese, we felt they tasted the same which was a shame). The food tasted fine over, but again, nothing special.0After a couple of small dishes, to finish the meal, one of us was supposed to have tempura cake (our favourite whenever we visit Japan) with udon noodles. This is ONE item, just that the tempura cake, in order not to be soggy, was to be served separately, from the noodles. Separate they really were. The tempura cake came out and the waitress plopped it in front of us. When the noodles did not appear, we chased, and chased, and chased. After 15 minutes came the noodles by which time of course the tempura cake had gone cold. Should this have happened at any restaurant? any nice restaurant, much less a top Japanese restaurant? Any self-respecting tempura place / chef would have been dismayed at this. Not at this place. No one batted an eyelid when we explained many times, to different staff, that the tempura cake but not the noodles. As for the quality of the tempura here which we have tried many times, do not expect standards like you see in Tokyo. It is one of the better places in HK. That\'s it. The batter is not thin or light like that in top restaurants in Tokyo In fairness, it is not ultra thick either.00For my starch, I chose teppanyaki fried rice. After I had finished it, the waitress presented a plate of pickles! For those of you not familiar with Japanese pickles, they are supposed to accompany rice. Here, it is like serving pickles after a guest has finished his burger or sandwich.0For dessert, the waitress plopped a small square piece of chocolate cake in front of each of us, adorned slightly with raspberries and half a strawberry plus a blurp of cream. As I noticed that for one lunch dessert was stated to be ""dessert"" but for another it was stated to be ""dessert sampler"" I asked the waitress how come there was no sampler. She was totally non - plussed and said that was the only dessert they had. Anyway, I let it drop.0This is not a bad restaurant, nor was a terrible meal. For a thousand a head for lunch, it ought to be quite a bit better, even in expensive HK.'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-inagiku-japanese-restaurant/17460?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

We love ramen and have been participating in the ramen craze in New York City. First time using the automated ticket line machine...cool. For lunchtime on a Saturday, the speed was FAST. Although crowded everything went quick quick from the time we were seated to how fast our appetizers came. A mother son couple sat down after us and immediately ordered and their food came like in 5 minutes. Our waiter was super nice and suitably bi-lingual.The decor is nice and everything is kept very clean; the seating also emphasizes the fast ramen place this is. About half of the seating are tables and booths and the remaining half is counter and communal table. We sat at the communal table. It was nice that the seats each have a basket underneath them to put your purse/backpack. I love all the little condiments that come on the table: spicy cabbage pickle, fresh preserved ginger, a sesame seed grinder and peeled garlic cloves with a garlic press.The gyoza were OK; they definitely had that frozen then steam microwaved quality to the skin, and the filling was only so so, but they were served with alot of fresh green onions and ginger on top that gave it a fresher taste. We ordered the $88 Tokyo Ramen with Extra toppings ($68 without extra toppings). That came with 4 thick slices of pork, half an egg, bamboo shoots, three largish sheets of seaweed and a portion of spinach. The soup was good and the noodles had an al dente quality to them - tip: if you are sharing a ramen, order the Kamae-dae $15 for an extra portion of noodles. They give you a generous portion that works with the soup. Supplementary InformationKid's thumb up. They even have custom high chairs that match the cool decor!"", ""I asked the fellow diners whether they wanted Simply Life (which I was secretly vetting for) or Ippudo. All votes went to Ippudo. ._.

I was glad that the 'no-oil' option was available. If it isn't too cold there's no need for the layer of oil to keep the noodles warm.  The pork was very tender and fatty, but not as fatty as Nagahama's. The noodles were very thin and became quite soft near the end of the meal although I had ordered 'hard' noodles. Soy tonkotsuA more intensely-flavored broth0A more intensely-flavored brothThe soup base was much more intense and nicely flavoured than the classic soup. The noodles were also thicker, by default.

I completed the questionnaire and was this close to redeeming my free bun. But then the coupon expired. Boo."", 'One of my friends has been raving about this place. I thought that it was time to come here and give it a try. Noodles are one of my absolute favourite foods, so I was very much looking forward to this lunch. Lets just say that I was not disappointed. We were greeted by a nice waiter, who politely asked us how many of us were dining. We were then lead to our table and allowed to peruse the menu. The overall atmosphere of the place is very warm. There is sufficient lighting which is perfect for us reviewers to take good photos. I especially liked how the place felt very packed, yet spacious at the same time. Meaning that the restaurant was very full, and the place was operating at full capacity, but it does not feel cramped at all. We then proceeded to glance over the menu. the menu0the menuI think a menu plays a vital part to a restaurants success. I would give this menu special mention. First of all it has very good photos for all of its main noodle dishes. The layout is easy to follow, and the colour scheme is not distracting. Each item of food is accompanied with a well detailed account of the dish. This I believe is excellent because it really allows you to thoroughly decided what you want to eat. The descriptions are tailored to make you hungry and this is very good. They also offer a special seasonal menu, which also caught my eye in terms of its construction and appeal. After perusing the menu, we ordered our food. The waiter who took our order was very friendly and gave us additional comments about which dish he recommended. For example he explained to us that we could add an extra egg if we wanted at an additional cost. Moreover, he even explained that we could specify how we wanted our noodles to be cooked. They could be softer, normal, or even harder, which I thought was very thoughtful of him to provide us with these options to make our meal more pleasant.  We placed our orders and about 10 minutes later the first bowl of hot noodles arrived. The waiter announced the dish very quickly in a mumbled tone, and we did not comprehend what he was saying. He then repeated himself, but we still did not know which dish he was referring to. We then proceeded to open the menu and asked him to point to which one it was. He did, but as he placed the bowl down, he rolled his eyes. I thought that this was very unprofessional and immediately left me with a very sour impression of the restaurant. However, the smell of the noodles quickly changed my opinion. special akamaru shinaji0special akamaru shinajiThis was the most expensive noodle on the menu and rightly so. It comes with an egg that is raw on the inside, seaweed, sliced pork and spring onions. The dish was served piping hot, which is always a good sign. I wished that they shredded the seaweed so that I could have spread it throughout the soup. The egg was cooked beautifully and when I broke the egg white the yolk came streaming out in a never ending river of rich goodness. I ordered the noodles to be cooked normally and they were very tender and delicious. The meat was good and very lean. My friend thought the soup was very good, but personally I found the seasoning a bit overdone. It was very hot and full of flavour though. ippudo tonkotsu0ippudo tonkotsuThis was a more simple noodle. The noodles are very thin and it is served with lean slices of pork. My friend especially liked the fresh soybean sprouts and spring onions. She ordered the noodles to be cooked normally too, and found them to very smooth. The soup was hot and had less flavour than the previous dish. The amount of noodles is very filling. You can also order extra noodles at an additional costs if you are still hungry. hakata spicy tsukmen0hakata spicy tsukmenThis dish was the special dish of the month. It looked very appealing from the menu. This time the noodles were very thick. The were much more chewy than the other ones and had a nice texture to them too. There is a very heavy miso flavour to the soup that is served on the side. The noodles come with minced pork and a spicy sauce. My friend asked if they could not add the spicy sauce to the noodles directly, and they happily complied and put the sauce on the side in a separate bowl. The concept of this dish is that you mix a little bit of the soup and the spicy sauce with the noodles and minced pork to get a very special combination and flavour. The menu says ""Every delicious mouthful of the unique flavoured Spicy Tsukemen brings your taste buds a whole new experience that you\'ll never forget."" I would have to agree with this wholeheartedly. This dish is a must try, and my friend has already said she will come back for more and more. The only complaint was that the soup was not as hot as it should have been.Overall, a great lunch. The only disappointment was the very rude waiter. However, this was remedied by a very friendly waiter who kept checking on us, and asking how we were finding everything. We greatly appreciated this. Moreover, this waiter found my water bottle which I had accidentally left on the table and ran out to find me after I had left the restaurant. This is what I call good service. I was internally grateful. I will definitely be coming back very soon to try the many other noodle dishes this fine establishment has to offer. Supplementary InformationThis restaurant gets very busy from 12:00-13:30 as this is peak lunch hour rush in Admiralty. However, if you come before 11:50, you will definitely have a seat. I would suggest coming earlier (if you are not working) as the table wait time during lunch hour can be up to 45 minutes.', ""This is a great new choice for lunch in Admiralty. The only drawback is the crowds - waiting time can be up to 45 minutes even if you arrive early (e.g. on the dot at noon, which substantially decreases the waiting time at most other places). However, food is served super fast so you can finish your meal in less than 20-30 minutes.* Akamaru () Ramen $78 - The noodles here are perfectly cooked, even more so than I may say the TST branch where I am a regular. The soup is hearty without not being too oily or salty - extremely drinkable! It's extremely flavourful and well complemented by the condiments available including pickled ginger, grated roasted sesame seeds. The noodles also comes with two slices of rather fatty and tender pork which are also well seasoned. The portion of the pork I think is just right - more would be heart stopping * Soft-cooked egg () $10 - This is very well seasoned - my yolk was very slightly overcooked. The egg comes warm which is great. The one in TST comes cold so I have to leave it in the hot soup until pretty much I have nearly finished the noodles to warm it up.There are a number of other condiments you can add at additional cost, including Onsen Tamago ($10), pork neck, pork loin, roasted seaweed, etc. etc.Ambience is nice - not too noisy despite the crowds - and service is prompt and efficient, cheerful without being intrusive.All in all a good experience and I will be back.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/admiralty-ippudo-hk/109556?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw
309,Ippudo HK,Causeway Bay,Japanese,3.8,150.0,,"I have always loved Japanese ramen, but the problem for good ramen shop in Hong Kong is either the place is too small or it is not children friendly.Ippudo is a chain ramen shop that opened from Japan, they have many shops around the world and finally have opened one in Causeway Bay.  Since the restaurant is located inside Hysan Place the size of the shop is adequate, much larger than other ramen shop in the area.They serve a selection of ramen and side dishes.  They even have high chair available as well as a children menu.  This is definitely a plus, especially with a family.  We ordered two types of ramen, one is the original and the other one is the black ramen which has a black soup base and has a more generous sesame oil taste to it.  The side dishes were also great and my kids loved them.  Especially the fried corn and the Pork Bao. All and all the dishes were flavourful and ramen texture was firm but with a chew.  Soup was hot and has some collagen texture with 3 different types of condiments at your table for the ramen.The red bean and ice cream dessert was one of my boys favourite while the milk pudding was also great; had a hint of honey on top and milky pudding on the bottom.It was one satisfying lunch ! 0000100'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-ippudo-hk/540875?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

Due to time limit, my boyfriend and I only order a ramen and a roast pork rice to share. The ramen was okay, Id say a bit salty but I love how you can choose how cooked the ramen to be. You can also order an additional portion of ramen for $2 which seems to me a pretty good deal. The rice on the other hand is super delicious, portion is just right for me as a girl, the roast pork and onsen egg were also well cooked.

While waiting outside I already decided to have the Akamaru (was attracted by the black seasame oil) so when the waitress took my order as soon as I got a seat. Was asked to choose between think or thin noodles (chose thin), and soft/normal/hard (chose normal). The noodles arrived not long after and it looked and smelled good! Quickly tried the first scoop of soup - rich and tasty as expected . Then experimented with the self serve additional ingredients (added red ginger, garlic and preserved vegetables). It was only afterwards that I found the garlic press - so had to take out the garlic again to grate it . Finally it was time to dive into the noodles, which were soft but still chewy and balanced well with the soup and toppings. The meat was ok - definitely not the main attraction.The size was just right for a light lunch. I was getting quite thristy after finishing the whole bowl of soup, so the free iced water definitely helped!

Also, I liked the design of the ceiling, which reminded me of some beautiful paper art. It got a little noisy later when the restaurant started to fill up. However, the whole ambiance continued to be relaxing.  0Taste & Value:Bread Basket There were a total of 4 different types of bread that were all deliciously warm and fresh.I especially liked the herby focaccia and bread crackers.

You just knew it would be good without tasting it.  This was refreshing to eat, as everything was so fresh.

A lot but ordinary. She had the mushroom risotto for main course. A bit bland and the rice was undercooked.I had the minestrone soup. The vegetables were cooked but the soup was bland. I then had the veal for the main course. Half of it was soft and tender while the rest was dry, so I left it. There was also a sliver of sauce, I'm guessing some kind of gravy, but it was too little for the amount of meat. The roasted pumpkin was soft and tasty.The dessert was plentiful but either bland (brownie, cheesecake), tough (mini profiteroles) or too strong (tiramisu's alcohol).

Wish there were more cheese selections and perhaps some crackers to go with.One thing to note - the bread basket could be better. A bit stale and cold. For main course I had the mushroom and thyme tagiatelle. Not bad but nothing spectacular. The desserts are better than I expected!

The Bangkok originated restaurant has opened Hong Kong\'s first branch in Causeway Bay, offering Hong Kong customers a true experience to modern Thai cuisine with authentic and traditional taste.As ISSAYA is an old Thai word meaning rainy season, the restaurant is decorated with lots of plants, green and wooden colours. Most of the furniture and utensils are shipped directly from Thailand to bring you to a Thailand trip in every way. ISSAYA is one of hkblogger\'s most anticipated restaurants to try in 2015.

The tuna fish was so fresh that it became gelatin-ey, while the combination of the freshly ""pounded"" seasoning using mortar was just right which brought out the whole flavour from the delicate fish. p.s. do you think the special wooden container looks a bit like a gardening plow? Though it was a bit of a big bite, we would highly recommend you to have it in one go so that all the flavours from the chili, ginger and the crispy shell can be bonded to create the so-called mouth-gasm.

The baby eggplants were my favourite as it bursted out from my mouth once I bit into it. The texture was just like salmon roe, or chicken balls if you know what I mean.

Kanom Dok Mali ($85)Jasmine flower panna cotta served with jasmine rice ice cream and jasmine rice tuile. A few things I loved from our first dessert. Not exaggerating but the panna cotta was one of the smoothest I have ever had. The jasmine flavour was like a floral perfume injection to the panna cotta. Meanwhile, I also loved how the tuile stayed very crunchy after sitting for a while, making it a perfect light dessert to pamper yourself.

The good structure of it provides a define taste of each layer and we particularly liked how they use the crispy jasmine rice puff to make the contrast texture. Last but not least, we had to try some of their signature macarons including the Thai milk tea flavour as well as the salted duck egg flavour. Both flavours have what a macaron should be without overly sweetened. Don\'t be afraid to try the duck egg flavour because it just had a hint of savoriness. Sneak Peak: there might be a dessert counter for take-away coming soon for you to cure your sweet tooth! Thai milk tea & salted duck egg macaron0Thai milk tea & salted duck egg macaron You might be surprised that there were no typical dishes like Pad Thai or Tom Yum Goong, it is because the restaurant would like to deliver the authentic taste without using all common dishes in any restaurants in Hong Kong. We really appreciate how chef Ian brought us to a journey of unique flavours and food texture, giving us lots of history background with new inspiration and attitude towards food. We highly recommend you to come and treat yourself a short trip to Bangkok. ISSAYA also serves set lunch, and green menu partnering with Green Monday.

I was really looking forward to having a great meal there. But despite securing a booking way before our trip, we ended up failing to locate the famed restaurant even with the help of a GPS. So when I heard about this 39th rank restaurant in Asia (according to the 2015 Asia Best 50 Restaurants award by San Pellegrino) opening in Hong Kong this month, I decided to jump all over it.Perched on the 25th floor of the Soundwill Plaza II (Midtown), it was natural to expect some sort of harbour view from this new establishment but what I didn\'t realize was that the new building directly opposite to Soundwill Plaza II (I think it\'s called V-Point) has already finished its development and it\'s completely blocking the view!OK, so no view from the window but I must say, I have been very impressed with the dcor of this 150-seater the moment I stepped through the doors. 1 0This place also features 2 private rooms and an outdoor terrace. There was no view from the private room neither but love the fact that it\'s so bright and airy.private room0private roomIan Kittichai, chef and co-founder of Issaya, was also on hand (in white shirt, sitting at the sofa) during the opening week to train up the local team ahead of the grand opening.0I started things off with a glass of Thai iced milk tea but surprisingly it was not nearly sweet enough (one at Greyhound tasted slightly better).Thai iced milk tea0Thai iced milk teaWe decided to explore the set as well as a la carte menu here.

Very refreshing start!0Another starter from the set menu was the slow cooked duck leg, with tropical fruit and roasted cashew nuts in long red chili pepper dressing.

Saw this place on open rice and it is a recommended place by Michelin. Decided to give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised by the inexpensive pricing for lunch set and the quality. Most of the sushis are seasoned with interesting twist. The tuna roll with fried onions was yummy!000000000000', 'Finally , sorting out a lunch date with an old good friend of mine, we love good food and drinks and probably food helped us to bring up a lot of topics for chit chat, she doesnt do blogging but she is also a true foodie, and I really love to hang out with her  I have been bugging her to take me to the sushi place and we manage to meet up today in Iwanami Japanese, pretty much right outside CWB Sogo MTR Exit. We had our sushi set (12 pcs omakase) plus Albino. 0To begin with our meal, the steamed egg, salad were served, they had a full house so we will have to eat these before we got escort to the bar counter. All up to standard, and the steam egg was sooooooo smooth. I am not going to go into details to describe every piece of those sushi, I think the photo will tel you the truth. 1Flounder, since they have a big flounder family, my guess could be a karei? 1The Sayori one is our second piece, one of the best Sayori I have had, so refreshing!2 Buri came right next to the Sayori piece! I have to say, this buri made my day, soft with an optimal amount of oil, pretty much melt in my mouth! 1Meguro soaked in soy sauce Kinme Dai! One of my friends fav!!! 1Both of us were a huge fan of Albino, chef Ricky said that they are in superb quality today, so we had to do one bowl each. Served in a light soy sauce rather than the citrus, is still really good but the citrus could help wash away the greasiness, still, it is in superb quality! 11Half way through we had miso0Grill toro with tempura spring onion , a very interesting combo, good to explore this new stuff!1No sake today,but chef ricky offered us an additional snack 1Ika with uni, a very old school combo, but it was good! 1The aka gai was really fresh too! Remind me of the old good times in the market! 1Kohada marinated in vinegar 1Aka-abi with sakura ebi 1Mini uni rice 1Mince toro hand roll with tempura onion to end our meal 1To choose between coffee or ice cream, we went for coffee icecream, they had coffee jelly in there and impressed me completely! 1Often lots of people said good sashimi can make good sushi? It is very important to know how to play around to match up the correct ingredient and craft a piece of sushi, coming back will be a must, jst gotta work out the best time to come back with my friend, together with some sake.1'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-iwanami-japanese-restaurant/19033?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
318,Izumi Curry,Central,Japanese,4.3,80.0,,"I'm excited to have another Japanese curry shop added to my list of weekday lunch options. Getting up the building during lunch hour was always a hassle though, and I waited for 5 min under the rain for the lift. We arrived the restaurant at around 1220pm and still managed to get a table, not sure if that's an indication or what though.They've got a lunch menu and almost everything they serve was a curry dish. There's 5% discount if you pay and leave by 1245pm which obviously, could not be the case for us. All the sets came with a salad and a drink, and I thought the price was pretty reasonable. 0The salad was fresh with Japanese sesame dressing. 0The presentation of the food was very Japanesey - neat, tidy and clean - upon serving you can be sure that there'd be no curry dripping on the sides of the plates or chunks of rice floating about in various directions on the sauce. The hamburg steak omlette curry rice I ordered came with a scrambled egg. The chef must've used a lot of butter into making it though cuz it was indeed really tasty (how evil!). The hamburg steak was cooked just right to medium well so I could still taste that juicy and tender texture. Along with the curry sauce and rice I was no doubt going to skip dinner that day.omlette0omletteMy gfs ordered beef omlette curry rice and tonkatsu sweet curry rice. I thought the original curry tasted better though. The sweet curry was a little...hard to explain. Try for yourself if you feel like being adventurous. I didn't try the tonkatsu but it looked really good, and I'm sure it tasted good as well since my friend finished the entire plate. It was the last thing to arrive though, and my friend waited for about 20 min for it.omlette0omlette0Pretty good food at that price at that location.

A girl came immediately to help as the cashier. I could see there were 3 staffs in the small restaurant, a girl and two boys, ALL good-looking lol.I ordered french fries set and got to pick a type of 6-inch hot dog and soft drink. I picked the hot dog with tomato and hot dog sausage. The french fries were warm and soft, offering a nice texture but lacking the taste. The tomatos were quite good but the bread and the sausage was too plain. You feel that if only there is one thing that they put into more efforts and thought, you would have a pleasant surprise. But fact is, the sauce, the bread, the sausage, were all just so-so, as if you are buying a random piece of bread and sausage from the convenient store.I didn't try their seemingly famous over-sized hot dog, nor other recommendations.

Only 2 types of green salad with a few dressing to choose from.  There were a couple more small dishes, that's all.The next table was the juicy bar.  4 or 5 juices to choose from.  I was wondering was this breakfast buffet or lunch buffet?The seafood table had half lobsters, prawns and clams.  They looked great but unfortunately they didn't taste great.  Lobster meat was very tough and I ended up only finishing half of it.The good thing that this buffet also had a menu sheet which you could order other small dishes such as appetizer, seafood, meat, pasta, sushi and sashimi. They were supposedly made to order.  The fish or seafood from the sushi and sashimi were of low quality and i seriously doubt that they were made to order and they were on my table 2 mins after I placed the order.  The lobster pasta was bland, only 1 small piece of overcooked lobster on the plate.The food was only so so and I do not believe I was given food worth $495.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/admiralty-jws-california/1509?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

Mr. C enjoyed it, but i personally find it a bit too dry. Supposedly there's cheese stuffing in the ravioli, but i find there's only a very thin layer of cheese inside.

We asked for some freshly grinded parmesan cheese. Yum~What i saw at the restaurant during this lunch hour was that we and another table were the only two tables without kids.

We were given two cans of tomatoes to hold the wooden planks for presentation. The raised position added some fun and made the dish looked gluttonous. Well, we were amazed by some of the petite portions, such as the beetroot-cured salmon on a bed of ice. The salmon piece looked like a helpless fallen leave but its for two people! We each had one shellfish, clam and mussel. To be fair the seafood was flavourful, but were left graving for more. The pecorino was very strong to me balanced by chilli jam. The smoked mackerel pate and pickles were really salty. We enjoyed the crunchy carrot and beet salad with lemon and mint though.

It wasn't the sauce that was watery (the sauce is just cream) but I do not think they drained the pasta properly when they boiled it as it was actually water. How can they even serve something that bad.The sausage parpadelle was average - wasn't great but better than the other dish. Seriously no joke, Spaghetti House has better pasta than this place and of coure spaghetti house is only average quality. We also got the crab and avocado bruschetta which was good but expensive for the tiny pieces of crab you get on it.I would rate this probably the worst restaurant I have ever been to in Hong Kong and the worst value for money as the two of us spent $HKD500 here.Ill never be back."", ""We were a bunch of 3 , out for a Christmas lunch.Jamie's Italian is a lovely , large place , but with warm interiors.

Oh, ok. They were actually for holding up the fish and cured meat planks. The taste of the nibbles, however, were not as impressive as they were displayed.Fish and cured meat planks0Fish and cured meat planksSo, what\'s up with the malnourished midget mussel?Malnourished midget mussel1Malnourished midget musselAfter clearing the nibbles we still had two orders of small pasta which we had been waiting over an hour and a half for. I had to followup with the waiter twice before they arrived at 140pm, 20 to gotta-be-back-at-desk. I quickly had a quickie on the tagliatelle bolognese and squid-ink speghetti before hopping out of the couch to leave. The squid-ink speghetti was done al-dente and the scallop tasted fresh except it was a little bit too salty. The tagliatelle bolognese looked pretty cute (or no?) - like some curled up pig / cow intestines you get from local Chinese joint. Now, this was slightly overcooked and got a little soggy.Tagliatelle bolognese0Tagliatelle bologneseSquid-ink speghetti0Squid-ink speghettiComplimentary service charge was not included in the bill, and the total came to $660 for 3 people. I would say this is pretty reasonably priced but quite overrated as usual especially with the huge, crazy line-up\'s. To be fair I wasn\'t having very high expectations though having tried a few Jamie restaurants in London. It\'s just his usual style - simple, casual dining at reasonable price.

Since then it has grown to more than 30 restaurants worldwide, and there are already plans for even more in towns, counties and countries around the world.True to Form & Hype Jamie's Italian was open to a media & fans frenzyHow the Experience WentNot being able to book on the website (Fully Booked until Mid-September) or by phone (No One Picks Up or Returns Voice Messages) the only other way was to walk-in & wait.Arrived around 1:00 pm on a Sunday afternoon, I was immediately told a minimum waiting time of 90 min.During the 90+min wait they brought (3 times) out a selection of Charcuteries (Cold Cuts) & Bread for patrons to sample. Unfortunately the items past around were so dry from being left out on the counter under Air-conditioning it was rather unappealing. Furthermore no toothpicks or napkins was provided so the poor person at the very end of the line was collection the rows of people in front of them saliva.While waiting many patrons left from the line or when told that it would be a minimum of 90 mins wait. By my count over 40+, what was more disappointing was that several older generation patrons (Grandmothers) asked if they could book but was only told to go check out the website & book through that wayIm not sure if they would be able to navigate the web without help from someone?Finally arrive @ the front of the line only to be told that only High Tables would be available & if I wanted a seated table I would have to wait an additional 15-20 min. The host seemed frustrated & agitated due to my rejection.10 mins later we were escorted to the table & were promptly seated right in front of the action (Open Kitchen)within seconds our waiter was already welcoming us & presenting the menus, so eager that he was already telling us about the restaurants signature dishes.The place was buzzing with activity & smells wafting from the kitchen only heightened the anticipation of the meal to come.After perusing the menu we selected the followingStarters-Cauliflower & Cheese Fritters with Fiery Arrabiata Dip- Cauliflower was par boiled & the cheese crust was soggy, while the Arrabiata was Not Fiery or seasoned, tomatoes & garlic dominated the sauce. The crispy sage leaves were a nice touch.Italian Spiced Chicken Wings with Smoked & Spicy Tomato Sauce- Again the Chicken Wings was precooked first & finished off with the tomato sauce topped with spring onions. The chicken wings were tender but bland & the Spicy sauce was Not Spicy and acidic.Pasta-Sausage Pappardelle Braised Fennel Sausage Ragu with Incredible Chianti, Parmesan & Pangrattato (Main Course Size) - The fresh pasta was shaped into long waves but over-cooked (Mushy) with a generous topping of sausage ragu which was again bland & not seasoned not even the pangrattato could save this dish.Mains-Lamb Lollipops- Chops Grilled Under a Brick with Herby Red Onions Salad, Roasted Nuts, Yoghurt for Dunking & Polenta Chips- They never asked about the Lambs Temperature but when it arrived it was Medium Well, the condiments was all solid & well presented on a plank of Wood propped up by 2 tomato cans. Exactly like Jamie had cooked for his 30 Minute Meals. The Polenta Chipsmore like Cubes was crispy & soft on the inside.Sides-Chargrilled Aubergine with Sicilian Caponata Dressing- the Aubergine had no char while the sweet & sour Caponata was well balanced but it would have helped if we were informed that this side was served cold.Over all the meal was disappointing with food not seasoned properly & items being at best warm. Not living up to the menu description was a major fault.Everything in our body wanted this meal to be fantastic despite the 90+min wait but in the end the food & Hype didnt deliver.In a city full of Just OK Food this restaurant will tick over due to Jamies notorietyIm sure with time these issues will be ironed out.In the meantime if youre prepared to wait & want to experience Jamies Italian for yourself, do give it a go.Total Bill for 2 persons @ $600 HKD (No Service Charge)Bon Appetito!"", 'During the queueing , staff was nice enough to provide free appetizers. very basic charcuterie and foccacia with balsamic. the bread was too chewy, not moist, which seems not fresh at all and should have tipped us off.Finally we made it, after 2.5 hours of wait for lunch. Starter was crab avocado bruschetta.Very small for that price, the avocado is some cream on the side and it was also served with some cream cheese. The bread of the bruschetta was awful. Too hard, cold, and chewy. Tasted like it was toasted a week ago. The bruschetta itself didn\'t taste much, and the creams on the side were awkward.Also bruschetta should traditionally is a warm starter, here it was cold.Second we had pasta.Tagliatelles Bolognese: pasta was ok, sauce was quite on the oily side. Sauce really tasted the same as the barilla canned Bolognese I had when I was a university student. not what I expected.Crab spaghettini: no seasoning other than parsilly , very bland. There was not as much crab as we would expect for the price. The parsilly hid the taste of the crab. the plate was served cold. worse: there was bits of crab shell in the dish. when we told the waiter he didn\'t seem to think it was a problem at all.Prawn linguine: prawn looked more like small shrimps, sauce too liquid and sour, the seasoning definitely felt plain again. pasta was al dente though.What a waste...We were very excited to try this place. Concerning booking: staff seems to make sure a max people line up. We first tried booking and on the phone were told that reservations were full but we could walk in ""anytime"". We tried walk in Friday night and saw the wait was 4hours... Staff than told us to come the next day for lunch, there would be no wait especially if we came before noon. We did, there was a queue, they told us we would wait 1hr, turns out we waited 2 and a half hours.quite disappointed, such a long wait for such a plain food. definitely not worth it.crab bruschetta, the bread was a joke0crab bruschetta, the bread was a jokeprawn linguine0prawn linguinecrab spaghettini , plain, no seasoning0crab spaghettini , plain, no seasoning0', ""Friday afternoon , after a busy morning ,decided to treat ourselves with a better lunch.Although we were so hungry, still we waited for around 90 mins in order to dine in .0Finally, it's our turn!

Maybe because of the flavorful starters, this dish became somewhat blend. The fresh made pasta itself was good, chewy and rich. But the sauce was a bit too runny for me. The cherry tomatoes were very sweet. The prawns were slightly overcooked, hence the heavy shrinking in size. When I ordered this dish, the waitress warned that the pasta would be a bit spicy. It was very kind of her, but spiciness was the furthest flavor I could taste. A disappointment.Burger Italiano - Form over function?0Burger Italiano - Form over function?And then there was the Burger Italiano. It was so big you have to deconstruct it to eat it. The buns were great, soft and buttery, and not soggy at all. The fried onions on the second layer were really good, crispy and full of flavors. The small pieces of bacon were absolutely delightful, very thin, almost pork-sheets-thin. But the main event, the patty, was a downfall. It was too well done, dry and tough. There was zero fat in it and no other stuff was mixed into it, which many burgers do. It\'s such a shame. It could have been an awesome burger. I particularly like the fact that there was no sauce in the burger. Most burger sauce has the sole function of greasing up the dish. For the chips, there were a few options, I chose the one with fresh garlic and parsley. Again, it had the potential of being a great chips. But there was a fatal mistake on the presentation. The chips served in a cup means that all the lovely chunks of slightly raw garlic all slipped down to the bottom. So those on top were very blend when the great flavors got flushed down. Such a shame.Pavlova - Thing of beauty0Pavlova - Thing of beautyAfter two slight misses, the desert was a chance of Jamie\'s Italian to redeem itself. And it did. The Pavlova, served with limoncello-soaked berries and a generous portion of citrusy sauce. The limoncello definitely did the magic. Its sour note greatly balanced the sweet meringue. The meringue itself was not soggy at all, and crumbling.As Jamie said in an SCMP interview, this restaurant aims at the least-tapped mid-market in Hong Kong, and it did just that. It gives Hong Kong foodies an affordable chance to taste casual Italian cuisine, and of course to make a pilgrimage to the celebrity chef. It was not a perfect meal, but it\'s still PLATE-LICKING GOOD. Looking forward to trying other dishes on the big menu.', ""As expected, I came to Jamie's Italian with more than high expectations. Jamie is a world renowned chef opening a restaurant in the food heaven of Hong Kong. I thus had a fantasy of how great the food may be.00I got there early for lunchtime and thus there was little to no lineup. We started with the fish appetizer platter, which was very delicious. The tuna was fresh, so were the fish fillets and shellfish. The garlic mayo dip was very flavorful and it was obvious fresh ingredients were used.Fish appetizer platter0Fish appetizer platterThe main courses however, left much more to be coveted. One thing to note was that both the mains and appetizer came out at the same time, which was a byproduct of slow production the previous 2 days, as explained by our host. The squid ink pasta was salty, and the pasta rough and coarse. It tasted more like Japanese soba noodles than pasta. The aubergine parmasiana had good texture with the eggplant and mozzarella, but could do with more layered seasoning both in the sauce as well as in the vegetables themselves.While I did not have the very best experience I had envisioned in my mind, it was still a delightful time. Very cheery, energetic hosts helped a lot. Since this was just the 3rd day of opening, I will give Jamie's Italian a benefit of the doubt.Squid ink pasta0Squid ink pastaMenu2Menu"", ""I walked by today for lunch and saw that this was open! Do you know how long I've been waiting for this opening? If you ask my friends, they'll say forever. I was so excited, I didn't even wait for anyone to eat with me so went in by myself!I've been to Jamie Oliver's in London, both Fifteen and Jamie's Italian. The place seemed to have the same look and feel of his London restaurants. I hoped the food was the same!The actual entrance is in Midtown but has it's own entrance. There is a small gift shop to buy all things Jamie, like his cookbooks, napkins and yes ... olive oil! There is a escalator to go up to the actual restaurant on the second floor.0Entering the restaurant, it was brightlhy light by the windows. Spacious and comfortable yet chic decor. I was greeted by the hostess who told me that it was pretty full but they did have a seat at the bar for me. She explained it was an excellent spot to see the staff slicing away and I said it was perfect. So, I sat at the bar area.0I was given a menu and introduced to my waiter who would serve me the entire time. I noticed the prices weren't very expensive! And noted that there was no service charge (except for table of 10 or more) and I was to tip the waiter accordingly. What a breath of fresh air because that is how I used to eat in Canada .... tip the waiter, no added forced service charge! And I think this made a difference because the waiter was super friendly, checking in on me every so often to make sure everything was fine. Working for tips does make a difference in service! My waiter also spoke fluent American accented English!menu0menuA photo of the napkins. I noted that they sold this at the gift shop downstairs.0The view from my bar which had hanging cured meats.

Wonderful with the heat outside. I ordered a Limonata and was given a glass filled with chunks of ice which was great as it kept the drink cold throughout my lunch.0I started with a cured meat plank. I asked the waiter how large it was and he informed me that it is charged per person so it will be enough for exactly one. When it arrived it was placed on two cans of tomato and the waiter expertly recited what was on the plank of wood. The selection of meats were nice. And the carrot and beetroot salad was crunchy and fresh. My favorite was percorino and chili jam! I remember having this at his place in London and the mix of cheese and something sweet was tastebud blowing! The olives were pretty good. This is definitely something good with a glass of wine!meat platter0meat plattermeat platter0meat platterI ordered what I had at his Fifteen restaurant. Garlic fried prawn linguine. Small portion as I don't eat that much. Portion size was ok. It was topped with fresh rocket lettuce, giving it color. The prawns were smaller than in London but I think it's due to the fact they are using local produce and it's probably smaller? Needless to say, there were quite a lot of shrimp. The pasta, handmade daily, was perfectly al dente. Sauce was wonderful. Tomato with a touch of chili spice. Just like how Jamie likes to cook it as he does in all his cooking shows. I watch his shows endlessly and even attempted this pasta once to great success! There was also a lot of sauce and could have been mopped up with bread which there was none of unless you ordered it. Sadly, they charge you for bread here where in his London restaurants, I was given a whole loaf and I remember it was the best bread I've had in a long time.garlic fried shrimp pasta0garlic fried shrimp pastaService was friendly.

Japanese Wagyu Yakiniku Pure is located inside Henry House, a building with several more high end Japanese restaurants. This place specializes in yakiniku ... Japanese style bbq.Lunch sets range from $98 - 250. Menu is in English and Chinese with photos. As I was here for yakiniku, I orderd the premium karubi set for $220. Lunch sets come with coffee or tea, salad, appetizer and miso soup.I was given a table at the bar but I noticed it was pretty quiet compared to the other restaurants in the building. Each seat has a bbq grill but it is fairly spacious. I noticed it was stuffy and not enough air conditioning. This was even more noticable once the grill was lit and I sat, sweating away as I grilled my meal.Salad. Salad was drenched in salad dressing. There was so much of it, it made everything soggy.0Appetizer. Daily appetizer was a beef slices with cucumber in sesame sauce. Again there was so much dressing, it was sitting in sauce. This made everything overly salty.0Premium Karubi Set. Karubi set came with a decent portion of meat (a total of eight slices of wagyu beef), a small piece of corn, one shitake mushroom and two slices of Japanese pumpkin. The beef was fairly decent quality and the sides were alright. The corn and pumpkin were very sweet.0Miso soup was included and tasted a bit too watery.Though the beef was good, the sides were much to be desired. What annoyed me was that everything was served at once like some fast food chain. Placement of the food was always annoyingly placed SUPER far from me so I had to drag everything closer. Combined with the lack of air conditioning, this made for a very unpleasant lunch experience. I doubt I'd return again and I now understand why it was so quiet at lunch hour.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-japanese-wagyu-yakiniku-pure/125244?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

How can I not return to this place? I visited this place when it first opened and liked it enough though I thought it was a bit expensive for what I paid for so didn't return. But Hello Kitty brings me back! I love a character pop-up restaurant.They decorated the entire place with Hello Kitty pictures. I thought it was pretty well done. The tables, the walls, EVERYTHING!00000The special Hello Kitty menu is in English and Chinese. There is no 10% service charge. You order by writing on the menu with a marker.2Hello Kitty Ice Fruit Tea ($98). I remember when I first saw this item mentioned in a magazine, it didn't cost this much. But I wasn't sure so checked back later when I went home to write this. Yes, they did increase prices. When it first started, it was $58 and you add money if you want to keep the glass. But now they just included into the price and force you to take it home. At least the glass is cute but I don't know why they force you to keep it now by increasing the price of the drink. Even boyfriend was appalled when he heard how expensive this drink was when I told him. He even asked if there was any alcohol because there is no way a fruit tea can be that expensive without booze. But no...there is no alcohol. It was good though. There was a Hello Kitty shaped apple slice. Slices of orange and lemon was stuck together with a toothpick. The straw had a Hello Kitty piece of paper on it. Inside the tea there were slices of watermelon, kiwi and banana. Yes, the addition of the banana was definitely odd as it was just got all mushy. The drink was pretty good. Sweet with the taste of fruit. Only odd one out was the banana bits. They will clean the cup for you when you are finished.0Hello Kitty Braised Beef Gnocchi ($128). I decided on this noodle as it had slices of noodles shaped like Hello Kitty. There is no actual purpose of serving it on the side other than for photo taking. I ended up tossing all the slices of noodle into my bowl of soup. The soup was pretty good. Strong and rich. There were a few bits of beef. Not a lot but at least very moist and tender. That was about it. The slices of noodle were good. Al dente and smooth.0I always thought this place was a bit too expensive for what they offer but now with the Hello Kitty crossover, it's even more expensive. So expensive, I don't think I'll be back to try something else before it ends. That is probably why the place was fairly quiet. There were no repeat Hello Kitty customers. The good thing about this is that they did put a lot of thought into the items and the decoration of the entire restaurant. I've been to far too many crossovers where it's lazily slapped together. This wasn't so. I guess if you are a Hello Kitty fan, definitely go. If not, skip it. It's far too expensive."", ""The noodles here are delicious! They are cooked to perfection. Soft but with a springy bounce to them. The beef is tender and melts in your mouth. Some dishes even come with greens, so you get your veggies intake. It's a small dining room, but the environment is open and bright and very clean. Service is very quick. The only thing is that it's a bit pricey - $95 for a bowl of their signature beef noodle soup. $78 for other types of noodle soups and dry noodles. Also, they don't give you water for free. You have to buy it for $14. Not a place to eat at every day, but definitely worth treating yourself every once in a while.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-jiu-wu-beef-noodle/567139?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

329,John Anthony,Causeway Bay,Chinese,3.7,400.0,0.0,"John Anthony is tucked underneath the brand new Lee Garden Three with something of a colonial-style setting--a strange mixture of cultures with elements of East and West. The setting reminds me even of Moorish architecture. Experience-wise, one could expect a light-hearted version of Central\'s Mott 32. The menu offers a fresh take on classic Chinese (mainly Cantonese and Szechuanese) with an extravagant touch. Food is pretty tasty and comes in small portions. Hosting staff try to come off as professional, but in our four or five visits to John Anthony since its opening, our view that service is generally bumpy, rigid, and unwelcoming has not changed. Staff seems to have clearly defined duties and a server who takes dishes may not be allowed to take orders, and a server not responsible for your table may have to redirect the ""right"" person to come over; special requests for the kitchen will be downright rejected.One might also wonder why the restaurant is named so. John Anthony was a Chinese native and interpreter stationed in London\'s Chinatown and was apparently instrumental in facilitating global trade during the Qing Dynasty in the thirty or so years during which he acted as a caretaker for trade sailors who had journeyed to the Far East. I presume his name was chosen to commemorate the part he took in enabling mutual understanding and cooperation between communities in the East and West. And so, diners are invited to splurge at his namesake restaurant on dishes that celebrate the fruits of globalization.Food Rundown0Cold appetizer: Homemade tofu, black truffle, $115This chilled appetizer is a great way to start.

There\'s a bed of potato noodles sitting beneath the fish that was also very nice. Only complaint was that the dish was slightly too oily.0Fish maw, napa cabbage, fish broth, $240A simple yet comforting dish.

The lean meat was hard, and the peripheral of each piece was full of dark char. The taste is on the sweet side, which I guess is the taste of honey.

We arrived at about 2:30pm so there was no wait but the place was packed!! The food was hot, inexpensive, and served quickly. All 3 of us decided on bbq pork with rice. The BBQ pork was juicy and tender and the portion just right. Their ""secret"" sauce was delicious and my one daughter was stealing rice from my plate to enjoy more because she loved the rice with their sauce.I would say the portion size for $24 was just perfect for lunch. For dinner, might want a bigger portion, but perfect for midday.We decided to take an order of chicken wings to go home with us, and they were honey garlic and delicious. Not too sweet and lots of garlicy taste. In spite of carrying them home, they were still hot and very good. We will also return to buy those for takeaway. I had been a bit worried about my ability to be served in English here, but no problems at all. Although the pace was fast, I found the servers more than willing to help me out.We will definitely return.Supplementary InformationTheir chicken wings are really good too!', ""Perhaps BBQ pork isn't their specialty.

Much more palatable. The lean BBQ pork(you can make a request for that) was far too oily and fatty for me. It feels as if you're eating a lump of fat. In terms of texture, the fatty bits were of course - oily, but the rest of the meat was quite tender. In terms of flavour, the entire portion I had was bland (as if it weren't salted), the surface was far too sweet (too liberal an application of honey glaze?).

Delivered by Food Panda, which was very on time. Price was $74 delivered. Not worthwhile at all.M&S Tuna Nicoise may be prepacked but tastes a lot better.

(Queue goes way out the door during lunch time, it's Central afterall). Staff are friendly and lots of toppings to choose from and they all seem fresh.The only thing I can complain about is the price. Cheapest would be $52 create your own. Wrap is $45 I think."", ""I used to be a fan of Dressed salad until I tried this place.  Although Dressed is more convenient for me, the quality of the food at Just really makes the longer walk worthwhile.   I was so happy when I heard about their new store in World-wide House cos I no longer have to walk all the way up the escalator in the heat Anyway, I felt like having something light today after a few big meals over the weekend, so I ordered my usual 'Custom salad' - 1 green + 4 toppings (2 more toppings if you bring your own Just salad bowl) for $49 Green: Mesclun + Romaine (You can always mix the greens) Toppings:  Asparagus, Beets, Egg whites, White Mushrooms, Artichoke Hearts, Cherry tomatoes and Tuna (extra $10) Dressing: Honey DijonIt was as good as expected.  The only thing I didn't like was the artichoke hearts, they didn't cut the outer layers properly, which made it v hard to chew.   For you meat-lovers and those who want more carb, they actually have a wide range of toppings for you to choose from.  And to be honest, $49 for a salad is a pretty good deal (esp. in Central).  I'd like to do a little comparison on the 2 competitors:Price & toppings Dressed: $58 for 1 Green + 4 Toppings; $48 for salad sandwiches wrapped in grilled flatbread; $35 for a bowl of soup ($25 with salad)  Just:  $49 for 1 Green + 4 Toppings (2 extra if you bring your own bowl); $45 for salad wraps (with a choice of Plain, Spinach, Basil Tomato & Whole wheat); $18 for a bowl of soupDressed is obvoiusly more expensive. I don't mind paying for the price if only the service and food quality are better as it is at a more convenient location.  They might have similar amount of toppings to choose from (around 70+), but you'll need to add extra $$ for quite a few of them.  (e.g. Artichoke hearts for an extra $4, Egg whites for an extra $8, Tofu for another $4 - why!? )  I've also noticed people at Dressed are quite stingy on the portions of toppings they give you, (It is probably because of their high rent )  whereas they really fill your bowl with toppings at Just!  I like how their greens (at Just) are so fresh they won't 'shrink' after being tossed with dressing.  I remember my bowl of Dressed salad sank so low it became half-full (or half empty if you like )I personally didn't like the asparagus at Dressed cos they were grilled, and tasted quite burnt.  The same applies to their grilled flatbread which comes with the salad.  It depends on your own tastes really.  I prefer the fresh piece of wheat bread that comes with the bowl of Just salad I won't comment on the soups at either restaurants cos they weren't very impressive, but again it's cheaper at Just.DressingsI love how Just salad catagorized their dressings into 5 different types:  Just salad originals, Just salad classics, Low fat, Fat free & Asian delight.  They also tell you whether that particular dressing is suitable for people with different diets.  Other than that, the types of dressings are quite different at the two restaurants, so it's rather difficult to comment on.Choices of designed saladsThe selections of designed salads are also quite different between the two.  Dressed salad have special promotions from time to time and their Japanese Lobster Salad was very nice.  They have a more 'traditional' selections - Caesar, Falafel, California, Cobb, Vegetable garden, The Club etc.Just also have Caesar and California, but their list of designed salads are not as 'commonly-known'.  So it really depends on your own liking.ServiceService at Just is definitely better.  They're a lot friendlier, more patient etc.. and at least the first thing they give you is a smile, not a cold 'What would you like'.  That, I might be biased, but I'm only speaking from experience. ** I love how the management of Just salad is aware of its corporate social responsibility and promotes environmental consciousness.  I can only say so much... so it's always best to see for yourselves!!

Coincidentally both are of American creation. DRESSED, now opened in IFC, and now, JUST SALAD along Cochrane Street. With a catchy grassy greenness throughout, JUST SALAD is a New York native. Nick Kenner and Rob Crespi, the owners of JUST SALAD, paired up with chef Laura Pensiero to develop its menu, with mix-and-match salad ingredients custom made in front of the customers. Introduced now to Hong Kong-ers, JUST SALAD is determined for HK-ers to create our own customized salads.The spot is of convenience, right by the corner of Cochrane Street and Lyndhurst Terrace, JUST SALAD occupied a two-storey space where the ground floor was nothing more than a salad counter and some space (for lining up, perhaps?!). Ordering is easy here. All you need is the staff walking you through the menu. You\'ll first choose a greens base (among Romaine, Mesclun, Iceberg and arugula), then you get to choose 4 other toppings for your salad. You will have no trouble going through the list. It\'s long, but with Chinese there shouldn\'t be any problem understanding. Do keep your eyes open for some \'unusual\' ingredients like Grilled Portobello mushrooms, artichoke hearts, edamame, and butternut squash. JUST SALAD also has a thing for pulses and grains too. There are plenty of them in the toppings menu, like barley, couscous, and something called ""Goji Wolfberries"". Do not be alarmed by the strange name, Goji Wolfberries are somewhat like barley, but with a decided bite and a wheaty taste to it.I ordered my toppings and soon the ingredients were sent to the staff with a double-blade mezzaluna to chop up. You may think that the little plastic bucket of greens and toppings won\'t fill you up. But once the staff started rockin\' the knife, voila! Your salad is ready with a drizzle of your vinaigrette of choice. My order happened to be mesclun mix, with portobello, artichoke hearts, edamame and Goji Wolfberries, and Sherry Shallot vinaigrette as dressing. The salad was packed into the lidded bucket of choice (the colours of choice are orange, green and white) . This entire salad costs $45. There are more toppings with extra charges on the menu should you feel you want a little touch of cheese, meat, or seafood in your salad. Don\'t forget to ask for bread, which comes complimentary with each salad. My salad turned out to be wonderfully crisp with a good flavour from the edamame. The portobello may look a little grey but fret nothing about it, the deep mushroom flavour will make it up. The Sherry Shallot vinaigrette is nothing like a mignonette sauce for oysters. In fact it\'s sweeter, and the vinegary taste is not as strong.Should you prefer someone else do make the decisions for you...Chef designed salads ($45 - $65) and wraps ($40 - $45) Be sure to keep the plastic bowl in case you plan to make next visits, as part of the eco-friendly menu, JUST SALAD is offering customers who bring their plastic bowl back 2 free toppings, as a token of thanks to help saving the planet...speaking of going green. Shouldn\'t we give it a try on tossed salads?! I myself will probably go back, to check out the now-renovating 2nd floor at the least! The salads are refreshingly sweet and crisp with a combination of textures. I gotta say though, eating more vegetables is a good habit, and why not start with a fresh introduction into the world of salads?Just Salad0Just SaladA bowl you can reuse.0A bowl you can reuse.Custom Made Salad ($45)0Custom Made Salad ($45)'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-just-salad/26677?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

Located in Wanchai, there always seems to be a line whenever I walk by. And if there isn't a line, it's always full.Boyfriend was amazed I had never eaten here as I pass by Wanchai so often. So, he made it his mission to bring me here. It was bustling and we squeezed into a small table that was already shared with 3 other people.Menu is in Chinese only. They do have an English one upon request. Boyfriend said they were popular for their chicken pie but we planned to order it later but after I finished my meal, I wasn't in the mood for it.We ordered the typical cha chan teng meal of the all day breakfast. Price $32. There is no 10% service charge.My usual drink is an ice lemon tea. But boyfriend suggested I drink their ice yuan yang as they are famous for it. Why? Because they prepour all their yuan yang ahead of time and stick it in the fridge. Um...ok. To boyfriend itmeant it was kept cold at all times and no ice is required so it wouldn't be watered down. To me, it was just plain lazy. Taste? I didn't like it. It had that rough texture that I dislike about yuan yang.0The set also included a macaroni in soup broth with some sort of topping. I chose ham. First of all ... it was so oily. Second the macaroni was so mushy. Usually cha chan teng pasta is not al dente but this was so over cooked, I didn't even need to chew on it. It was that mushy. The ham was so salty.0The set also included an egg of your choice (I chose omelette) and a bun. I chose dinner bun as I don't like pineapple bun. Even though boyfriend looked at me aghast that i didn't order their popular item of the pineapple bun. Yeah ... I hate the coating on the bun and just end up scrapping it off anyways. When it arrived, I didn't get a dinner bun but a pineapple bun with a big wad of butter. This is something I dislike even more. But as I feared that I would be yelled at when I ask for a correction, I ate it anyways (after giving all my butter to boyfriend). The pineapple bun was not good. This is not because I don't like it in the first place. The dough was still raw. I told boyfriend who scoffed at me and said I'm biased as I don't like pineapple bun. But when I showed him and tore off a piece, he agreed. The dough was not thoroughly baked. I tried a piece of his and his was the same as well. The bun was placed on top of my omelette which was so greasy. I don't know how much oil they added to the egg, but my hands were oily afterwards. The omelette was also filled with the same ham as what I got on my noodles so made for one salty, oily mess.0It wasn't expensive. But it also wasn't good at all. I've had better cha chan teng food elsewhere. I have no idea why this place is so popular. To make matters worse, it really wasn't hygenic either as I found a hair in my omelette. Boyfriend just said added protein. I won't be back."", ""Tried it once a year ago, disappointed, but then I thought maybe it'd be good this time, so I gave it a go - worst decision ever.  I was in a hurry so I quickly ordered a spicy pork noodles, sunny side up with bread and butter and a hot drink. Food came really fast, that was true. But then it tasted horrible!  It tasted so horrible that I didn't even finish half of it and I left. The noodles was overboiled. It must have left in the cooking pan for ages! And it tasted like MSG! Let alone the bread which tasted strange. It wasn't hot and it wasn't warm. The butter on the bread was poorly blended. I only had one bite. The sunny side up was so oily! The waiters just choked the dishes in the bucket right next to you and it was as loud as bombs!!Never ever had a meal that was so horrible that I would rather be starving for the next few hours than to have this!Why did I even think of going back?

The appearance was attractive and in light brown color. We cut in half and see the filling inside, but not too much filling. As the pie is made with  puff pastry, very buttery flavour and flake easily when eat. The filling is made with chicken, ham and mushroom, The filling taste fine, the pastry is a bit too thick.

Instead, it's their char siu that's getting a lot of love from the gang these days, which was what I got for myself this afternoon.Char siu & suckling pig1Char siu & suckling pigThe char siu was surprisingly succulent. Just a little more fat would have made me a real happy camper. Equally tasty was the suckling pig.

Now, I could concentrate back on my preparation for this all important meeting, without much complaint from my stomach."", 'Overrated, the restaurant mustve somehow bought their Michelin star. Goose was dry and fat, barely any meat. Service was at most ok. Wait staff didnt date to serve anyone, just there to turn tables. Absolutely not worth the money and wait time.', ""When we arrived around 1pm, there were a lot of people waiting. After asking around, we found out that there was no actual 'queue' (as in line up). We just need to inform the waiter number of people in our group and she will assigned us a number. It's funny that the number 9 was written in mirror image and we have a hard time figuring whether was it a 7 or 9.Waiting time was like 100 minutes as there were a lot of people waiting. There were 60 numbers ahead of us. It was Christmas anyway. We patiently waited for our turn (and also for others to give up their numbers). Haha. There were no place to sit, so we stand while waiting.Tips : You could have tea at famous Capital Cafe which is located nearby while waiting. Alternatively you could consider takeaway.The place was not very big, which has around 10-15 tables. We ordered one half roast goose, roast pork, BBQ pork and century egg (preserved duck egg) served with ginger.Kam's roast goose is definitely the best around. What set its roast goose apart from the others was its overall combination. No, the skin wasn't crispy type. In fact, they were served in yellow color secret sauce, which has a tinge of ground nut flavour. We couldn't imagine how well the blend was until we had our first bite. Then, there was no turning back. I've tasted the best roast goose  Plum sauce for dipping which is common in other eateries was provided but I felt that there wasn't such a need to dip as the goose itself was already so good. ** I would suggest if you are small eater, you can order the lower side quarter, 180 HKD. Upper side quarter is around 130 HKD. The drumstick is the prized meat, hence the lower side are more expensive.Another great dishes that was unexpectedly good was it BBQ pork. Simply divine. The meat was tender and the skin has a well balanced crusty bark.Next come the roast pork which was a complete disappointment. The skin wasn't crispy (in fact soggy) and the meat was too salty. Suggest to give it a miss. The century egg was just okay, didn't taste any different from other restaurants.

338,Kamameshi,Causeway Bay,Japanese,2.5,199.3,2.0,"Having been working in Wan Chai for a few months and first time tried this in lunch.This restaurant was not very full during lunch and we just waited around 5mins to get in. There were lunch menu served and most were potted rice with different toppings, vege, chicken, beef, seafood, etc. There were quite some choice.However, it did take some time to prepare and we waited more than 10minsIt finally came but it was a bit disappointing... Although the toppings were rich, the taste was rather plain... They did not have enough seasoning... Also, the rice was hard at the bottom... not crispy...All in all, it did not worth its price... Not recommend...0', 'Expectation turns into a disappointment.  That would be my overall assessment on .  We have relatively high expectation after reading the good comments on openrice so we decided to book the table for lunch.  Restaurant is kind of small with around 15 plus tables.  Space is very tight as mostly you would need to yield and move during the meal for people to get out for certain seats.  We ordered the  ($198)  ($178)Basically, they are steamed rice with 7 type of ingredient and seafood. It come with miso soup, japanese pickel, and we also ordered the ($38).  The miso soup and  are quite good.  They fried the shrimp in just right timing and the paste on the  is very nicely done.  After another 25 plus minutes wait, here comes the main steam rice dish.  The presentatation is rather nice and it come in a hot pot.  The overall rice smells quite good (with decent seafood aroma) but good thing pretty much stop right there.  The rice is nicely steamed but there are really not much taste at all.  That would be the biggest problem for me.  The shrimp is very soso (not very fresh as the texture is not good).  The ablanone is in decent size and taste just OK.  The whole experience is rather blend (but quite healthy I guess due to not much of oil and fat).  I feel glad that I have saved the Japanese pickel; otherwise, I would have a very hard time finishing half the rice.  In additonal, it is very obvious that there is not enough staffs as the only lady waitress has been scrambling around during lunch time.  Overall, as I mentioned in the very first sentence.  It is a disappointment considering paying hkd 450 for 2 for an almost no taste lunch.  I am rather surprised there are so many good reviews from openrice that makes me a bit puzzled.  Could it be just a bad serving for us?  You can give it a try and make a judgement.  However, I wouldnt go with very high expectation.000000200', 'New restaurants have popped up in Tang Lung Street! More Japanese restaurants! New lunch spots for me!The first one is Kamameshi. A shop that is dedicated to Japanese kettle rice. Or as someone who walked by said ""Japanese version of clay pot rice"". A pretty accurate description.0Just to show the only thing they serve is this, they have a large model version that puffs up steam every so often.0The place is not very big and a bit cramped. Menu is in Chinese only but they have a few words in English. But what you basically get is a kamameshi of your choice, steamed egg, tofu, miso soup and pickles. Prices are average $150 per set. There is no 10% service charge and is cash only.00Once you place your order, they immediately bring out your steamed egg, tofu and pickles on a tray. You eat that first as it does take quite a while for the kamameshi to be prepared. Plus the tray was pretty big for such a small table. So, you really have to finish this off or they have no space for anything else. The steamed egg was ok though half the cup was dashi broth. The meat inside the egg cup was overcooked and chewy. The tofu was alright. Nothing extremely special. The pickles were a bit dried out.0I ordered the crab version. After a wait of about 15-20 minutes, your meal arrives.0Lifting the lid (you are warned to be careful as the pot is hot!), I got this. It looked lovely. But it didn\'t smell fragrant. I mixed it as quickly as I could as I don\'t like the rice sticking to the bottom of and getting hard. But that was hard to do. There is a lot of rice and I did get three bowls of rice. The sad part was, there wasn\'t much flavor. It was a bit bland. I wonder if I was supposed to ask for seasoning? But that shouldn\'t be as all the other places I\'ve been to, the rice is seasoned and everything smells and tastes wonderful.0The miso soup was ok. Nothing too exciting about it. Just the regular dashi and a bit of miso mixed together.0I found it odd my bowl was chipped as the place was still fairly new.0I was a bit disappointed with this place. I\'ve had much better for a similar price. There was no flavor at all and that really doesn\'t bring me back.

To start with, they only offer one drink per person, if you want more, then add $20 per head just for the drinks.We ordered beef to try it out, they presented the dishes nicely, but the beef itself was really chewy, we couldn't actually eat it. We tried all kinds of beef, and none of them was acceptable. Some of them even came with the frozen ice on it.I was really disappointed to be honest, because I have tried the other BBQ buffet in hk, and even for the cheapest one, it was much better than this one.I honestly don't think it's worth the experience, and the restaurant could do so much improvement on it.Not recommended at all.I left there on an empty stomach, went out and had some other snack to fill it up...""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-kaminaribashi/103647?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

Because my last lunch of the old year had to be grand! So, I came here.Kani Kei serves all things crab. It's a Japanese restaurant that had opened recently and is located right next to Sogo.During lunch time, they have lunch sets a long with a la carte. Menu is in English and Chinese. All lunch sets come with crab salad, three appetizers, tempura crab or hairy crab, steamed egg custard, pickles, miso soup and rice or udon.0I chose the crab and sashimi sushi bowl set ($298). Yeah, a lot of dishes so let's break it down.0The appetizers from left to right was fermented beans, salmon salad roll, matcha tofu and cockles. Each were fine but nothing truly stood out. The match tofu was a bit grainy.0Crab salad was some bits of crab placed on top of salad greens. It was fresh and there was a light yuzu type dressing that went well.0Hairy crab was fresh and easy to get at the meat as it was pre-cracked for you. Not much flavor so it helped to dip it in the dipping sauce.0Chawanmushi had crab and roe on top. There was quite a bit of crab. But the egg was a bit too watery in texture.0Three little plates from left to right: crab fat, seaweed in yuzu and soysauce dipping sauce for the crab. It's nice they gave you some of the crab fat as that was gold. All the flavor of the crab was there and what was missing from the hairy crab meat.0Miso soup had no crab in it. That was a bit disappointing n it was just normal every day miso soup. Nothing spectacular about it.0Crab and sashimi sushi bowl was not a big size but it was the perfect size after all the mini dishes I went through. The crab was just layered on top and was sweet as they used snow crab here. There was also sea urchin and more roe.0A dessert was provided at the end and this was warabimochi. Soft and chewy and a decent end to the meal.0If you want all crab, this is the place for you. Lunch is a decent price for the amount of crab you get and that fit my purpose for my last grand lunch before the new year arrives. Food was decent but not spectacular.

Yes, definitely to try another of the four different lunch menus and if someone invites me, maybe also for dinner?!', ""After several satisfying meals of Shanghainese hairy crab over this past month, I decided to switch gears a little bit to try Japanese crabs! I made a reservation for lunch at Kanizen, and it was wet and rainy on that particular day. The service was attentive right off the bat when I arrived as the receptionist held on to my wet umbrella while the waiter offered to hang up my coat after I placed it on the back of my chair.Lots of live and fresh zuwaigani (snow crab) and tarabagani (Red King crab) greeted me at the entrance as if to whet my appetite! Can't wait!0Once inside, the first section of the restaurant consisted of a U-shaped countertop, which was where I was seated. There were also several tables in booths behind me as well for larger parties I presumed.1As I sat down, I was immediately drawn to my matching set of cherry blossom themed tableware. Love it! All the little details count!0There were 6 set lunch menus to choose from with prices ranging from $158 - $368. Since this is a crab place, most of the menus contained crab obviously but there was also a beef/pork shabu shabu lunch set as well for those who doesn't want crab. J and I ended up ordering 2 different lunch sets to share.Steamed Matsuba Crab Rice Set ($168)Appetizer(3/5) - the edamame looked like they had been grilled, but didn't really make a big difference in the taste of the soybeans. A separate container was provided for the uneaten skin. Slightly salty, the edamame was a great starter for our meal.Edamame0EdamameSteamed Egg Custard(4/5) - the egg custard was really good as the custard was hot and silky smooth! There was also a big chunk of crab inside so definitely enjoyable to eat.Steamed Egg Custard0Steamed Egg CustardMinced Crab Meatloaf(5/5) - I've had a lot of chicken tsukune before but this was my first time eating a tsukune made of minced crab meat. It was surprisingly tasty and delicate! The minced crab meat was soft while the flavor was fresh and sweet. A whole egg yolk was provided as a dip without any soy sauce, which served to enhance the delicate flavor of crab well.Minced Crab Meatloaf0Minced Crab MeatloafSteamed Matsuba Crab Rice(4/5) - the wooden rice box was brought in front of me to steam for another 6-7 minutes. After I was finished with my previous courses, the waiter helped us split the rice into 2 bowls. While the rice was good, it was not as flavorful as I thought it would be as there was no evident taste of crab infused in it. Instead I was more impressed with the crab meat and the salmon roe in the rice. The crab meat was delicious to eat while biting into a salmon roe with a bite of rice was a nice surprise every time. Steamed Matsuba Crab Rice2Steamed Matsuba Crab RiceExecutive Mixed Set ($368) - this set had the same appetizer and steamed egg custard.Assorted Matsuba Crab Tempura(5/5) - the tempura here was really good! First of all, the batter was really thin so you can still enjoy that fried taste but not overwhelm the fresh ingredients. 3 pieces of crab was provided along with some veggies and an egg yolk! The soft-boiled egg yolk was wrapped in a thin batter. It was so delicate that it broke when I dipped it into the tempura dipping sauce. *sob* It was still good though after I managed to fish it all out. Matcha salt was also provided as a condiment for the tempura.Assorted Matsuba Crab Tempura0Assorted Matsuba Crab TempuraGrilled Red King Crab(5/5) - this lunch set originally came with horsehair crab but we were informed that ours will be upgraded to a grilled tarabagani for this day. 4 pieces of crab arrived nicely charred and grilled. The crab meat was nicely toasted while tasting sweet and succulent. It was cooked perfectly as the meat was still moist and juicy. Little seasoning was used and none was needed. Yum!Grilled Red King Crab0Grilled Red King CrabAssorted Vegetables with Inaniwa Udon(3/5) - there was an opening in front of us at the counter for shabu shabu. Fresh vegetables were provided such as lettuce, mushrooms, and tofu. Two vinegar dipping sauces were provided - one clear and one brown.One serving of inaniwa udon was also provided for us to cook to our liking. The noodles were thin, firm, and chewy.While the shabu shabu was good, it was also nothing extraordinary.00Dessert(4/5) - two kinds of ice cream was available as dessert, which was coffee and ginger. The coffee ice cream was rich with soft and chewy jelly beans inside. I wasn't too keen on the ginger ice cream at first, but it was not as spicy as I thought it would. It was an interesting choice of flavor for ice cream as I was reminded of the ginger tea usually consumed after eating hairy crab. Coincidence?0Conclusion - between the 2 of us, the price ended up being very reasonable for the quality and amount of food we received! This restaurant is no doubt a great place for consuming Japanese crab. Not only was the food delectable, the service and ambiance were also commendable. I would love to come back to try their dinner as well!"", ""I went to Kanizen for lunch with a friend. We both ordered the Executive Mixed Set which included a steamed egg custard, assorted Matsuba crab tempura, Horsehair crab hotpot with assorted vegetable and Inaniwa udon and ginger ice-cream.Steamed egg custard:Delicious. The steamed egg was smooth and without any bubbles on the surface. There was a cube of crab meat in it which accentuated the flavor of the steamed egg.0Assorted Matsuba Crab tempura:Delicious. The tempura was crispy yet not oily. Not only was the Matsuba Crab tempura tasty but the other assorted vegetable tempura was also of top quality especially the mushroom, eggplant and pumpkin.1Horsehair crab hotpot with assorted vegetables and udon:Delicious. The horsehair crab was really fresh. I talked to the manager and noticed that they import the crabs directly from Japan and they arrive 3 times a week. No wonder the crabs are so fresh. The assorted vegetables were also very fresh. Udon was al dente and yummy.120Ginger ice-cream:Delicious. I personally like the ginger flavor. The ice-cream was creamy and yummy. If you also like ginger flavor then you shouldn't miss it. Otherwise, you can also choose coffee ice-cream which I would like to try next time.1Overall, it was an enjoyable dining experience and reminded me of a famous crab restaurant in Japan which I go to every time I visit Japan.I must also mention that service was very attentive. The waitors and manager were all well-trained and polite and they all carried a smile. That also made the whole dining experience an even more pleasant one.0Supplementary InformationThis restaurant has a high level of privacy for customers.  One has to go through two wooden doors in order to get to the dining area which I think was a very smart design.  First of all, it blocks the nosie and dust from outside especially when other customers enter or leave the restaurant while you are dining.  Second of all, people from outside cannot see the interior of the restaurant as the reception area is isolated from the dining area and there's a wooden door between the 2 areas.  The interior of the restaurant is a bit dark.  From inside you can see the outside but people from the outside cannot actually see through the window so there's a high level of privacy."", ',,;;,, ,,;!Crabs: Very good crab-themed lunch sets;Grilled, Tempura, Mixed with steamed rice and shabu shabu;Great value for money;Very good service.

In Japan, there is a special mixture called ""Kanisu"" (Crab Vinegar), specially used for crab cuisines. (Btw, ""En"" at TST serves crab shabu shabu hodai.)

The wooden container is placed on top of the shabu shabu stove and then steamed in front of you.Despite the salmon roes and the shreds of crab meat in the rice, the taste was on the light side. Possibly because this came after we had the kani miso.I suggest bringing the rice early. So customers could have it at the same time with other strong flavoured dishes. We added some crab miso to the rice. Udon (tempura set):I forgot to take a photo of this but the udon was good. Chewy.

The extra slight sourness of the yuzu flower is the absolute highlight for this dish that makes the taste profound.  The different texture of fish and tofu enhance the overall experience of the soup. Very interesting and indeed thoughtful!   3. TsukuriTwo types of sashimi.  Otoro and snapper. Super fresh and perfect temperature served in home made soy source.  The Otoro can almost melts in your mouth.  The light grilled snapper is very tasty, a totally different taste and texture vs Otoro.  Very interesting sashimi combo.4. HassunAbsolute highlight of the whole meal.  (I feel so bad that we forget to take the detail photo of this dish).  It consists of two sets.  One being the Grilled Mackerel with sweet miso and babe onion.  This is absolutely delicious.  I have nothing else to say as the miso source is absolutely perfect for the grilled Mackerel.  The babe onion pickel on the side just provide a sour touch for you in between each bite of the fish.  Absolute thumbs up!The second portion is a mixed of different taste.  Another highlight is the water spinach which is very delicious and it is an eye opener for us of using tofu paste and sesame flavour mixed together.... the horse Mackerel sushi wrapped in oak leaf has a touch of raw oak leaf taste which make this sushi quite unique.  Lastly, the absolute delicious plum in jello (strongly suggest eat last) gives a perfect ending for this delicious dish.  We are frankly lost in words.5. ShokujiJapanese steamed rice with eggs and deep fried mackerel with homemade soy source with different variety of japanese pickels and. It is a perfect balanced with suttle flavour that matches well with miso soup.  6. MizumonoJapanese fruit with ultra sweet mango, kiwi, and pineapple.  Perfect ending for the wonderfull meal.Easily this is one of the very best Kaiseki lunch experience we have ever had in Hong Kong.  The whole lunch theme is filled with summer ingredient and deep green color presentation for all the dishes.   The food quality, the theme of ingredient, the timing and sequence of dishes, the presentation, the environment, the service, the set up, ... everything it is top notch.  HKD 680 per set is even a bargain in my opinion.  We are in particular lost in words for the grilled mackerel!  Unlike Chinese cuisine that maybe more flavour driven on each dish. Japanese Kaiseki is a whole dinning experience they want customer to experience, and Kashiwaya executed perfectly.  No wonder this is a 2 stars restaurant already just the first year opened in HK.  It is definitely 3 stars waiting now.Again, head chef Atsushi Takahashi came out to say goodbye to us when we left the restaurant, and we took a photo with him together.Highly recommended (if you have the budget)!000Sakizuke0SakizukeNimonowan0NimonowanTsukuri0TsukuriHassun (Sushi roll)0Hassun (Sushi roll)Hassun (Plum Jello)0Hassun (Plum Jello)Shokuji0ShokujiMizumono0Mizumono'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-kashiwaya/475194?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

So what is one to do?You can come here.Located in Causeway Bay down Patterson Street, you'll see an alley way next to the Hysteric Glamour shop. Go down that alley and you'll find Katte Shabushabu. The layout is simple. A bar chair at a bar table and one single hot pot station just for you and you alone.0The menu is simple. They even have a swanky cartoon drawing of how to order. You choose your soup base, you meat and your sides. You can throw in some yakitori as well if you want. As the weather was cooler, it was time to shabu shabu so I came here for lunch. I was greeted by the wait staff who seemed to do everything from bartending, serving and cashing your bill. Later I found he was also the captain. He queried if I'd been here before and explained their menu and suggested the lunch menu is the most reasonable. I decided on the $168 executive lunch set which included assorted vegetables, Japanese pork, US beef, choice of two skewers ($50 and under), appetizer, Inakawa udon or rice, soft drink or dessert (which is just ice cream mochi). I chose udon and a soft drink and asked for yakitori suggestions. The staff told me that their chef does an amazing ox tongue so I chose that. My second yakitori was bacon asparagus.0I was then to choose a soup base from the four they had available: kimchi, bonito and kelp, sukiyaki and red snapper. The staff informed me that their signature soup base was red snapper so I chose that.Noted that hygeine was pretty good as they gave me two different chopsticks. One for cooking and one for eating. Most places don't unless you ask for it. As I work in microbiology, two different chopsticks at a hot pot place gave me top marks that I wasn't going to get sick afterwards.0I was given an appetizer of sesame seed marinated egg plant. It was cold and refreshing. The eggplant wasn't drowned by the sesame. Pretty good.0Two dipping sauces were given to me. Right is sesame and it was really thick. I've never had such thick sesame sauce. And it had a strong sesame flavor. Left is ponzu.0The soup base was red snapper and was very white in color. Taste was very sweet.0All the shabu shabu items were placed neatly on one plate. The assorted vegetables included various lettuce, enoki mushrooms, one shitake mushroom, shimeji mushrooms, one piece of Japanese tofu, pork and beef slices. The udon was also placed on the plate. Quality of the pork and beef were very good. Very tender. The udon was amazing. It was very chewy even though I boiled it for a long time. Portion size was just the right amount for one person.0The ox tongue skewer was really good. Pieces were quite large and cooked to a medium rare. Perfectly seasoned.0Bacon wrapped asparagus was also good. The bacon was crisp yet not burnt. The asparagus was still soft and juicy.0Pretty good deal for $168 as quality of ingredients was excellent. Even for a lunch set, they didn't skimp on the quality. Staff informed me that they were originally from Tai Hang (really?? I never noticed them) and they moved here recently. I would return if I am in the mood to shabu shabu and have no one to do it with at the moment.Should note as I was leaving, they had a chalkboard on one end that showed their daily seafood catches for dinner or people who want a la carte.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-katte/179549?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

Since four of us were girls, the three people portion should be enough for us,The bucket set came with six pieces of chicken, which three of them are lime chilli chicken and others were of original receipe. Changing normal flavour to lime chilli cost an extra $1.50. The bucket set also included three Mashed potatoes, two Mushroom Rices, one Chicken A La King rice, a box of Chilli Hot Spots, a basket of Crisscut Fries and three soft drinks.1) Lime Chilli ChickenThe Lime Chilli chicken were only mildly spicy and it did really had a taste of lime with it. The lime taste was refreshing and savory. The lime taste was strong but didn't bring any sourness to the chicken. The lime spices could unfortunately be tasted on the crispy coating only, but not the meat. Yet of you took in the whole piece with the flaky chilli coating, it should taste great. The coating were deep fried to give a great crispiness and a lovely flakiness, yet it was a bit too juicy/ oily. The oil was kind of sliding down along the plastic gloves to my forearm. The chicken meat were smooth and tender. It was nicely marinated and tasted really nice.2) Crisscut FriesThe Crisscut Fries were topped with sour cream and melted cheese. The melting cheese weren't literally melting, but were a cheese paste with a texture like mayonnaise. I always love Crisscut Fries and KFC had done a great job in this fries. The outer layer was crispy while the inside was still hot and soft. However it could get cool down pretty quickly. So, serve fast.3) Mashed PotatoThe mashed potato was something unexpected. it should be an innovative item that came with the lime chilli chicken combo. The new mashed potato was baked and thus had an additional layer of chewiness on top. The texture also changed and were made more tarty than the traditional one.4) Hot SpotsThe box of Hot Spots were literally chicken nuggets. One box came with approximately nine small pieces of chicken nuggets. The nuggets were cold, should be left for a while, so the flaky coating were soft and flat. The taste was not nice either, it was like eating a ball of stiff flour that filled with chicken.Overall I really love KFS's new chicken flavour, the Lime Chilli Chicken.

Specializing in a spicy miso ramen, they became so popular, they branched out in other areas of Tokyo and later in Taipei. Now, they have opened their first branch in Hong Kong. Located in Causeway Bay, near WTC Building.As it just opened, boyfriend and I made our way there to give it a try while it\'s still new. For as past experience has taught us, quality tends to decrease after the original chefs leave. We arrived at noon and there was only 2 people waiting so we didn\'t wait long. But the queue does get longer later on.0The whole shop has various ""devil"" decorations as they focus on spicy ramen which equates to Hell. A narrow bar area is on one side with table seats on along the other wall. We sat the bar to see the action. I found the seating a bit uncomfortable as I found the seat could not be moved. Apparently, it was nailed down so I ended up having my feet dangle uncomfortably away as I couldn\'t complete reach the counter unless I was merely leaning against the stool.0They had paper aprons for you if you don\'t want to get your clothes dirty.0The only condiment was their own Shansho pepper.0Menu is in English and Chinese. There is no 10% service charge. Toppings can only be removed. Adding extra requires extra money. There are five levels of chili pepper and Shanshu pepper. If you want their ONI level, it\'s $15. So, yes, it\'s not a cheap bowl of ramen. Ordering is by scanning the QR code on your mobile phone.0Boyfriend ordered Karabashi Miso Ramen with Big Pork ($115) and chose medium spicy and less Shanshu pepper. To boyfriend it was pretty spicy but still tolerable. There was a slight numbing sensation along with the spiciness from the chili. The soup was fragrant and strong. The big pork was really good, the right amount of fat and wonderfully seasoned. There is also a roasted baby corn and bean sprouts.0Boyfriend was happy camper. He finished all his soup.0I had the Premium Karabashi Miso Ramen ($120) and since I couldn\'t eat too spicy, I opted for no addition of chili pepper and Shanshu pepper. For those that fear it might be terrible as this place specializes in spicy miso, I am here to go against the grain and order something NO ONE will do. And? It was really good. The miso soup was salty but not as salty as most places I\'ve had just miso soup. A rich balance of fish with a pork broth could be detected. There was a roasted baby corn that was ok. I expected it to be sweet but it was not. Just a bit bland. A generous portion of bean sprouts were also found. The noodles were the thick kind and clung the soup very well.0The premium includes an egg which I shared half with boyfriend. This was sadly over cooked for ramen standards. It also didn\'t have much taste as well. At first I thought it was just us, but reading past reviews, this has happened to other diners as well. If you are thinking of adding an egg, I think you should save your money.0Instead of the one big slab of pork, I got it cut in two portions. This was gloriously good. I think the best pork belly I\'ve had at a ramen restaurant ever. It was fat but not so fat that I shuddered. The meat was tender and fell apart so easily. It was rich in taste from the marinade as well.0Portion size was quite big. The bowl looked small, but it was packed to the brim with noodles. The thick pieces of pork belly further contributed to a very full meal. Even boyfriend left the place very full. The soup was excellent and the mark of a good ramen restaurant. Even the non spicy version was good so for those that can\'t do spicy can try, too. Prices are steep but recently all the good ramen places are charging these prices. Hopefully they will keep standards high in the months later on. I\'ll be back.'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-kikanbo/640227?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

Saw their set lunch menu with a minced tuna and uni sushi rice bowl, sounds like my thing so I ordered the set. Unfortunately I was rather disappointed. What I couldn't really complain about is the portion, which indeed was very generous. Nevertheless, the tuna wasn't well diced so it's still in big chunks and I didn't find it very tasty. The small stuff that came with the set such as steamed egg and salad were all very mediocre.

354,Kin's Kitchen,Wan Chai,Chinese,3.2,125.0,0.0,"Having already been to the original shop in Tin Hau (now closed), I decided to visit the re-opened store in Wan Chai this Chinese New Year weekend and was lucky enough to book a cozy corner on a bustling holiday weekend. Also, right next to us, sat none other than the boss man () himself! The accomplished restauranteur and famed food critic was quietly sipping champagne and seated happily with his son; you have to admire him for his unwavering support for his namesake restaurant, almost every time I visit, hes in the restaurant. This time we overheard him talking about how to cook the perfect egg (sorry, not divulging trade secrets here  ).Needless to say, we were pretty assured the service and food would be good if the boss man was quietly scrutinizing it right beside us! So it made most sense for me to resample some of the favorites that made me like this restaurant in the first place. So first up wasKins Smoked Chicken ($170/half chicken).Kins Smoked Chicken - Simply sublime smoked chicken!...0Kins Smoked Chicken - Simply sublime smoked chicken!...The smoky woody flavor of the chicken was gorgeous with the slightly sweet soy sauce, just as I remembered!

Steamed Barbequed Pork Buns - A (slight) twist on a classic, yum!...0Steamed Barbequed Pork Buns - A (slight) twist on a classic, yum!...The Steamed Barbequed Pork Bun  ($27/3 pcs) contained soft bits of BBQ pork mixed with their characteristic BBQ sauce containing orange peel that gave it a wonderful flavor boost; while the bun itself was a little denser than expected but still retained a delectable floury smell.Patty with Turnip Shreds - Prefer a mushier filling...1Patty with Turnip Shreds - Prefer a mushier filling...The Patty with Turnip Shreds  ($39/3 pcs) was nicely constructed with a flaky exterior and warm long strands of turnip inside. A departure from your traditional dim sum is that the radish was cooked al-dente, giving it more bite that usual. In my opinion, the traditional one, which deconstructs in your mouth with minimal effort, is the winner here.  Mustard Leaves Steamed with Preserved Sweet Vegetables - You can judge a book by its cover here...0Mustard Leaves Steamed with Preserved Sweet Vegetables - You can judge a book by its cover here...No surprises with the Mustard Leaves Steamed with Preserved Sweet Vegetables  ($88), it was exactly as titled.

My friend ordered Tom Yum Gai as starter which tasted like water, and she unfortunately ordered the same crab as so-called ""main"".

I went for the lunch deal - which was reasonably priced at under $80 for a starter and a main. For starters I had the green papaya salad, which was just about alright. It was quite tasty, but went it overboard on the fish sauce, and was swamped in the dressing so it was too wet. It was also COVERED in peanuts which didn't do it any favours. The main I had was pad thai noodles which we just TERRIBLE. Too gloopy and tasted of ketchup. Plus it was supposed to have tofu in it, but these were deep fried beyond oblivion, so I didn't dare try it. Worst though was the service. From what I saw the waiting staff didn't get a single table right. Starters arrived at different times, or in some cases after the main course, and drink orders were forgotten until the end of the meal! At my table, my friend had completely finished their main course before mine even arrived. SHOCKING.

Therefore, I am more than excited to come again and try their other options on other days."", ""First Impressions: Came here for lunch at around 2 with my mom. Upon walking in, the atmosphere was alright, good music and nice decor. But as our server brought us to our table, there were crumbs on my seat. The set lunch menu was sub-par so we opted for one set lunch (Thai iced tea, Tom Yum Gong and fried rice) and some a-la-carte dishes (a roti and pork neck). Food/Drinks Ratings: Thai iced tea- probably made with 25% milk, 10% water, 15% tea and 50% sugar. I might as well have ordered myself a cup of sugar syrup, don't think there would have been too much of a difference. Tom Yum Gung Soup - the only good thing about this dish was that it was hot - as in temperature hot. couldn't taste the spicyness, the coconut milk, any of the seafood, or any of the fresh herbs. so a thumbs up for getting the soup hot, but a big thumbs down for pretty much anything and everything else about it. Fried Rice- dish had absolutely no taste. No essence of any Thai flavour at all. No peanuts, no like, not even egg. It was just made out of frozen peas, carrots and one small chicken cube in the centre of the dish. It was underwhelming and the dish wasn't even hot. Was a huge huge disappointment. Roti - When the server placed the dish down, there was a puddle of oil smothered on top of the roti. Needless to say, the roti tasted of a soggy bread with lots and lots of oil atop. Pork Neck - pork neck was relatively okay. but definitely cannot be compared to any other pork neck you taste in other Thai restaurants. The rub was sweet. You would imagine and expect a spicy, herby kind of run but the sauce and seasoning was sweet.... not too sure what went wrong there. Overall, food was definitely underwhelming - flavourless and didn't taste like Thai food at all. Chefs: (the Resturant had an open window for you to watch the chefs cook and whatnot) probably would have been a better decision on the Resturant owner's half to make it a closed one because it really did kind of make me worry about the type of food they are delivering.0 as you can see the chefs are more or less all on their phones. They touch their phones for minute then cook another. Makes me a little uneasy about what exactly im eating.. just food or a combination of food and their face oil and whatnot. The what appeared to be the head chef (not shown in the photo) was also constantly eating the food - with his fingers... then resumes to touching the food all over again. Service: Our server today either woke up on the wrong side of the bed, or is just terrible at his job. My mom and I were unsure about our curry order that we placed to start with, but then decided against it in the end. When we asked the server to cancel the order, he rolled his eyes, sighed audibly then walked away.... Not a very good start to or lunch. Afterwards, when my mom's Tom Yum Gung was served, the spoon was very chipped the trim of the soup spoon was destroyed on one side (could've easily cut a lip). So we gave it to the server and the server just let out a very long and sinister laugh before he went to his cooworkers, laughed again and got us another spoon.. not too sure what was too funny about a chipped spoon. Just as you think it couldn't get any worse, when we got the bill, the server forgot to take out the curry that we canceled from our bill. My mom told the server the server took the bill back and corrected it. My mom gave him her card and when she was signing the credit card bill, the curry was still on the bill.. he laughed again - again not sure what's so funny about cheating a customer- then gave the correct bill the third time. Final Thoughts - Don't think I will ever make a second trip to this resturant and will be strongly advising my friends and family to stay away from the resturant, as much as possible.... walking away after drinking a whole bottle of water, my mouth and everything still feels drenched in oil. was looking very forward to some nice Thai food at a nice looking resturant... but got the exact opposite.. not even sure if it can be called Thai food either... unless you're looking to be disappointed or for whatever reason you decide to eat at such a disgusting resturant, then go ahead, be my guest. Otherwise, please don't go and hope that the resturant will soon close down and the space will be put to better use. (even a McDonald's will be more satisfying that this resturant).""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/wan-chai-koh-thai/51600?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

Koku Ryu Ramen sits on a cozy spot on Swatow Street(which has quite a few different easy eating spots for lunch)in Wan Chai. We went in for a quick lunch just a little before 12pm and was surprised to see that the ramen shop was already fully packed! Luckily we were the first ones in line and in we went.This is the front entrance of Koku Ryu Ramen(which I pulled off of their FB page!)0My order! I prefer a firm- almost crunchy type of noodle! Is that weird? How do you guys like your ramen noodles done? Also.any other other recommendations for ramen spots!? Im always on the lookout for goodramenfood joints. So please let me know if Ive missed your fave places!RAMEN!!!0RAMEN!!!Uh oh!!! Thatporklooks slightly raw!!! Which is definitely a no no, so I pushed the meat down and let it cook some more in that hot, flavorful and thick pork soup stock. The soup was addictive and downright delicious but definitely very full and starchy.Soft boil egg in ramen0Soft boil egg in ramenA perfect slightly runny, soft boil egg in my noodles! We also split a plate of pork dumplings that I obviously forgot to take a picture of.The ramen here is pretty good but a bit on the pricey side as its about the same price asButao RamenandIchiran!', 'Among the 4 Japanese ramen shops I tried (Kimitora, Koku Ryu, Kuroganeya, Tokyo Agura) in Wanchai, Kimitora and Koku Ryu always havea lotof people waiting outside during lunch hour.I like Koku Ryus soup base the most. The soup base was thick and had strong flavor. However, even though the soup had strong flavor, it was not very salty. I kind of felt the soup was more like the essence/juice of the meat and bone. The BBQ pork tasted good but not spectacular. I would preferred thicker slides of BBQ pork to match with the strong flavor of soup. The noodle was a little bit soft, and not as chewy as Kimitoras noodles. The service there was friendly and helpful.Kokuryu Prok Rib Ramen0Kokuryu Prok Rib Ramen', 'Okinawa ramen.Decent Tonkotsu & Hakata noodles.Interesting beef tendon ramen.A bit overpriced.  This relatively new ramen joint in Wan Chai is from Okinawa. To be perfectly honest with you, I don\'t think Okinawa is that famous for tonkotsu ramen. Okinawa is famous for a type of flat noodle (souki), which is similar to a flatter type of udon served in Nagoya instead of ramen. So I was a bit skeptical....0...0We went in almost immediately and, fortunately, got a table seat; otherwise, some may find the place cramped. The lighting of the place was dim, which was comfortable.They had about 10 counter seats and 3 tables for two persons. Slightly more cramped than other Wan Chai ramen shops such as Kamitora and Yukitei.The colour theme of the shop was black and red, no doubt matching the name of the shop, which is translated as ""Black Dragon"".The menu was in Chinese and English. It is fairly self-explanatory:1The options were fairly limited. I understand that their signature ramen is beef tendon noodles. My friend ordered the Beef Tendon Black Tsukemen (soup served separately) version instead of the noodles in soup version.I ordered Super Spicy Tonkotsu ramen with hardest noodles. (Even though it says pork rib, it actually means tonkotsu. There isn\'t any pork rib in the ramen.)It came after a short wait. - ...$ 880 - ...$ 880The default setting didn\'t come with an egg. It came with a piece of char Siu, menma (pickled bamboo shoots) and some dried nori.It looked presentable.First things first, the soup. The Tonkotsu flavour was quite rich. Somewhat similar to Ichiran and Kamitora but not as rich as Nagahama No.1, Ramen Joe or Gogyo. There isn\'t much gyogai (shell fish/marine products) taste in it. It\'s primarily tonkotsu. Decent but nothing spectacular. When it comes to Tonkotsu gyogai, Tokyo Agura is still the best in town. - ,0 - ,The ""super spicy"" element came from the homemade chili paste. Even super spicy wasn\'t anything special. Similar to the spicy sauce used in Ichiran. Not very spicy at all. I barely broke a sweat. The spicy tonkotsu soup at Kamitora was richer and spicier. This was quite a let down. - 3...0 - 3...The noodles were the thin Hakata type like those served in Ichiran and Nagahama no.1. Super hard came as super hard. I was quite happy with the texture but not happy with the portion. It was even smaller than those served at IchiRan. I was barely half full and was tempted to have another noodle - at another ramen shop. - 0 - The char siu was nothing to write home about. It was the lean type, probably from the shoulder, which was fairly dry. The meat taste was quite pronounced but I still prefer a slightly fatter version.BLACK - ...$ 980BLACK - ...$ 98My friend\'s beef tendon tsukemen was similarly unsatisfying. You could see a bit of fish/shell fish powder placed on top of the noodle sauce. However, it lacked complexity. The noodles were OK. The two pieces of beef tendons were nothing special. He thought it was just ""OK"". He preferred those served at Ore no tsukemen.: BLACK0: BLACKTo conclude, the soup and noodles were decent enough but not spectacular. HK$88 for such a small bowl of ramen is fairly overpriced.', ""Came here again but this time instead of beef tendon ramen, I tried their beef tendon tsukmen as it was sold out last time I was there.The noodles were thick and chewy. Didn't have a starchy after taste which was good.0The broth itself was super salty but there was a faint fish taste to it. You need to dilute it with the clear broth they have on hand.0There were bits of beef tendon in the soup that soaked up all the saltiness.0The ramen came with a whole egg (so no need to order one). It was lovely as last time. Nice runny yolky goodness.0All in all, I liked their regular ramen more. Their tsukmen was ok. Not great but ok. Don't think I'd order it again."", ""I have been lazy!

The char siu too was good and melted in my mouth too, but again there was only 1 piece. The egg was included, so I was glad I didn't add one. The egg was okay.

The exterior looks like a cute little wooden house. It was the middle of lunch time and I waited 20 minutes. The lines died down after peak lunch hour was over.0Interior is your typical ramen restaurant. Bar stools at a bar table over looking the chefs at work. The chef was a Japanese woman. I've never come across a Japanese woman behind the counter before. Wait staff included one Japanese woman and someone who spoke Chinese.0Menu presented three different types of ramen. They had pork rib or beef tendon in soup base or beef tendon tsukemen (or ramen you eat in a dipping style). When I sat down, I was informed the tsukemen was sold out (it was only 1 PM on a weekday!) I chose the beef tendon ramen ($98, no service charge)) in medium noodle texture. Originally I ordered an egg but I was informed that the ramen came with an egg. I did notice they had raw or medium egg. I asked how raw was the egg and they said it was really a raw egg.

362,Koon Thai Hai Nam Chicken,Wan Chai,Thai,3.1,78.5,2.0,"Koon Thai was once very popular with many more stores spanning across the four corners of Hong Kong but over the years a number of its branches have closed down. The reason is very much because it's average. The chicken is alright but the rice is always too soft. You're better of getting the msg laden soup noodles with your chicken...However, the price is relatively inexpensive. At HK57 you get full and includes a drink for the lunch time set. There are other items like Tom Yum Soup noodles - I've had this before and tastes bland beyond. Also the curries you're better off going to the supermarket and buying the microwave version...But the chicken is not bad, you get a good serving compared to most places. The dipping sauce is above average with decent flavour and spice and not too sweet.It's simply one of those places you would go if you can't think of anything else and probably after a 1 or 2 has elapsed from your previous visit...00"", 'We have always meant to try this chain, but were not bowled over by the food we had.We ordered the chicken rice, Thai fishcakes in penang curry and laab.The chicken rice came out first. The soup was OK, a little lacking in flavour, but not bad - no MSG at least. The rice was also meh - it really should have more chicken broth flavor, but it was better than some I have had in HK. The chicken was nothing special and had some overly chewy parts. The wing was an awful jelly abomination.The fishcakes came next. They had zero flavour and were basically a rubbery vehicle for the overly sweet penang curry. It had the kafir lime leaf taste, but was too thick and sweet and had no spice to it. Sad immitation.The laab was OK. It had the right level of spiciness and was prepared pretty well. It was the saviour of the meal. When I lived in Thailand I used to eat laab moo a lot and it is one of my favourite dishes. While this was not as good as most of the ones I had in Thailand, it was pretty decent.Needless to say, we will not be returning to Koon Thai. There are much better Thai places that the Thais go to.

You mix your own and there are lots of sauces, condiments to choose from and they are all in little pots on a tray put on your table. I always put soy sauce, tasty sauce, sesame sauce, chilli oil, vinegar, bean sprouts, cashew powder and black pickles and it's always so tasty. I had 3 small bowls Should have mentioned the assorted cold platter first. You can choose the combination. We had crispy eel, ma lan tau (like a diced salad of leaves and bean curd), mock ham, mock goose and kao fu (spongy bean curd) with fungus. Yummy Chicken in fried bread rolls. These used to be mother in laws' favourite but today they were not popular. I myself find it a bit bland. It's bean sheet on outside with bread layer and mock ham and vegetables inside, then deep fried in batter The waiter insisted we order this bean curd dumpling special with slices of mock ham in between and sprinkled with pickles. I didn't like it as I don't normally like bean curd dumpling. No texture and just nice for show  Abalone mushroom with sweet potato leaves were nice. Sweet potato leaves is a nice tasting vegetable with a slight bitter tinge and a rough texture. I quite like it and it is not common in HK. We also had a jug of fruit tea which has fruits inside but actually no tea. If my daughter was here, she would eat up all the fruits but pity she couldn't make it.So another satisfying meal.

373,L'aLtro,Central,Italian,2.9,407.0,0.0,"This place is headed by a two-star Michelin chef Philippe Leveille, serving Italian cuisine with a modern twist. So it was a Sunday morning and of course we slept till the sun's up and bright. Had a booking for 1 pm, turned up at the restaurant around 1:30 pm and was told that we need to return the table by 2:30 pm due to a private event booking. Can't help but felt a bit annoyed since they should have told us when we made the booking. Anyhow, we weren't bother to look for another place so we sat down and ordered. 0Restaurant interior -The setting is simple, nothing too fancy but pleasant. OK. Fast forward to the main focus - food! So here's what I tried:0Burrata di Andria, tomato and aubergine terrine, gazpacho shot -Nice mix of flavors - you can taste each of the ingredients complementing each other. 0Cold foie gras escalope, caramelized figs, red wine and brioches -Personally would have preferred a smooth piece of foie gras without the addition of the purple-ish vinegar 'skin' over it. 0Fresh spaghetti with lobster and three different tomatoes sauce -This was sooo good! Al dente spaghetti, great balance of acidity and sweetness, lobster meat was firm and succulent0Sponge pudding with rum (was offered as an alternative since the other desserts on the lunch menu were not available) -Was alright, the pudding was a bit stuff on itself - guess that's where the rum comes inFinal Thoughts: Wouldn't mind re-visiting to try their other dishes. A slight take back was the service - there were 4 waiters serving my table of 4 and another party of 2. Still, they were not very attentive and one of them was even a bit rude/ blunt. - Z"", ""On the surface, L'altro has all the fixtures of a nice restaurant from the sleek decor to the fancy platings. Since I was staying in town over the holiday break, I decided to make reservations at several Michelin restaurants I wanted to try and L'altro was one of them. Whenever possible, I'd like to make reservations online and this restaurant had that capability. I made the reservation online by filling out their form, and got a call shortly confirming my reservation. Nice~Located at The L Place, the restaurant was bright and airy during the day and had a view over The Center. The decor was sleek and modern with minimal colors except for the festive decorations. An impressive series of wine refrigerators took up one side of the restaurant.00Our table happened to be right next to the Christmas tree! How festive! We were given a rather large table that can seat 4 people even though there were only 2 of us. It may be because the restaurant was actually not that full at all during lunch time.0The lunch menu was pretty simple with 2 courses at $268, 3 courses at $298, 4 courses at $398. We each picked the 3 courses with a starter, main, and dessert. When I asked the waiter to explain some of the items on the menu to me, he just sort of recited the menu which wasn't that helpful. We also noticed some wrong spellings on the menu (like the word potato), which is not a big deal but it does reflect on the attentiveness of the restaurant.1Bread Basket - our bread basket was plentiful and most importantly - hot. No olive oil or balsamic vinegar was given however. Not an issue as each of the bread was pretty flavorful. The tomato bread roll had bits of dried tomato bits as an added texture. The rosemary bread roll was fragrant and tasty. The sourdough wheat bread was tangy and refreshing to eat.0The starters came out rather quickly after we ordered.Slow Cooked Japanese Egg, Delicate Salad and Mustard Dressing(3/5) - the slow cooked Japanese egg was buried in the middle of the salad, which was cooked nicely as it was soft and liquidy. The salad was fresh but the flavor of the dressing was not apparent. We could not taste it at all and depended on the egg as condiment. A so-so and bland dish overall.Slow Cooked Japanese Egg, Delicate Salad and Mustard Dressing...0Slow Cooked Japanese Egg, Delicate Salad and Mustard Dressing...Panfried Baby Squid, Datterino Tomato Coulis and Cous Cous (4/5) - loved the bright colors of the plating of this dish. The squid was nicely panfried as it was slightly crispy on the surface. It could be fresher though. The couscous was light and grainy, and went well with the tomato puree sauce.Panfried Baby Squid, Datterino Tomato Coulis and Cous Cous...0Panfried Baby Squid, Datterino Tomato Coulis and Cous Cous...After the starters, it started to go downhill as we had to wait 20-30 minutes for our mains.Parma Ham and Ricotta Tortelli with Consomme (1/5) - what a disappointment! When this finally came, we noticed a strand of hair on one of the tortelli. We had to send it back of course but no apology was given. We waited another 10 minutes for the new dish to arrive. The consomme was poured on the spot. Unfortunately, it was way too salty! The parma ham was really salty while the skin of the tortelli was thick and hard. The portion was also pretty pitiful with only 4 small pieces.Parma Ham and Ricotta Tortelli with Consomme0Parma Ham and Ricotta Tortelli with ConsommeKurobuta Milanese, Curry Potato Mash and Chips (3/5) - this was highly recommended by the waiter. The plating was again very pretty with the contrasting colors and symmetrical positionings. Too bad the pork was a bit tough and bland. It was not tender at all. The potatoes were tasty though especially the purple colored chips. Again, pretty small portions with only 2 pieces of cubed pork.Kurobuta Milanese, Curry Potato Mash and Chips0Kurobuta Milanese, Curry Potato Mash and ChipsFinally the desserts came out quickly after we finished our mains.Figs and Vanilla Pannacotta +$28 (4/5) - the desserts here were probably the highlight of our meal. The pannacotta was rich with vanilla flavor while the pastry base was buttery and crunchy. The figs were also sweet and delicous to eat.Figs and Vanilla Pannacotta0Figs and Vanilla PannacottaGelato Miramonti (4/5) - I had read that this dessert was highly recommended but it didn't arrive in a little mountain as others have experienced. It came in a martini glass with some chocolate syrup poured at the table. No biggie. The gelato was silky smooth while the chocolate was slightly bitter, which nicely counterbalanced the sweetness of the gelato.Gelato Miramonti0Gelato Miramonti0Conclusion - my dining experience at L'altro was disappointing to say the least. For a 1 star Michelin restaurant charging $300+ for lunch per person, the value for money just wasn't there. The food was not impressive while the portions were tiny (even for a girl!). The service could be better as well as the staff just seemed disengaged and standoffish."", ""This is actually my second visit to L'altro, since my last lunch here was rather rush, but the burrata with tomato cream had left me with a strong impression, I decided to return and had a relaxing lunch during my holiday.Seated at the corner, it was a rather quiet corner that I had it all to myself, and perhaps because of this corner, servers were rather non-attentive that I had to hold my hand up for quite a while before they noticed me. I asked about the Risotto of the Day,but did not receive a satisfactory answer - 'risotto with a kind of white fish with cream sauce'. Given it was a michelin starred restaurant, I reckoned the minimum requirement would at least have the server telling me what kind of fish would be served, how it would be cooked. Finally,I opt for the 3-course option and was served with the bread basket. I especially liked the sun-dried tomato one though its aroma was stronger its taste.0Bread Basket0Bread BasketSun-dried tomato bread0Sun-dried tomato breadMy appetizer was presented to my table not long after I started nibbling my bread. It wasTomato 'panzanella', buffalo mozarella and 36 months cured ham.Tomato with mozarella was my usual choice for appetizer, and it came in a lovely twist! Panzaella is a Tuscan salad of soft bread and tomatoes. The bread was soaked with different kinds of seasonings, like onions, olive oil and vinegar. I could literally taste the 3 layers separately, first the panzanella with tomatoes, then the mozarella started to take over my tastebud, and at the final bites, I could smell and taste my ham. It was a lovely idea to add the cured ham onto the appetizer, which was indeed a good alternative to the more common Insalata Caprese. It did not make it a heavier dish but brought out the essence of the fresh mozarella and tomatoes.Tomato Panzanella, with buffalo mozarella and parma ham...0Tomato Panzanella, with buffalo mozarella and parma ham...Even when the server did not give a descriptive elaboration on the Risotto of the Day, I wanted to be adventurous and had it for my main. It was OK, the fish meat was rather tender, with crispy skin and the oil and juice in the fish was well preserved in the meat. The risotto was slightly too cheesy for my liking. I could only finish half of it since I needed to save some space for dessert.1As for dessert, of course I chose the famousGelato Miramonti.The first time I came, it arrived on a wheeled table like an ice-cream mountain which was served later on a martini glass with strawberrie. Not sure if it was because this is rather time-consuming or there was not enough servers on duty, the gelato was just presented on the martini glass right away and brought to my table. I was a little disappointed that consistency was not kept. Well, the gelato still tasted awesome, it was silky smooth with a strong egg and milk flavor.Miramonti Ice-cream0Miramonti Ice-creamTo me, dining consists of both food and service. If the 'showcase' of gelato had never been performed, there would not be any disappointment. Plus if it targets the fine dining sector, I reckon servers should be able to give a richer elaboration on the dishes. If it is really hard to memorize everything, little cards with explanation could be printedand shown on the tables. Overseas first class restaurants are already doing that and it is not anything new. Not only should a great restaurant keep up with its food quality, but it should also maintain at least the same service quality every time a diner visits or re-visits the place."", 'I had some pretty good experience dinning at restaurants with Michelin Stars or operated by chefs awarded wtih Michelin Star. I guess I was spoiled. Food connoisseurs, please lower your expectations if you really want to try this restaurant.My wife and I sat down at the table and the waitress came over and introduced the set menus for the day. There was no hard copy of the menu, according to the waitress, they were too busy preparing the official opening on the following Monday. I would say that\'s an unprofessional excuse for laziness. Anyway, here is the menu:Tasting Menu - beef tartare for appertiser and red snapper for main dish. Sounds like a $138 daily set menu at Soho!Set Menu - squid salad or soup as first course, sea bass risotto; linguini with tomato in 4 styles (sounds interesting); or veal as the main course.I had a glimpse of their other Tasting Menu on the \'Menu"" and thought of ordering the 4 course menu priced at $880, but somehow I told myself I shouldn\'t take the risk. It was the right decision with hindsight. So we ordered the set lunches. While we were waiting, bread was served, but no sign of olive oil nor balsamic vinegar. Even after we asked for them, we had to wait for more than 5 minutes for the olive oil and vinegar!?! There were just about 5 tables of diners and at least the same number of servers around if not more. I wonder why? The microwave oven reheated bread was very hot outside and very dry inside. How do you like that?We had the squid salad, presentation was OK, colourfully garnished with the different types of vegetables. The taste is acceptable but it\'s kind of interesting for the squid they used. All tentacles! Where was the body? I guess they saved them up for the more expensive dishes, not for set menu!My wife had the fish risotto. It wasn\'t bad at all. The lemon zest added to the risotto gave it a nice refreshing taste. Unfortunately, the veal I had wasn\'t too desirable. The chunk of meat sat on a bed of greenish-brown paste and the whole dish was merely warm. I must say I prefer the $40 beef brisket noodle. At least the meat is tender and the soup is hot. Yes, it was really that bad!They served only one type of dessert, house made gelato. The waiter pushed out a trolley with a mountain of gelato enough to serve 10 people, but he scooped two tiny servings of gelato into two glass containers and added two tiny spoons of strawberry compote on top. Then push the rest of the gelato and compote back to the kitchen. The ""show"" may impress a 10-year old kid, but definitely not me. Qulaity of the dessert? Nothing to write about!My wife and I didn\'t add sugar to after-meal tea/coffee. Only after I finished my coffee then I realized they didn\'t bother to offer us sugar at all. Nice service!Thorughout the entire meal, nobody came by to ask for our comments of their service or food quality. Something that you would expect from the waiter, head waiter or manager for a newly opened restaurant. I notice that the waiters were only attentive to the guests of one table. Obviously the lady guest seemed to know one of the staff there. I overheard them discussking about having a birthday party at their restaurant. No wonder! That\'s why they were served petit four, but not for our table.In return for their discriminative service, I didn\'t tip them at all. First time in my life at a ""proper"" restaurant.While lunch is always charged at a lower price than dinner but I belive if a restaurant cares about the quality of food they serve, the dishes should be prepared equally well. For restaurants that can\'t meet this simple standard, they don\'t deserve my repect or money.

Though I have been visiting them for a few times , but they never let me down. They have ten different lunch sets, including sushi/ sashimi set, charcoal grill fish sets, meats sets and chef recommended sets. 0The price ranges from $260-$330, while their mini kaiseki set would be $680. Compared to the top Japanese restaurants, their lunch set are not too expensive. I found most of the newly opened Japanese restaurants in central or Causeway-bay, they are charging $280-$380 for a bowl of eel rice. I come back again for La Bombance eel rice with goose liver for no doubt.Charcoal grilled eel rice with goose liver $3300This set comes up salad, custard egg ,eel rice and dessert.Salad0The vegetable are so fresh and crispy, with a hint of roasted cheese thins and the Italian dressing, it is very simple and light , quite fit for the hot summer. Steamed egg custard( originally almost $180)0It is so pretty and elegant! Truffle is just like a flower sitting on custard egg.The custard egg is so creamy, topped with a layer of chicken soup broth. The broth is rich in flavor and smooth texture. Apart from creaminess of custard egg, there are also crispy rice, it adds a layer of crunchiness contrasting to the smooth egg custard. The black truffle is so tasty, its fragrance goes extremely well with the rest of the ingredients. I could not find a word to describe how good the custard egg can be. Thats the best that I had so far! No wonder that is one of their signature dishes.Rice box with charcoal grilled eel and goose liver 0The grilled eel is freshly prepared, order to grill. It has charcoal aroma and crispy texture, it taste particularly good as it is grilled with homemade sauce. Whether The seasoning, fatness nor texture of the eel, tastes so much better than those pre-made eel rice! It is not too sweet, and it is not too greasy, the texture of eel is so firm and fatty, it proves that the eels quality is high. 0Another important ingredient of this rice box is the goose liver. It is light seasoned, have the rich intense flavor. The surface is crispy outside , soft inside. it is so creamy, almost melting in the mouth, it tastes awesome! 0The goose liver, charcoal grilled eel , Together with the special prepared sauce and Japanese rice, what a heavenly made rice box! Really irresistible! Miso soup0Though it is simple miso soup, it is not too salty , the taste is mild and pretty good though.Dessert- Blancmange0It is the French milk pudding with white coffee flavor. The texture is in between custard and pudding, very creamy and smooth, rich in milk flavor and  also comes with a hint of white coffee flavor. The look seems ordinary, but It tastes really really good! What a beautiful marriage between milk and white coffee! I love it more than icecream! This one is also known as one of the Tokyo La Bombance signature. Overall, I love this restaurant very much. The environment is modern and nice,  also comes with with spectacular views. The food is stunning and made of prestige ingredients, and service is really good too. Price wise, it is not very expensive for lunch, just like any other mid grade Japanese restaurants. I will come again for sure. May be next time try their kaiseki set. Highly recommended. 0', 'This is the second time we visited La Bombance for lunch since it opening in 2016 at V-point.  As usual, the restaurant is clean, quiet, contemporary, and with spectacular view of the Victoria harbour.  Restaurant has 3 box suites and main dinning area can fit for 50 customers.  Lunch set menu is simple and me and honey both ordered the grilled eel rice with foie gras.  (See the photo for the menu)What a spectacular lunch it turns out for the following 2 dishes.  After the refreshing tuna salad, the truffle steam egg simply makes me want another serving right away.  The right amount of saltiness, the broths, the steam egg along with a few slice of black truffle is simple stunning.  It is the direct receipt from their Tokyo\'s Michelin star restaurant.The main dish with eel and foie gras, such combo is absolutely delicious.  At first, you may think the totoal portion is not enough, but it turns out just fine.  The sweetness as well as the charcoal flavour is just perfect as sometimes the eel could be too sweet in other restaurant.  The flavour and fatty of foie gras is perfectly hammorized with the eel and it really makes our day.  This is certainly new style VS the traditional eel rice that we are accustomed in Japan.I will skip the dessert writting (seesemme ice cream) and miso as the steam egg and eel rice certainly earns my respect and makes us very happy!  It is such a joyful experience and price is set at 330 for our four course lunch set, which is very fair and almost a bargain considering the view and food quality for the ""New style Japanese"" by chef Makoto Okamoto.  We will definitely comes back again for their kaiseki set in the future.This HK Michelin recommends Japanese restaurant is definitely worth to visit.

It was located on the second floor of the relatively new GardenEast complex.The restaurant touted itself as an Italian and French cuisine but we did not find any French flavours in the menu at all. Pumpkin soupThe soup was a bit light and could have been made more creamy.  Spaghetti with prawns and crabmeatThis dish tasted surprisingly better than what its presentation would suggest. I like my spaghetti al dente but unfortunately this one lacked the expected bite. However, fresh crabmeat was used instead of artificial ones (Japanese style), which did score some points. Squid ink risottoTo the contrary of our pasta, the squid ink risotto was made a bit hard for our liking. The risotto also did not carry enough of the squid flavour. Disappointing.Overall, it was a slightly below average dining experience (deserved 2.5 points for taste but unfortunately no such option here) and for similar prices, we would prefer the neighbouring DAP and Al Baita. But if you are ever tired of always going to the same places, this is definitely an option.  Bread basket0Bread basketPumpkin soup0Pumpkin soupSpaghetti with prawns and crabmeat1Spaghetti with prawns and crabmeatSquid ink risotto0Squid ink risotto', 'I havent been to this new address before, and it definitely gives a very different feeling than the old address. I was very impressed with the dedicated lift with 2 doors on adjacent sides, one for entry and the other exit (have never seen that before and it ranks just below the two-storey nifty lifts in the World Trade Center.) I was equally surprised by the serious restaurant entrance, a receptionist stationed at the reception stand who I half-expected to blurt out Bienvenue chez La Bons madame. Votre rservation SVP? ROFL. Patrons have to walk through a corridor before getting to the dining room, as if you are going to meet Nicolas Sarkozy. The dcor was very faux luxury: cream-colour theme, crystal lighting, quasi-plush chairs, and lots of curtains. Theres certainly thinking behind all the pomp and circumstance. But any such illusion ends there, and I was brought back to life by being sat in the middle of the dining room. When I asked to change to the table by the window the waitress give a curt sorry its booked despite there being a few more empty tables around the place. Well, I was sort of expecting such a response lol. In any case the waitresses do look smart in their uniforms.Browsing through the menu, I see that for $88 I would get a salad/soup, New Zealand lamb chop, and coffee/tea with herbal/fruit teas options too. As before at the Ship Street address, you can add a dessert by paying an extra $10 to $25. Of course I zoomed in on the softie heart (lol what is the English name for this dessert? Baked choco pudding?) Ive never had this dessert here before, and everyone raves about it. We ordered our food and began to contribute to the increasing decibels. Acoustics were definitely an afterthought or no-thought for the owners, and noise levels were like the neighbourhood rough and ready dim sum restaurant. All effort to sex up the place gone to potAnyway, value-for-money is the name of the game, but I have to say its a moot point if that is true here. My salad was served in a small soup bowl with quite a bit of cress and some leaves and cherry tomatoes, and some suspiciously salad cream-like dressing. The main was quite ordinary: 3 pieces of lamb chops, some airy cut-up pieces of potato, and pieces of cabbage, zucchini (?) and carrots as sides. Lamb fat aplenty notwithstanding, the meat strangely did not have taste, and the meat was too fluffy for my liking. Methinks this came from a couch-loving mass produced animal, or worse still, had the honour of a bicarbonate soak before becoming dinner. Not a happy piece of meat. The saving grace was the softie heart at the end of the meal that is probably ordered by 9 tables out 10. It was warm and had the requisite amount of chocolate goo, but it was a bit floury, although the heavy chocolate taste was sufficient to mask most of it. Coffee was a very heaty dark roast that is common found in mid-priced restaurants.So my verdict? For a 4-course lunch at less than $120 without service charge, this place makes up for what it lacks in quality with ""luxury"" environs, noise levels excepted. Some would say this is a very good deal. For me, the fauxness of the whole place is the most lamentable thing, and I infinitely prefer the old address  it was thoroughly home-made but had a lot more heart. On my way back to the grind, I couldnt help but think that I had been unceremoniously fleeced, just like my poor piece of lamb whose only purpose was to become a thankless slab of stomach-filler.'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/wan-chai-la-bons-brasserie/30873?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

I ordered the roasted spring chicken as main course but it tasted like deep fried chicken. The chicken on the plate isbrownish colour as the chicken has been frozen for too long. The side dish potato mashwas worse than KFC and was tasteless, too button heavy.Since the place is small, the space is full of cooking smell and after the lunch, the smell still stained on my clothes.

380,La Piazzetta,Central,Italian,4.3,110.0,0.0,"After reviewing the comments below, I felt obligated the write some comments for one of my all time favorite Italian Home Style restaurant in HK: La Piazzetta. This restaurant has over 18 years of history in HK, You can always find Chef Paulo cook by the out door seats in the evening after 7 pm. I never expect dish presentation when coming to a home style restaurant, yet what I always expects and discovered was the consistance quality and pleasant smile for the waitress. There is one dish wish I always order for first time visitor to this restaurant, Linguini Marinara. If you love Linguini and Shell fish, this is the Must have dish, you can taste the ocean combined with fresh herb in every juice bite. The size of this dish is the most generous, recommended for sharing. I will get a picture of this dish up running soon. Pizza, never short of Cheese on top just like what mum would do for her son, Rich and creamy on top of the freshly hand made dough. My person favorite is the Quatro Stagiani, four topping including Artichoke hearts, toasted Mushroom, baby tomato and ham. Lover of spicy food myself would usually add a few drops of Tabasco sause and spice it up. Till today, La Piazzetta is still the only Italian restaurant in HK that surves Tiramisu with Marsala wine upon request, Tiramisu is prepared homestyle, the authentic display brings you right back to the street of Italy. I love the location, because because its quiet, I could hear myself without shouting. I trust the food here because most of the key ingredients are direclty imported for italian family food maker with generations of history in delivering nothing but homestyle, something different from most of the other Italian restaurants in town, 100% of the wine carried in here are imported from Italy.Supplementary InformationCertified with Italian Authentic Dining Restaurant in HK for 18 yrs', ""Inflation is coming, but finding a good quality restaurant with economy price in Central seems not to be a big question. Arriving there, we recognized it's been 1, so we looked for a nice dining for lunch. We walked from Central to Lan Kwai Fong, then to Stanuton Street, which was the heart of SOHO, finally we chose this Italian restaurant. Actually when I had a look at the menu, the thing that surprised me the most was the price. Located in SOHO, I could hardly imagine how did this restaurant survive (I mean the cost might be even higher than the price). So we decided to have a try. My dad and I each got a beef, with salad and soup ($88) being as the side order. My mom preferred to have something light, so she ordered a pasta with seafood ($88+10).I really enjoyed such ambiance, quiet, cosy with dim lighting, which reminded me of traveling to Europe in the past. In fact, I really enjoyed studying or relaxing in such atmosphere, especially when I felt sad. After sitting down, talking, enjoying, our set lunch came. First, it's our bread. The bread tasted like the ones in Western surpermarket, with sliced onions topped on the bread. Then, it's my salad. Nothing special, but the taste was not bad at all. Next, my beef. Oops... why didn't the waitress ask how would I like it done? Perhaps it's not a traditional steakhouse. But my steak was quite tasty, I could taste the tenderness of my beef. Every slice mixed with side veggies, moderating the sense of meaty and bulkiness. After, there's my hot coffee and finally my desert. The desert tasted kinda like pavlova, a common desert in New Zealand. I really loved the combination of creaminess and crumby. Haha!Overall, this Italian cuisine was really worth trying, particularly in a Saturday/Sunday afternoon. If there's a magazine, newspaper or fiction, it sounds better.00000""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-la-piazzetta/1788?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw
381,La Piazzetta,Wan Chai,Italian,3.6,105.0,,"I have been to the first La Piazzetta restaurant a few times with the same friend who recommended it and when I saw a branch open up in Wanchai, I thought it was worth trying as there are not many authentic Western restaurants in that part of Wanchai.I went with a friend and we both had salad to start, this and the bread were both a bit boring, the bread could have been hot or Italian but it wasn't. The salad had no dressing and we were expected to add our own olive oil and vinegar. Then we shared 2 pastas that we both wanted to order. Penne Arrabiata which was a little spicy, vegetarian and cooked al dente. The waitress came to grate some fresh parmesan cheese on the top with her electric grater.Linguine Mariana was not as it would be in the Soho branch. There were lots of clams, a few prawns, some small razor blade clams. In the Soho branch, there were more variety of shellfish and I think a big scallop with shell. Anyhow, I think they may use whatever shellfish they can find fresh in the market that day and could be totally different from the next day. Although the sauces of the 2 pastas looked similar, they tasted very different. The penne had a spicy tomato flavour and the linguine had a seafood fish stock type flavour. So we were glad we shared and the seafood dish was too huge even for the 2 of us. In fact, we didn't finish either pastas but liked them a lot.Coffee was nice and strong and we thought this was a nice little restaurant good for lunch for it was relatively quiet and not full. The service however is like the restaurant in Soho, neither slick nor cheerful.0dressing for salad and bread0dressing for salad and bread0Penne Arrabiata0Penne ArrabiataWith grated cheese0With grated cheese0""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/wan-chai-la-piazzetta/37971?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw
382,Lan Fong Cafe,Wan Chai,Chinese,2.9,32.0,4.0,"The typically crowded cafe0The typically crowded cafeFor today's lunch I wanted to have some typical cha chaan teng lunch set, so I went to Lan Fong Cafe in Jaffe Road. As typical, there were lots of people waiting for seats. The system for seating was a mess, some people were queuing at the front door, while some people just went in and seat at anyplace they found or just waited next to a table which is very likely to be emptied. Fortunately, I had my seat real soon, but I kept hearing people complaining about the seat arranging system.Anyway, I ordered this lunch set which had my typical cha chaan teng's favourite barbecue pork spaghetti and butter bread. The set also included an egg omelette and a drink which I chose hot milk tea. The serving speed was amazingly efficient, I guess my wait after order was within 5-10 minutes, which was very efficient indeed.1) Barbecue Pork SpaghettiThe dish was not as appealing as I thought it was. The soup was seemingly a little less, and the barbecue pork looked a bit too slim. However upon eating the dish, I found the soup was just enough for the dish, the dish was literally more rounded up in the middle, so the soup was kind of sink in. There was a strong pepper flavour in the dish which made it savory and nice. The spaghetti was made al dente and quite chewy. The barbecue pork although looking slim, was actually quite tender. Yet in general, I think it was just an average dish, not really special.mediocre barbecue pork spaghetti0mediocre barbecue pork spaghetti2) Egg OmeletteIt was just a typical egg omelette. It was 100% done in wellness, which I thought a 80% or less will make the omelette smoother and nicer looking. Hence, just a typical omelette.mediocre omelette0mediocre omelette3) Butter BreadButter bread was exceptionally mouth-watering. Check the whole piece of butter in it! What's more, the bread was hot to serve and crispy at the bottom. This proved the restaurant did put some time in preparing the food. The warm bread warmed up the butter and made it soft and smooth. The slightly salted butter went well with the warm sweet bread. Love the bread very much!Mouth-watering butter bread!0Mouth-watering butter bread!4) Hot Milk TeaThe hot milk tea was nice!

Very nice egg tart indeed.Nicely baked and puffy egg tart0Nicely baked and puffy egg tart"", ""Went in to try something new.

Today I had lunch here, their $328 set, including a salad, a prime rib and a dessert. Their ice cold spinning salad is good yo watch, but not very good in taste. Their prime rib with salad was okay, the beef wasn't bad, salad was not really noticeable. The whole meal was in general, soso. 0"", ""I tend to get my Lawry's fix every 2 months or so and always order the same roasted prime ribs. Finally, I told myself that I HAD to try other things. SO - roasted prime rib sandwich! 1 word: unforgettable.Thought the beef would be less in portion for the sandwich; it was exactly the same as the Hong Kong Cut (4oz). Rather than in slices, the cheese were in cubes but they melted right down after sandwiching between the toasted, fluffy ciabatta. Stringy in every bite, just the way cheese should be. The beefy flavor of U.S. beef is a given (and a must) and the whole sandwich just disolved in my mouth (did my eyes just rolled back? Mmm.) I didn't even touch the beef au jus because the prime rib was seasoned just right to eat by itself.The set lunch came with the famous original spinning bowl salad, warm fantasy choclate cake and coffee/tea (HK$308 + 10%).

For the tagliatelle you could choose that plus the soup.So I was very confused as to whether the soup was separate or the pasta was IN the soup.. I decided to give that a try. Most of my friends ordered the curry set, though whether that is French cuisine is questionnable. The taste was very similar to Japanese curry.The soup with tagliatelle was in fact soup with tagliatelle and whatever you chose (ratatouille, meat, mussels, salmon) in it. To keep constant with the Japanese example, let's say this was like ramen?I chose the cauliflower, basil sweet corn soup and ratatouille. Gosh, I haven't made a worse choice for food I think. The vegetables in the ratatouille were diced in very small pieces, making it almost like a tomato sauce on top of my soup and pasta. The soup itself also wasn't very strong, which would have been OK if it were just soup, but since pasta is tasteless too (just flour), there just wasn't enough flavour. Where's my sauce!!A friend who ordered the mussels with french onion soup and tagliatelle also wasn't satisfied. We though that perhaps the carrot ginger soup base with beef shanks may have been best because at least there was taste, though again the combination was a bit sketchy.I'm not sure if they're trying to save ingredients for dinner, and according to the dinner reviews, the restaurant seems OK. But lunch, no. I don't know what makes the lunch French at all.Well at least there's no service charge.Decor is antique with a lot of tree branches overhead, Christmas lights, and curtains making boundaries for 2 top tables.

Location was definitely great but there were much better choices just a bit farther out there at such a price."", 'Its difficult to find a restaurant for lunch without making reservation especially in Central. Luckily there was walk-in available at Liberty. We ordered Wagyu and risotto lunch set. The set includes starters, mains, dessert and tea. Wagyu was a bit overcooked but the risotto tasted surprisingly goodAnd I liked the soft shell crab salad very much. Its crispy and freshly fried! 100000', 'Haven\'t tried their lunch set for a very long time  since they have newly renovated. Their lunch sets are around $230-$300 + 10%.For the starters, we chose tuna tartare and beef carpaccio! Seems like tuna tartare is nicer, beef carpaccio that I had was just fine.Main course we got king prawn pasta, burger and fish and chips! I tried all of them, I really like the truffle mayonnaise with the fish and chips! Very nice one! For the burger, I like another burger shop with ""similar"" name instead of this one here.  The burger here was not juicy enough, a bit too dry.However, their cake was relatively good!Overall, if you work close by and don\'t know what to eat in the very last minute. This restaurant would be a good choice 100000000', 'My girlfriend and I walked in the restaurant around 12:15pm and were quickly seated at a table. Ordering from the lunch set menu, to start, we had Marinated Salmon and Tuna Tartar. The salmon was an uninspiring smoked salmon salad with a light marinade. The dried tomatoes that came with it were the best part of the dish. The tuna was a more interesting marinated tuna tartar with poached egg, avocado, spinach and a hint of horseradish or wasbi. It tasted quite good but when the tartar was mixed with the spinach it looked like a mess.Our mains were the wagyu brisket and chicken breast. The brisket was horrible - the thoughest piece of meat that I have been served at a restaurant and definately not brisket. When cut, juices poured out of the beef. It clearly not been rested before serving yet still managed to be lukewarm at best. The chicken breast was much better and drizzled with a creamy bacon sauce.Dessert of pandan panna cotta and lychee mouse was unremarkable.The staff was pleasant and attentive.Verdict: If you know what your ordering, worth a visit.', ""Everytime I walk past Liberty, I see tons of people dressed in business suits chilling, drinking and having a good time socialising - it never crossed to my mind that food at a bar restaurant could be this top notch, I guess afterall, the word 'kitchen' comes before the word 'bar' in its name?Sorry I could only take photo of the main course but this is what I ordered:1. Mushroom Soup 2. Tuna Steak3. Earl Grey Tea with teapot4. Dessert (had to leave before it was served, and the only downfall was that the food was served a little too slow and the waiter got my friend's lunch order wrong)MUSHROOM SOUPThe mushroom soup was tasty and rich with mushroom flavours, I also loved how it was not prepared with milk or cream but the texture was really creamy and velvety.TUNA STEAKI was slightly overwhelmed by the plating and choice of food pairing with this dish, which was a bit towards the fine dining side of things.  I particularly loved the runny yolk wual eggs and edible flowers.  To the fish itself, it was cook to perfection with centre remaining rare.  It was served with a slightly zingy and citrus sauce which elevated the flavours, like playing a mini triumph for me before I head back to work for the rest of the day!Lunch Set Main - Tuna Steak - Soup + Main + Drink + Dessert...$ 2980Lunch Set Main - Tuna Steak - Soup + Main + Drink + Dessert...$ 298 This photo with a clearer sight of the rare tuna that is perfectly seared just on the outside! 0"", 'Great place.

The dish was decently elegant, salmon perfectly cooked (not dry, not raw, juicy and good texture), served with good tasting vegetables .Dessert is forgettable.$188 for set lunch, service ok, food good, will go again.', ""I arrived on Friday in the lunch time. The owner was at the entrance welcoming people. Good point.

Service is good, very attentive.To the food now. I had a set lunch, price is very reasonable, I ordered portobello pasta, mushroom taste is just perfect and excellent, pasta cooked perfectly.  forgot to say about the starter, I had a Caesars salad, usually they will just give you a few pieces if you order set lunch in the other restaurant, but surprisingly the one from LEX is exactly the size I want, almost full size, home made Caesars dressing is fantastic, the whole combination is just amazing. If I had to be super picky, I'd just mention the seats, just so comfortable that make me don't want to leave.I'd definitely recommend it, the best set lunch, good atmosphere for happy hours, perfect venue for a dinner with a few friends. I would say - LEX is the new landmark in the HK map."", ""The bar is always full after work, and the restaurant is also full at lunch time.The set lunch is too big.

Once for dinner about 2 weeks ago and also the other day for lunch. I specifically went back mainly because: 1) I liked their burger quite a lot2) I didn't bring my camera last timeEnvironment: On both occasions I sat upstairs which was comfortable and spacious. I quite like their modern decor. I highly recommend sitting upstairs over sitting downstairs where it's more cramped, more dimly lit and also noisier due to its proximity to the bar. Service: One thing that immediately noticed was the high number of Caucasian waitstaff at Liberty Exchange. That is definitely unusual for a Hong Kong restaurant. The strange thing is the contrast between the Caucasian staff and the other extremely local waitstaff. Either way, the waitstaff was attentive and friendly. Food came out quickly and there were no mixups. For my dinner experience I shared the following with friends:  House-made sausage - The sausages came in hot Italian, herb and sweet andouille. My favorite of the 3 came was the hot Italian mainly because the taste was the most intense and reminded me of salami. The other 2 sausages tasted quite average. Portion size was a little on the small side for $98. Decent. Mussels with Tomato and Basil Broth - This was quite nice. The mussels tasted quite fresh and the sweetness from the broth complimented it well. I can't tell you the number of overcooked mussels I have been served in Hong Kong so this was a nice change. The mussels came with a side order of fries (not sure what makes these 2 items go together) but the fries were good as well. Nothing fancy...just crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Nice.  Peanut Butter & Jelly Sandwich - This is a gourmet version is with foie gras. Portion size was very small relative to the other 2 appetizers. Basically it was a deconstruction of a PB&J by having a piece of foie gras sitting on top of a miniature french toast-like cube with reduced raspberry sauce drizzled around. When you eat everything together it gives you the flavor profile of a PB&J. Not bad but I didn't think this was good value for money.  Eight-hour French Onion Soup - I had read online beforehand that its consistency was like gravy which sounded quite interesting. Although at the restaurant I felt this was very similar to normal onion soup. It was pretty tasty but not really any different from the onion soups I could potentially get at Dan Ryans or some other American restaurant.  Liberty Burger With Mushroom and Cheese- Now this I liked! Flavor wise it was juicy and really beefy. The onion marmalade also provided a nice hint of sweetness. The use of sourdough bread was also a nice touch. I found out later the beef patty is actually made with short rib which probably explains why the texture/density felt kind of 'loose' and not as dense as a regular patty. Feels a little like eating a beef sandwich than a burger but this is a good burger.  BBQ Ribs - This was HUGE. As someone correctly described it online...it looked Fred Flintstone size...haha. Ribs overall were quite nice and tasty. Came off the bone quite easy (bone was close to the length of my forearm) which shows that they had been cooking it slowly for some time. If there's a minor criticism I can make of it is that the meat felt a little 'stringy'. Pretty good.  Pigs and Apples - Read a lot of good reviews about this but sadly ours was overcooked. The minute I put my knife into it I knew this was going to be on the tough side. Flavor profile wise this has potential with the caramelized apples. So sad this dish wasn't executed properly.  Chicken and Waffles - Another dish I looked forward too but was let down. The chicken was definitely on the dry side. Taste was decent but it's just so hard for this dish to recover once the chicken is overcooked. The waffles...were quite pancake-like and floppy which wasn't too my liking. If you want to get good chicken and waffles in Central I suggest giving Green Waffle Diner a go.  Granny Smith Crumble Tart - The crunchiness from the filo dough was nice and I also liked stewed apples inside the tart. Maybe a bit too sweet for my personal tastes but I thought this was a pretty decent dessert.  Charlie Brown - Highly simple but successful dessert in my opinion. The brownie was warm, 'chocolaty' and fudgy which was a nice contrast to the cold ice cream. Best dessert of the night.  Strawberry Shortcake - This came in a cone like cup. Not bad...just didn't really stand out per say. Shortcake provided a nice crunch against the strawberries and cream.  Decent.  My opinion of dinner is there were a few standouts (mussels & burger) but I was expecting more with that kind of a price tag (we paid about $500 each). Honestly speaking, if they hadn't overcooked the pork and also the fried chicken this meal would have been a lot more enjoyable. So after about 2 weeks I went back the other day for lunch since I didn't bring my camera last time. Here is what we ordered (both are set lunches): Mussels With Creamy Fennel Vermouth Broth: Not bad. Flavor was quite subtle and light for a creamy based sauce. Mussels were nicely cooked but I personally preferred the tomato and basil pairing versus this one. The fries were nice but again I'm not sure why they paired mussels with fries. Liberty Burger With Mushrooms and Cheese: I was quite disappointed. The burger felt a little overcook (a little dry) and also it didn't come out at optimal temperature. I understand I took about 20-30 seconds shooting photos but the burger should still be quite hot (which it was not). The burger still tasted pretty decent but the temperature kind of ruined it for me. The fries similar to last time was crunchy and tasty. The set lunches also came with an appetizer and we picked the smoked salmon salad and also a grilled calamari with a chipotle sauce. The chipotle sauce was nice but the actual dishes were quite average and didn't stand out. The calamari was also a little on the tough side. My lunch experience was disappointing and considering it costs us over $200 each I would say this further says to me that Liberty Exchange is overpriced for the food it puts out.  So my overall conclusion is if you go to Liberty Exchange go there for dinner. Get the burger, the mussels, the Charlie Brown and maybe the ribs. Expect to overpay but if they execute the food properly that night I still think it could be an enjoyable meal.

Well, the service was really the highlight of the day, we had our booking from 11:30am to 1:30pm and have confirmed with the restaurant for more than 3 times (indeed a 2-hour brunch is relatively short for kids already but the story hasn't ended), and then at 1255pm, the bill had arrived, we paid and thought we could stay till 1:30pm according to the booking made. However from 1:10pm onward, there were no more drinks served and long faces were seen from all the waitresses when we went out to get food, and we were suddenly told that the booking is till 1pm only and the guests for the next session have already arrived.... Yes, we were kicked out..... In addition, extra pastas ordered from the kids menu were not finished so we asked them to pack them (tried to be environmentally friendly), and what we got was being told very rudely that they don't usually do that and ....$#@*&$^ so we left the restaurant eventually at 1:20pm."", 'Needed to book a quick lunch place in Central on a Friday morning and figured it was Restaurant Week so made a booking online.

Having made a reservation beforehand, we were promptly led to our table.  I was rather surprised to find that the tables were rather packed together.  Apart from a few round tables at the periphery and the centre of the restaurant, the ones that sat 2-4 people were very close together.  One would have to negotiate the 1-foot gaps between the tables to the sitting benches, these gaps were so narrow that they would not be able to accommodate a medium-sized man or a lady with a bulky handbag.  The proximity between the tables would make private conversations very difficult.Between us, we had two 2-course lunches and one 3-course set lunch.  These two are basically the same with the inclusion of an extra main course from the menu in addition to a soup, the harvest buffet and a non-alcoholic drink.  The bread that came first was stale, cold and hard with only a little dish of butter to be shared between the 3 of us.  The carrot soup was lukewarm and bland.  The harvest buffet was basically a salad bar with some cold cuts.  Nothing to write home about.  Adding to the insult, there was some form of salad dressing (only one type available) which seemed ill-fitted to any of the veggies available.I had Bloomberger as the main course.  The meat was mediocre with no flavour whatsoever, I have tasted better meats from fast-food joints.On the plus side, the staff was fairly efficient, the high ceiling and large windows also gave the restaurant a very roomy and airy atmosphere."", ""Was looking for a place to have a nice lunch in Central with the girlfriend, and Bloom came to mind. Arriving at the restaurant, service was slightly on the disappointing end, as it took them quite a few minutes to find my reservation, and once seated, the waiters/waitresses did not seem to be too happy the whole time. Apart from this though, service was alright throughout lunch. (3/5)We quickly chose the 3 course set lunch, which includes a complimentary drink, and both chose the salad bar buffet for our appetizers. The oysters, poached shrimp and smoked salmon were quite fresh, while the elk salad was done quite well. There was also a flavored spinach that I made a second trip for. The rest of the selections were as expected, nothing that blew my mind, but was all decent. Other selections included a sausage and pees salad, truffle flavored eggs, caesar salad, a potato salad, pasta salad and cold cuts. (3/5)Next after the appetizer salad bar, came the soup for the lunch. Today's soup was a Cream of Wild Mushroom. This was very well done, with many soft bits of mushroom in the soup. The cream flavor was strong, but soup was quite liquid. Was very pleased with this. (5/5)For main courses, we selected the Braised Ox-tail and the Truffle Aioli Burger. The ox-tail was quite good, served hot and flavored well in a tomato based sauce. The burger came in a generous portion, but was a tad on the dry side though, and could have done with a little bit more of the Truffle Aioli sauce. The fries on the side were quite well down, crispy on the skin, and soft in the middle. (3/5)Lunch ended with our dessert selection, a Croissant bread pudding with peanut butter fudge, and an Apple Pie. The apple pie was good, but the honorable mention is the bread pudding. The Croissant on top of the bread pudding added a chewier texture to the whole dessert, and the addition of the peanut butter fudge with the usual vanilla sauce made for a very interesting flavoring. Definitely recommend this. (5/5)Overall was quite happy with lunch, and for those who do not want to go full-out and have a 3 course lunch, most of the ala carte selections are priced around $150-$200, and you can also just have the salad bar at $160 (approximate, cannot remember the price).

This restaurant keeps high popularity and reputation among locals and expats since its opening by its 100% handmade pasta, modern dining concept lead by their Italian-American chef, and through recent visit, I learnt more ideas about farm-grown except 'just a place to fill up the stomach'.11Instead of changing the whole space layout, I see more soft changes in the restaurant to be matched with the causal and simple modern style. A cheerful and young feeling is brought out by the restaurant's main color-tone which warms up every one. The dining area is designed smartly to express the fun and the environmental-caring concept which is another key concept that the owner and the chef are willing to express.

It wowed us a lot not only by its huge size, but the attractive pizza top. Special meatball with the kitchen-producted pepperoni were 'printed' on the egg-yellow cheese & bloody tomato sauce layer; fresh herbs and thin slices of mozzarella balanced the flavor as well as the colorful looking. It's thin pizza but not in a super crispy and crunchy way; the heavy cheese and the heat made the huge triangle slice of pizza moisture and melted. It's an intensive taste; mild by the sauce meanwhile appetite-stimulating by the cheesy aroma and spicy sense.3Fragrant Grass Linguini with Parm Fonduta (back) & Fettucine Funghi (front)I became fettucine-lover since my first try in Rome, and I would like to give a 8/10 mark to Linguini Fini's Fettucine Funghi. I have successfully found the right chewiness and eggy aroma from their pasta; the losing 2 points would be counted to the heavy oily taste as my personal judgement. The milky-green color pasta, Fragrant Grass Linguini with parm Fonduta, was ranked as the top 2nd among the 4 pasta dishes we have tried that day. It's a really creamy texture all around the al-dente pasta, a light 'essential' of herb flavor mixed into the creamy-cheesy sauce completely and we could not have too much but tried our best to have more bites, just because of its deliciousness. 1Radiatore alla VodkaTop 1 coming  The Chef plays a game with traditional Italian pasta by adding spicy nduja laced cream sauce; by using this Italian pork spread (nduja) and leveraging the spices of it, the dish impressed us at our first bite immediately; it made your brain memorize this new special taste once your tongue absorbed those 'bio-chemical signals'. 2Apple Caramel Pie2Chocolate Banana CakeThe adding desserts were obviously in a New York style - big size, big taste! The apple pie was the rawest one I have seen in Hong Kong, with largely chopped apple. I love the thin and hard texture of pie with a strong butter aroma. The cake, was not that good-looking to be honest, but to a sweet-lover/chocolate-lover, it is definitely a 'eye-killer'. It tasted just like its melting look, very chocolate & banana in the very fresh way; the banana layer was so fresh that it was like I was having a bite of banana while drinking cold thick chocolate.Supplementary Information* No service charge* Lunch around $150 per head* Dinner around $350 per head* Weekday Happy Hour (5pm - 7pm): All-You-Can-Eat chicken wings & Free-flow PBR (beer)"", ""1Competition in Hong Kong's restaurant market is quite fierce; just by looking into the soho area, we are not that surprised to see the turn-over speed of new restaurants.

The milky-green color pasta, Fragrant Grass Linguini with parm Fonduta, was ranked as the top 2nd among the 4 pasta dishes we have tried that day. It's a really creamy texture all around the al-dente pasta, a light 'essential' of herb flavor mixed into the creamy-cheesy sauce completely and we could not have too much but tried our best to have more bites, just because of its deliciousness. 1Radiatore alla VodkaTop 1 coming  The Chef plays a game with traditional Italian pasta by adding spicy nduja laced cream sauce; by using this Italian pork spread (nduja) and leveraging the spices of it, the dish impressed us at our first bite immediately; it made your brain memorize this new special taste once your tongue absorbed those 'bio-chemical signals'. 2Apple Caramel Pie2Chocolate Banana CakeThe adding desserts were obviously in a New York style - big size, big taste! The apple pie was the rawest one I have seen in Hong Kong, with largely chopped apple. I love the thin and hard texture of pie with a strong butter aroma. The cake, was not that good-looking to be honest, but to a sweet-lover/chocolate-lover, it is definitely a 'eye-killer'. It tasted just like its melting look, very chocolate & banana in the very fresh way; the banana layer was so fresh that it was like I was having a bite of banana while drinking cold thick chocolate.Supplementary Information* No service charge* Lunch around $150 per head* Dinner around $350 per head* Weekday Happy Hour (5pm - 7pm): All-You-Can-Eat chicken wings & Free-flow PBR (beer)"", ""Saturaday we had a family gathering at Linguini Fini because this is the restaurant that my friends highly recommended.when i got in the restaurant, the interior design is just what i like! the warm lightering and relaxing atmosphere. I agree this is a good place to stay during weekend lunch.We have 5 people, but we've ordered over 10 dishes and 1 dessert!This meal is amazing, all of us left the restaurant with smile and bigbelly Caused my brother took the lead to place the order, most dishes I don't know the name...Here I tried list them as much as possible:Salad with slightly grilled Squid: The Romance veggie was so fresh! The texture of squid was special, inside still tasted raw. Overall taste was good.House Cured Salumi, good for serving with wine. Mozzarella with Tomato, mozzarella was homemade and was so good! It's perfect match to be served with tomato. And the texture of mozzarella was just good! Couldn't think of other word to descride this dish. This is one of the favorite I had in this meal.Beet root, very health choice, my mum loves it!Potato Chips, I don't know it's official name. It seems there was maple syrup wrapped on the surface of the chips. It tasted so good, not oily. I could even finish the whole can without any hesitation!Bolognaise with mozzarella cheese baguette, the tomato was fresh, the melted cheese was so good! Pasta with Olives, pasta was homemade (again!), the texture like Chinese noodles with Shanghai style. Pan fried with tomato and Olives, taste healthy.Pizza, we've ordered a mixed of taste~~ Picante & Verdure:Picante - LF mozzarella, homemade sausage, tomato sauce -nice nice nice! Again, the main character is the melted mozzarella!!!Verdure - Smoked scamorza, roasted eggplant sauce, sundried tomato. This was also very good becauseI am big fans of Cheese!The texture of pizza is crispy, and just in right thickness. Served pickled chilies, very nice!The most unforgettable dish - LF Benedict. This was the best one I have had in HK. The nduja hollandaise sauce was the key of this dish. It's in orange tone which is different from others where it's in pale yellow tone. This dish was highly recommended by their staff.The egg was great. Even tough it's very difficult to put everything into mouth, but still worth because the whole dish was so tasty, juice and fresh!Hanger steak & eggs - hanger steak, first time I tasted. Outside of the hanger steak was roasted,inside remainstender. Very nice! And theeggs were organic, nice~ Dessert we had Black berry mousse with ice cream. This was good too. But we were too full, could only order one dessert for all.One more important comment to share. Their service was good. The lady who served our table are so nice. Gave us many suggestions on ordering. Good!!!No doubt I will visit this restaurant again with 00Nice staff~0Nice staff~Mozzarella with tomato, nice!0Mozzarella with tomato, nice!00001LF Benedict, the best I have had in HK0LF Benedict, the best I have had in HKHanger steak1Hanger steakBlack berry dessert~0Black berry dessert~"", ""Linguini Fini has always been one of the pasta places I wanted to try out. On a weekly lunch get together with a  friend, we decided to try it out. Located inside the L Place, it's a pretty big restaurant with lots of tables. We made a reservation anyways so we dont have to wait. We both decided to try out the three course set lunch($118) which comes with either a soup or salad or an appetizer (8 hr tripe),  then a choice of their signature pasta or grilled beef tongue, followed with a drink and a cookie for dessert. I chose the Roasted pepper & eggplant soup for appetitzer. The soup tasted like a tomato base soup with a hints of roasted pepper flavoring. I think the eggplant just give a little thickness to the soup but you can't really taste the eggplant. The soup was light and very refreshing to drink. Although I would prefer it a little bit more smooth, I think it's a good soup overall. 0Then for the entree, I chose the classic linguini fini. It's basically a fresh made tomato sauce tossed in pasta. I like how you can tell the sauce is freshly made because there are chunks of tomatoes in it and it has the tangy tomato flavor rather than your store bought tomato sauce aroma. The pasta is cooked al dente which is the chewier pasta. The pasta was good, but it wasn't amazing. I wish there are more components to add a little bit more depth to the dish rather than just simple tomato sauce with no surprises. I got bored eating it when I was half way through the dish. 0After we were done with the entree, we ordered iced tea to end our meal. But the service was so bad that we waved down 3 different people to check on our drink order and we still didn't get our drink after 20 minutes. Finally, a waiter checked the computer and realized our order was never placed! So the drink came out very quickly after the order was placed. Then, we had to ask the waiter to bring out our cookies quickly since we waited so long for the drinks already. But it took them another 10 minutes just to pull out some already made cookies to the table.  Good thing the cookies were pretty delicious peanut butter cookies so I was less angry at the situation. 0Supplementary InformationSet lunch is only &98 for tables out by 12:30pm"", ""I had lunch here with a friend, we both had the $88 lunch set which was a pasta dish and a drink.  I had the puttanesca, my friend had the Pomodori - both arrived quickly and we were offered cheese or black pepper immediately.  The pasta was perfectly as dente, perhaps a little too so for my liking, and the sauces both strong in flavour.  A puttanesca sauce is often in danger of being too salty with capers, olives and anchovies, but this one was well seasoned.  The bread was also very fresh and had good flavour.I would come here for a casual work lunch again (with colleagues, not with a client i was trying to impress) but probably would avoid for dinner as it's quite a loud place and just off the lobby of the building so the view is a queue of people."", ""I have been to Linguini Fini for dinner twice and quite like the place. I had been thinking about bringing my family over, but was held back because they didn't accept reservation before. Now that they do, I had to bring them there.Linguini Fini extended to the ground floor where Cantopop was before, possibly due to the high demand at rush hour. The manager said they are still seeking a location for Cantopop. The reception also moved to the ground floor, so approach the receptionist on the ground floor for your table instead! (So you won't end up like me bringing my whole family into the lift and came back out since we did not have access to the floor. *blush)0Once the escalator doors opened, you will see a nice bar area with a long wooden table and red long coach. Further inside are lots of squared tables and sofa booths with comfortable spacing. There are also a semi-opened kitchen area where several dishes are placed. If you look around the dinning area, you will see lots of graphics painted on the walls, which are masterpieces by local artist Start From Zero. If you pay more attention while walking around in HK and Macau, you will probably see a lot of theirs designs too. I also like the banker lamp on the sofa booth area, which makes things more classy. There were also casual music playing at the background to accompany your food. All in all, the ambiance was pretty nice.0Service was as usual nice and friendly. The server brought us a menu of the day on a wooden chalk board, and we ordered cold cuts as my dad loves it alot. My server, an Asian who couldn't speak chinese, made my parents wonder if non-english speakers are welcomed to the restaurant. I would think its a good opportunity for him to at least try learning since he is working in Asia anyways?0LF Salumi PlatterLonza (Left) - Cured loin that was mildy salty and sweet. Quite nice!bresaola (Right) - Glossy cured beef that was rubbery textured and not quite salty, most boring among the four.Finocchiona (Far Back) - Cured loin that was spicy, salty and fatty but yum. The texture was rubbery if cmoared to Picante.Picante (Front) - Glossy cured loin that has the same spiciness as Finocchiona but also less salty and fatty.0Picante Pizza $128 (7/10)The pizza was quite delicious. The crust was crispy at the rim but soft in the middle. The tomato taste was very strong and sweet, and paired well with the lightly tasted mozarella buffalo. The Picante was too little to give enough taste to the pizza though. Anyhow, I was quite nice.0Dried Shrimp Diavola Linguine $88 (10/10)Love this linguine to the max, its simply splendid. Of course the linguine was cooked al dente, but the most excellent part was the savoury tomato sauce. Imagine every mouth full was filled with a strong shrimp and tomato taste with mild spiciness and al dente linguine. How great was that!0LF Benedicts $98 (5/10)The dish was crazily orangy, I have never seen hollandaise sauce that organy before. The poached egg was nicely made with semi-solid whites and running orangy yolk. The egg tasted really lovely with sweet and creamy yolk, i wonder where they source them from.  The 'Nduja replaced the traditional bacon but was not salty enough in my own opinion. The Hollandaise sauce tasted nice with slight spiciness, but was a bit too much. Not only had it overpowered the natural taste of the egg and 'Nduja, it also soften the muffin too. I was a bit disappointed.00FINAL COMMENTS...Lunching at Linguini Fini is a totally different dinning experience from dinning at night. It is more relaxing during the day, but more energetic at dinner hour which loud music is played. I think it would be better to bring family at lunch and friends at dinner hour, since most parents hate place that are loud and noisy?FOOD RECOMMENDED- LF Salumi Platter- Picante Pizza- Dried Shrimp Diavola Linguini                Supplementary Information- Make reservation in advance is recommended."", ""Had lunch with a big groups of friends in this new Italian restaurantSince we were looking for an easy and quick lunch, we all went for lunch sets.A few of us ordered its home-made linguini fini and some ordered another pasta dish. For the price of HK$98 (including bread, a salad, a pasta and drink, but no service charge), the lunch set seems to be a bargain.The texture of linguini fini was quite interesting. Yet, it tasted very salty (a common comment by all the friends). My friend who ordered another pasta dish said it was burnt and tasted average.Service-wise, they missed out our orders. We waited for over 20 mins to have our pasta served after we finished the salad. That's a luxury for lunch! Overall, i see a big room for improvement for the lunch here. I doubt if i will return to try its ala carte menu."", ""Overall not an impressive experience but the staff's great service attitude is worth mentioning!Waiting... and Waiting...  1) I don't come to Central for lunch often so while being here, I do want to try something new and different! Since I was craving for pasta, I've decided to give this restaurant a try. I went there at 11:30 and was informed politely that the restaurant would be opened at noon. The waitstaff asked if I'd like to have a drink first but I said I'll come back later.Coming back at 12noon and customers started piling up at the waiting area because the restaurant was still not ready as the staff were being briefed... (I do appreciate the professionalism, but if you tell your customer your restaurant will open at 12, shouldn't the briefing be done BEFORE that?). Actually, waited for almost 20minutes before being seated!!  It kinda made you feel you were being forgotten as there's no organised way of sitting the guests who have been waiting for a while and those who were just arriving! Atmosphere Quite casual, relaxing and friendly... the setting actually made you feel at ease. I quite like their stools at the waiting area which resembled a tin can (with the company logo of course). The background music (I assume Jazz?) was matching to the modern setting. It was quite crowded over lunchtime though.0Menu I was quite surprised that there was no lunch or drink menu until you asked... then the waiter would bring a HUGE piece of blackboard and explained to you about the Set Lunch (poor them... that thing looked quite inconvenient to carry). Though it's a nice gesture, I do think it'll be more pleasant if you actually present BOTH normal menu and lunch menu... otherwise the poor waiter will just be holding the large piece of blackboard while guests are struggling with options and checking back with main menu to check out the ingredients in selective pasta...Service From beginning to end, service was excellent! There seemed to be a good number of staff attending to guests' needs. Staff were attentive, responsive and polite, which this was the one consistent thing! They took initiative to top up water and check with you to see if the food was okay or if you need more cheese or pepper. Service staff were efficient and when they saw you have been waiting for main course for a long time, they would take initiative to check for you and let you know when it would be coming. FoodFood was just average... I ordered a Linguini Funghi Set lunch...1) At first I chose the minestrone instead of salad... this was what I got:0Oil spill in the soup >.<When I took the first sip... heavy layer of oil swamping around the tomatoes. Maybe the staff saw my horrid expression and did check with me if the soup was okay... and explained that the oil's there to enhance the flavour. He pleasantly offered to change it into salad if I were not pleased with it. It was bit disappointing because I could see good tomatoes in there... but totally spoiled by the excessive olive oil spill!Salad0Salad was a much pleasant find! The flavour was simple but mixed to a good acidity that appealed to your taste bud. The leaves were fresh and the tomatoes were juicy  2) the Pasta0It eventually came after a very long wait (around 40min?) and somehow was served warm instead of hot. I don't know why there seemed to be many staff around in the kitchen but it took them very long time to cook...Overall it's just average. The texture of the pasta was good and to my liking but the flavour was bit too salty. There was no rich sauce or anything but it was just plain salty. Not a lot of mushrooms but fair enough... but few pieces were a bit bitter. Could've been nicer if they use fresh button mushroom as well.3) The tea0OMG, did they wash the cup?! There were STAINS inside and outside the cup. This photo was actually taken before any tea was poured in!! Immediately the staff attended to me and apologetically changed the cup for me but it was disgusting!0It's nice that they served the tea and lemon separately but they seriously need to review the size of the tea cup. It might be perfect for coffee but too small indeed for tea (esp when two slices of lemon were stuck in there)!I guess this is a new restaurant and things are just starting to pick up?! I can see the seriousness and sincerity of the owner trying to make this a good restaurant. hopefully the overall experience is more pleasant next time!""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-linguini-fini/190645?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

Since the card said you would get 1 free lunch set after getting 4 stamps, so I was very confused why not all the 3 stamps were on 1 card instead. The waitress argued that originally each person should have 1 card, so they were already not giving us 3 cards as planned. We were even more confused as there was nothing similar written on the card to indicate such rule and we felt like being cheated. Her explanation couldn't stand itself either. We didn't really care about the stamps and the free lunch, but it was not a good practice to treat your customers.

402,Lobster Bobo by Eddy,Central,Chinese,3.7,90.0,0.0,"My husband and I were looking somewhere quick to eat before my son's playgroup. I suddenly remembered this place so we hurriedly went in around 1:45pm. Luckily the lunch crowd was almost gone because we had a baby, it would've been quite annoying for other diners if it was packed (which I'm sure it is at normal the lunch hour). We ordered the rich lobster bisque udon ($120) and the lobster cheong fun ($68). The udon came really quickly, the ladies were really considerate, giving us extra bowls and placing the hot soup away from my baby. At first glance, there was a substantial amount of lobster on top (awesome), with other garnishes (can't remember what else apart from corn) and a lobster oil (I think). The lobster bisque was thick and creamy, packed with flavour, we (including my son) enjoyed it immensely. I had a bit of the lobster, it was tender and not overcooked, which is easy to do especially when it's in a hot broth. Portion was good, my husband couldn't finish the noodles. The cheong fun came much later. I was wondering what took so long, as I assumed it would just be pre-steamed cheong fun with a lobster sauce on it. It came with bits of lobster (not the big chunks like in the udon but it's only $68! what did you expect?) and shrimp/lobster roe. They even had roe on the table so you can help yourself to more. I like the generousity, even though I didn't add any. I took a bite and I realised why it took so long. The cheong fun wasn't just steamed, they were lightly fried so they had a slight crispiness to it. Very enjoyable, I ate it all as my husband wasn't interested. If I were to be picky then I'd say it was a little bit oily and heavy together with the sauce, so it would be good to add something to cut through the richness.At a time where dining out is crazy expensive, I think Lobster Bobo's food is worth its value. Service was good, even though there wasn't a service charge. I mean a $120 for a soup noodle lunch isn't cheap by any means but this is lobster! In Central! I would definitely come back again if I was feeling rich that day haha. I'm keen to try the rice in lobster broth next time.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-lobster-bobo-by-eddy/452611?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
403,Lobster Central,Causeway Bay,American,3.1,151.0,0.0,"Recently, Lobster Central is offering a lunch set for $99 that includes three mini rolls and a drink. The rolls are lobster, crab and shrimp. As I've only tried the lobster roll, I was curious about their other ones so this was a pretty good chance to do so.I suppose the worst of the three rolls is the shrimp roll. It was bland, grossly under seasoned. The shrimp tasted rubbery. The lobster roll I've had before and it reminded me that I wasn't wrong the first time around. It was an ok roll but not great. Just not buttery enough. But the best roll was the crab roll. So, word on the street was right. The crab roll is the best. The seasoning was spot on. The crab was sweet and tasty.0For three small rolls and a drink, this was a pretty decent deal for lunch. Though for people with larger appetites, this may not be enough. But it was pretty good. for the price."", ""When Lobster Central first opened in Central, word on the street said they were Hong Kong's first legit lobster roll. I went and tried it and thought ... yeah. Pretty good. Nice and buttery. Exactly what it's all about.Recently, they have opened their second branch. This time in Causeway Bay's Tang Lung Street. As I live near here than Central, I came here for lunch.Shop, though small, is larger than the Central branch as there are more seats. Just like their Central branch, you pay (cash only, no 10% service charge) at the cashier and they will bring the food to you when ready.Menu is in English only. It appears to be the same except they now offer add on options. So you can have a soup/fries option and make it like an actual meal. Previously, they only offered this by offering half a roll But to me I thought .. I don't want half a lobster roll! Now they give you the option of adding it with a whole roll! YIPEE for this change!2I ordered a lobster roll ($138) with an soup and slaw upgrade ($65).0The soup was a lobster bisque. Sadly, it wasn't too good. A bit too grainy and too creamy in taste. Not much lobster flavor as well. Probably due to the fact they over dosed it in cream.0The slaw was a bit too watery. It did have a nice crunch and had that bit of tang that I like but it was just dripping in liquid. I have no idea why.0Of course, here is the lobster roll. I don't know if it's this place of they changed their recipe completely but it's not as buttery as before. In Central, it was like buttery goodness. This was a bit on the dry side. The lobster was also chewy and definitely overcooked. Now I wonder if the rumors are true. That the crab roll is better than the lobster roll? I guess I'll have to try it out next time to confirm.0Lobster Central now has stiff competition in Causeway Bay with Hungry Lobster (who personally, I think does a better lobster roll and lobster bisque for a lower price). But it's still a good option for me if I want a little fast food seafood. I will be back to check out the crab roll as people have told me that is what is better. So, yeah ... will be back.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-lobster-central/512017?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
404,Lobster Central,Central,American,3.6,179.5,0.0,"Environment: 4/5It is a very slim but long hipster place...which is only for young people with good spinal cords because most of the chairs are bar chairs without back supports.Inner decor of Lobster Central0Inner decor of Lobster CentralThere are only two real tables allowing you and your friends to chat face-to-face. If you are not lucky or early enough to get those real tables - you need to sit side-to-side with your friends, facing a rough, factory-style concrete wall. If you are a little luckier, you can get window bar seats - but ladies have to be aware of their dresses.Food:My friends and I shared two rolls - lobster and crab - which the fillings were wrapped with the same type of bread. Speaking of the buns which wrapped fillings, they warm, and amazingly crispy and thin.Upon request, the bun could be cut into two halves.Lobster Roll $138 - 3/5Lobster Roll$ 1380Lobster Roll$ 138Drizzled with (too much) lemon butter and (overly) favored with spices, the freshness(or the taste) of juicy lobster was covered a big time - the original taste of lobster couldn\'t be found until I had chewed four to five bites. But the texture of the lobster told me that it was fresh and lovely - just that my taste bud couldn\'t tell.Crab Roll $118 - 5/5Crab Roll $ 1180Crab Roll $ 118Like most of the critics say, crab roll is a lot better than the lobster roll. Topped above the crispy warm bun was the creamy and juicy crab melt. To me, it was more like a salad mixture without vegetable. This time, the taste of crab wasn\'t covered by all sort of favours - but complemented just well by all sort of ...fatty...creamy...sauce.Earl Grey tea : $20 - 5/5I didnt really pay attention to the brand of tea bags used but speaking of the quality and the price - I, as a tea lover, liked it.Service:You need to pay first at the cashier but then they will send the food to your table.Waiting time:I didn\'t have to wait when I entered the place at 12:40 on a Thursday. So it is also a good place for hipster colleagues gathering.Verdict:For first timers, just grab a friend with you and share two buns of two favours so that you will know what you like. But personally, I love the crab roll more although ""Lobster Central"" is its name.', 'There is something about lobster that makes me stop in my tracks. And lobster rolls is pretty much a quick fix for those days when you can\'t do a little full blown lobster dinner. It seems to be the ""It"" food of the moment. I mean, if you go to Canada, the east coast McD\'s has McLobster. That\'s how trendy it\'s become when McDonald\'s gets in on the game.Lobster rolls originated in the east coast of USA, most notably New England. They are traditionally served in a hotdog bun that is sliced down the top, all buttered up. Served with a side of fries or potato chips. It\'s the ultimate street food. Once you have one, you dream of having another.There are a few places in Hong Kong that serve lobster rolls: Master Kama, Pop It, Mama Burger & Lobster ... just to name a few. The latest to enter this world is Lobster Central. A small shop located in ... yes, as the name states, Central.Menu is in English only. There is no 10% service charge. You pay (cash only) at the cashier and wait for your order to be brought to you. They serve not only lobster rolls but also crab rolls and shrimp rolls. Fries are not part of the package but you can order it as a side. They do have a combo set that includes a lobster bisque and half a roll for $150.I, however, wasn\'t keen on eating HALF a lobster roll. No way! I was here to gorge on the whole thing! No weak halves for me.One lobster roll. Price? $138. Size? Not big. But it was enough for me to at least be not too full to have a little dessert elsewhere later. This was fairly good lobster roll. The bun was buttered. Actually, the whole lobster tasted buttery and glorious. I appreciated that the whole bun was filled with lobster meat and nothing else. No strange addition of salad bits (like Coffee Alley did). It was just biting into lobster meat and a buttered bun. I read past reviews where people found cartilage in theirs. I didn\'t find that in mine. Perhaps they read reviews and have improved on this by removing the cartliage.1Pretty good lobster roll. Best in town? Well ... will be going through the rest of my list to find out if it is. But for the mean time, not bad at all. And close enough for me to give it another go.', ""Legit Crab Rolls at Lobster Central!  Trust me. Order the crab rolls which came more recommended to me than their signature lobster roll! I've been hearing a lot about this small restaurant located on Stanley Street and went for a lunch with Coco! I guess other people also felt that same buzz because fellow friend and awesome food blogger Patrick Lai was also there!Crab Roll and Lobster Roll - THE CRAB ROLL !!!!0Crab Roll and Lobster Roll - THE CRAB ROLL !!!!Coco ordered the Lobster Roll, I went with the Crab Roll (the one that was heavily recommended) as well as drinks, truffle fries and a lobster bisque to share!!

The lobster bisque was a bit on the under seasoned side but I still finished every single slurp.CRAB ROLL!!!0CRAB ROLL!!!Oh right, lets get back to the best thing about Lobster Central. The exquisite crab roll. The crab melt was creamy, juicy and chock full of flavor! The toasted buns perfectly encased all of that delectable crab meat. My only regret was not ordering more of this and not having a big enough stomach to eat more of it.Sampler Platter0Sampler PlatterPatrick had a huge meal all by himself. He had the sampler which featured a crab roll, lobster roll and included a shrimp roll as well. Looking forward to coming back and getting the crab roll again."", ""0I love that you can be wandering around a part of town that you thought you knew well, but realised that you didn't. I had this feeling when walking down Stanley Street in Central a couple of weeks ago, where I noticed a new little 'hole-in-the-wall' restaurant that was right up my alley.I'd developed a real taste for lobster rolls when visiting New York a few years back (see post here) and have been lowly tracking down all of the dining spots that have lobster rolls on their menus. You can imagine my surprise and delight when I stumbled across a spot that specialised in lobster rolls!Deciding that I'd check it out for lunch one day, I made a beeline for Lobster Central and discovered that the little hole-in-the-wall spot was a lot bigger than I'd first noticed. There was room for about twenty or so diners to sit down and enjoy the simple joy of a lobster roll.The menu at Lobster Central is pretty short and to the point, which is really what the team are trying to achieve, with a view to stripping down the roll to it's 'most naked form'. What does that mean you might ask? Well, it means that the lobster rolls at Lobster Central are stripped down and dressed minimally - there is a brioche bread roll, lobster and a light coating of a house made lemon butter with a secret spice mix. No fancy salad and a generous amount of lobster.0While the humble lobster roll is the key focus of Lobster Central, there are a couple of other options available should you not (shock horror) like lobster rolls. There's also a crab roll and a shrimp roll available, but really, if you're not into lobster rolls, then you're probably going to avoid a place that's sole purpose for existing is producing the 'quintessential' lobster roll experience. There's also a couple of sides available, such as lobster bisque, slaw and truffle fries, and for the adventurous diners, there are combo deals that include a mix'n match of different rolls.I'd timed my visit to Lobster Central perfectly, arriving about ten minutes prior to a rush that saw a line out the door, so I had a comfy seat right at the front that let me do a little people watching as I waited for my meal to arrive. My choice for the day? Well, it would be no surprise that I'd gone for the lobster roll, the lobster bisque and some of the truffle fries. But what did I think?Let's start off with the good. For lobster roll purists, there's plenty for you to love about Lobster Central, with plenty of delicious lobster meat stuffed into a light brioche roll. The light drizzle of lemon butter was perfect with the sweet flesh of the lobster, and the secret seasoning was interesting. From a sizing perspective, the lobster rolls are reasonably small, so you could easily go for two of them if you were feeling particularly hungry.00The truffle fries were also very good, although thin cut in style, the fries were cooked well and had a golden crunchy outer. I could smell the truffle salt on the fries but the taste was quite subdued and mild, so I'd have preferred a little punchier hit of truffle.0Now, the bad. I'd ordered the lobster bisque and it was far from what I'd consider to be an acceptable bisque, and in fact, about the only thing that was right about it was it's deep red colouring. I found the bisque to be really thin and watered down, with a flavour that was not far off inedible. It came out so hot that I couldn't really try it until after I'd finished my lobster roll and fries. When I could finally have a sip, I almost spat it out. 1The other element that was disappointing was the cartilage that was still in the lobster in my roll, and not just one piece of cartilage or shell, but numerous. It actually detracted from what would have otherwise been the 'perfect' lobster roll - by that I mean most like the great lobster rolls I was devouring all over Manhattan. Removing the shell and cartilage from the lobster is the basic tenant of serving a lobster roll and has to be right - every.single.time!Lobster Central is a funky little spot that's decked out semi industrial and with room for about twenty diners at a time. Most of the seats are bench style, but there are a couple of tables set out for groups of four right at the back, so if you're early enough, you could get along with a couple of mates for lunch. I loved the music being played while I was people watching and munching on my lunch, but the speaker was right next to me at the front of the dining area, so I'd love to see the speaker installed in the walls - otherwise it would be hard to have a conversation with your dining companion.I'll definitely get along to Lobster Central as one of my regular lunch time spots, but I will be avoiding the bisque and probably just getting a couple of the lobster rolls. That is, as long as my next visit is fault free! @FoodMeUpScotty0The lobster rolls are not huge1But they are packed full of the good stuff!0I loved this bottle of pure New Zealand volcanic water!0Semi industrial feel with the exposed brick and tube lighting0Bigger than I initially thought, there was room for twenty in the dining area0Worth checking out - Stanley Street""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-lobster-central/480752?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

The concept looked promising and I like the tea museum exhibition, so I booked a lunch table and we were seated immediately upon arrival  (to bring up another story that I had to bail on my 1st attempt to come here due to work blowing up, and they were very nice about me canceling the appointment afterwards) ENVIRONMENT:entrance0entranceLooks very  which was cute, but AC was on way too low and there was mosquitos and ants everywhere  Especially after drinking hot tea, we were dying to leave...

Especially at the price level, for 80/person lunch I expected at least being full, but all of us ended up buying sushi from international 2 hours later because the portion were so small and not appetizing"", 'Hong Kong is a busy and noisy city. So to have a vegetarian dim sum restaurant decorated in traditional Chinese style inside Hong Kong Park is a real sanctuary. But I have known this secret place for a long time and taken many people there for their first time.Vegetarian dim sum are generally not very tasty food items because of the limitations, so Lock Cha is very clever to focus on teas. There are about 10 types of teas and each person can pick their own, have their own teacups with lids to steep their tea properly. On the table, there is an electric kettle with boiling water that customers can add anytime themselves. We were there for me to present my friend with the birthday cake that I had made for her. The cake only took a few hours but the decorates took a total of 15 hours as they were made from hard sugar icing and I made about 8 types of different flowers and a bluebird of happiness.So back to the food at the restaurant. We each ordered a different type of tea. There were about 15 choices of dim sum and 3 of us. We chose about 10 types as some names do not really describe what they are, so all we know was that they are dim sum and vegetarian. Please see photos as I have forgotten most of the very pretty names. The best dish was fried turnip cake, so good I had no time to take a photo before it was all gone. We ordered a second plate but that also went before photo time. This is a great restaurant for tea lovers who are small eaters as there are no big dishes. Even the daily noodle or rice dish is a tiny portion. The food is healthy though as it is not oily and not many dishes are deep fried.If you are in the park and want a nice place to relax.

It wasn't too sweet and the bun wasn't overflowing with custard!Price here is very good as well with dim sum ranging between $15 per dish to $30.  The tea here is very expensive though at the price of $25 each.  I would definitely come here again!  Service is also not too bad even though the waiters seemed to forget what we ordered.

406,Lucky Star,Causeway Bay,Chinese,2.7,66.0,0.0,"I've been to Lucky Star on several occasions since they always give a $6 discount coupon after every time I dine there. So, on this day, I decided to again use the discount coupon and I noticed a change. The name is now called Chee Kei Lucky Star.Some time this month, the Chee Kei () in Causeway Bay closed. I assume due to the lack of business from tourists as the wonton noodle place was very popular with tourists, it had closed. But apparently not. Lucky Star was the cha chan teng concept of Chee Kei. I guess they decided to just merge the two concepts together.The menu is in English and Chinese. There is no 10% service charge. Gone are many of the cha chan teng items along with the Hong Kong style take on Japanese food. In it's place was wonton noodles. They did keep a few cha chan teng items. Things like the pineapple bun. But it is now mostly wonton noodles.0If you think the lunch set is expensive, the afternoon tea set is not as pricey but then it seems it's not a lot of food compared to other places.0I decided to go with the lunch set of wonton noodles and one dim sum ($65). It came with a drink. Dim sum choice was found on the bottom of the menu.The noodles were ok. Chewy but lacked bounce. The wontons were ok. The skin was thin but the filling wasn't impressive. But what disappointed me was the soup. The old Chee Kei had an excellent wonton soup base. A delicate broth that had a strong shrimp taste. This one? It just tasted like pepper. So much pepper was added to this, it covered all the flavor.0For the dim sum, I chose the fried fish balls. These were pretty good. I didn't detect any small bones as most places grind the bones with the meat. The oyster sauce for dipping was great. Very salty with a good pungent taste.0I did love Chee Kei. It was one of the favorites I used to go to before the tourists took over and I was not keen on waiting in line for a table. But now that I've had it here, I wonder if the wonton noodles quality had decreased or was it just bad here? It wasn't cheap so probably won't be back. But then they gave me another discount voucher."", ""While heading out for lunch before work, I discovered a new place that opened recently. Always up for trying new places, I headed in.

However, when I got to the bottom of my bowl, the rice was soggy.1I decided to add $10 for a green tea ice cream. It comes after you are finished your meal. The ice cream melted pretty fast. The taste had a very light green tea flavor. It wasn't very strong at all. It was more like green tea candy. The ice cream wasn't very smooth as well. It was a bit icy. I don't think I'd order it again.2Upon leaving, I was given a $6 coupon for next time. So, I guess there will be a next time?0The food was ok. Not great.

All arrived freshly prepared and mighty quick! There is exquisite technique shown by the dim sum chefs in both the presentation and taste of each dish. The fact the technique needs to be duplicated with monotonous regularity adds, rather than detracts, from the greatness.Here the char siu bao is classically fluffy, with a nice and hot filling of juicy barbecue pork. The har gow are almost overflowing with succulent prawns in a glutinous wrapper that tastes as pretty as it looks. There is an ease about Luk Yu.We finish with egg tarts and oven baked peach cakes. The egg tarts have flaky pastry that catches the sweet egg filling. I try not ordering them all the time because I can\'t stop at one. The ""cakes"" are oddly described, but taste incredible.

409,Lung Moon Restaurant,Wan Chai,Chinese,3.1,100.0,,"Like almost everyone at Lung Moon today, we were here to bid farewell to this long surviving restaurant. We got together 8 of us determine to try out all the dishes they had to order. A few of us have been here before but a few were here for the first time. Although we booked 2 weeks ago and confirmed the booking again only yesterday, we arrived to find we had no table. It was chaotic too with people taking photos everywhere, crowded around tables and grabbing Dim Sum from the steam trolleys. After about 10 minutes when I had given up, our 2 men found a table where a party had left and right under the backdrop sign for weddings in the middle of the room, so we were relieved that we were to get lunch.We ordered a plate of char siu and roast goose as that was recommended by previous reviews. My colleague thought pregnant woman fried rice sounds fun and the waiter recommended for our vegetarian colleague the dry fried e fu noodles. With that out of the way, we took turns in twos to raid the dim sum trolleys. Basically, we took whatever types of dim sum they had at any time. So Har gau, siu mai, beef balls, steam chive dumplings, duck web wraps, chickens' feet, steam tripe, bean curd rolls, ma lai go, spare ribs and most importantly, the giant buns. I had never tried a giant bun and cut into the first one to share. Inside was chicken, pork, salted egg yolk and mushroom in my quarter. I could happily eat one of these and be full but I had to leave space to try other things. Char Siu and roast goose was very good. The Char siu is charcoal grilled and not very burnt but smelt nicely of roast meat and I liked the roast goose more than that of Yung Kee's as the skin was crispy and shiny. I had quite a few pieces Dry fried e fu noodles was nice with lots of straw mushrooms, very dark in colour, dry and not oily and flavoursome, I had more than a bowl. Pregnant woman fried rice was a disappointment when it arrived. It was white with bits of vegetables in it. When we tasted it, it was egg white, vegetable bits with ginger which tasted better than it looked but nothing like the same name dish at Xi Yin which has black olives and is almost black in colour. This dish ended up suitable for our vegetarian colleague too. We wanted to try some fried or baked dim sums but despite walking up and down all 3 floors, none of the dim sum stations had any. Likewise for dessert, there was only ma lai go and red bean bun. The Ma Lai Go came in a big steam basket like a giant cake cut up. It wasn't as dark in colour as some restaurants but tasted really nice. Pure and refreshing and not too sweet.  Our vegetarian colleague had one of the 2 red bean paste buns and said it was good but it made her too full.I had no idea how much food cost in this restaurant and had rung earlier to ask if they take credit cards. They said yes for bills above $200 but when I went to pay (yes, you have to go up to the cashier counter), they said cash only. Luckily, it only came to $760.We can at least say we have tried many dishes and dim sums at Lung Wah in the last week of its existence and most of the dishes were above average or good. Understand that with this type of management, service and decor, it was a clever decision to sell the building which could feed the owner for generations.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/wan-chai-lung-moon-restaurant/1973?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

I am like huh??? we never get anything and no one at all following up our main courses at all- not withstanding all the mistakes made, at the time of paying bills, the waiter still 'emphasize' that there is a tips section on the credit bill for waiter. just improve the service will make the whole package much much better."", 'The interior design and atmosphere is attractively done, to convey the feeling of an Italian building with a chunky timbered ceilings, there is also a very attractive outdoor gallery area which would be nice for drinks. The service was efficient friendly and impeccable. The buffet lunch is very nice with a good spread of Italian dishes both meat, fish and vegetarian so plenty of options for all diners. Sadly the main courses were not up to scratch for expensive restaurant, the chicken was over cooked and dry. The fish was OK however the vegetables with it were bitter. The desert buffet was nice with nice selection of typical dishes including Tiramisu. Lunch was followed with a cappuccino which was at first bitter but was smoother as it was drunk, however in these days gourmet coffees the barista could have either put a pattern or made a tidier top the coffee, it gave one the impression it had bee rushed. Overall a great buffet with great deserts, but skip the main course which was underwhelming to say the least given the price!', 'Nice place, prime location but quality of food can fluctuate.This restaurant has caught my attention quite some time ago but only now have I dared to brave the mixed reviews and sample what Lupa has to offer at lunch time.Decor and AmbienceDepending on where you sit, the ambience and the dining experience can vary quite a bit. Upon being greeted at the concierge, you are escorted along a corridor, with half-circle sofa tables on your left. If your seat is not one of those, there are quite a number of cafe tables and chairs in the main dining area. Rather clustered too. As people filled in the main dining area, the din can be quite affective if you\'re trying to strike a healthy conversation. There it feels like a noisy cafe or canteen. However if you were seated in the sofa tables along the corridor, as we were, the ambience is a bit classier and more private.FoodI\'ve heard about the brunch buffet on weekends, but I didn\'t do my research thoroughly to investigate what they actually offer for lunch. (Or it wasn\'t immediately obvious from the first few pages of reviews on Openrice, no matter). For lunch on weekdays, most people would probably go for the lunch buffet which includes some selection of starters, salads, soup and dessert, plus a limited selection of pasta/pizza/mains with additional charge of up to $90. The basic lunch buffet was $188 or so, FYI.If you were more particular about food or can\'t be bothered to share the lunch buffet with us ""commoners"" you are welcome to choose a la carte from their lunch menu. I suspect this menu differs from their dinner menu, but should offer enough variety in any case.From the salad bar0From the salad barIn my honest opinion I do not think their salad bar is half bad. As compared to Gold by Harlan, or Bloom, the salad bar Lupa offers a more fullsome variety including seared tuna, some decent parma ham among other cold cuts, salmon, seasoned aubergines, pesto pasta salad, cubes of cold quiche, olives etc. (8/10 - the way salad bar goes)Seafood penne0Seafood penneOur meal was going fine until this penne. Quite disappointed to find it lacking heat, which is quite a no no for seafood (frozen) obviously. The pasta was probably homemade, which is encouraging but also gives for less quality control I believe. The textureis unlike any other penne I\'ve had, it\'s almost crispy, crunchy. Which is so unconventional for pasta and penne....Not sure what to make of this.It\'s not your usual al dente, nor was it uncooked. (6.5/10)Gnocchi with oxtail ragout and ricotta cheese0Gnocchi with oxtail ragout and ricotta cheeseI really like this dish and so would you if you, like me, love pasta sauce more than pasta, as well as comfort food like mac n cheese. A critic would probably say the proportion of oxtail ragout vs gnocchi is a bit too much, indeed there is as much oxtail meat/sauce as there are gnocchi. But that\'s fine with me I like wet and soft foods. Thesoftness is another thing that strikes me. The gnocchi probably shouldn\'t have been so soft as baby mush...but I liked it for what it was. At least it\'s got individuality lol. (8/10)DessertNeglected to take pictures of the bit size cakes and desserts from the buffet table. Nothing worth noting anyway. But I do appreciate the cheeses they had. (7/10)ServiceTheir service was quite good and professional. Exceeds the quality of the food in fact. Keep it up!', 'The Sunday brunch offered at about $400 each is quite a bargain, considering the food quality, the location and the ambience. With $200 more you get free-flow wine and the likes.Although for someone like me who is looking for authentic, decent pasta and pizza might be slightly disappointed.at the buffet table0at the buffet tableat the buffet table0at the buffet tableat the buffet table0at the buffet tableSome snapshots of the buffet table.I have no complaints about the range of food choices and the quality.Seafood was fresh and of decent quality for semi-buffet. The Italian specialities namely proscuitto cotto / crudo or cheeses or rucola were within reasonable range of tastiness.I was amazed by the polenta with stewed oxtail topped with fresh mushroom, mixed at the last minute with melted (though it was more like a show) parmigiano. I am generally not impressed with western stewed dishes, but I couldn\'t resist second helping.00The polenta was honestly not a satisfactory finish, but the stewed oxtail saved its honour.There were 2 soup choices (tomato with octopus and cream of mushroom if I remember correctly) and grilled pork loin, which was pink in the centre and unexpectedly tender at the buffet table.0The aperol drink mix gave a beautiful color complementing the comfy atmostphere.0The best dish of the day aside from the oxtail was this so it deserves its own big shot. Eggs were of good quality and cooked to perfection.The biggest disappointment was the ordered pasta and pizza.I have tried several times there before I reached this conclusion.Don\'t get me wrong, the pasta tasted fine but it was simply not that Italian. Perhaps I should remind myself that this place came from New York.The tomato sauce was lack of delicacy and the right balance of sourness and sweetness.0The pizza base was delicious, though the filling and the tomato sauce were again a disappointment.I still cannot grasp the logic of putting shitake mushroom onto a funghi pizza. The other time we were served with something like this. The ""aroma"" of the shitake mushroom was simply too overwhelming and we gave up the pizza filling at the end.This time we went for capriciosa pizza (as it claimed itself to be) but it was no better.0It was perhaps safer to avoid the pasta and pizza at all cost. We went for fried chicken and it was decently done.0An array of desserts, though not much was memorable and was hardly ""Italian"".My (only) favourite was the lime tart at the far end. 0For an Italian restaurant, I would expect better quality caffe.0I would recommend this place for the ambience and the quality of the ingredients, though not for a quench of ""un gusto Italiano"".', ""We came for the lunch buffet. The lighting is great for any occasion although it makes reading the menu slightly difficult, you'll find that it's bright enough for everything else.I was wowed by the decor and ambience; it's a very nice area and it's well complimented by the 5-star service.I found watching the waiters go around the restaurant with an iron to iron the table cloths very amusing, and it's one of the quirks that Lupa has to offer.The buffet food was alright, I personally didn't find anything special about it all and found the fungi pizza we ordered with the buffet slightly fatty, although the crust was divine. They were also generous with the toppings which was probably why I found it a bit 'fatty' (there was a lot of cheese). I'm not the biggest pizza fan, but I ate two slices and enjoyed them.They leave the bottles of water with you on a coaster which is thoughtful.In summary; I'm sure that the cooked dishes are wonderful (as I have heard that they are). However, the buffet is nothing special with the usual spread (although for a vegetarian and light eater I found it perfect) and above-average quality that you would expect from a restaurant of this quality. The service is wonderful and for the most part, the other diners are considerate. I definitely recommend Lupa, even more so if you miss the traditional great service that tends to disappear below the $500 dish priceline."", ""Atmosphere:First impression is really nice with elegant decoration and an awesome Terrace - Closed during lunch time unfortunately. Open kitchen on your right hand side when you arrive in the restaurant - A bit hidden though.Tables are a too packed though and gets noisy really quickly.Service:Warm welcoming staff on arrival - Service is the usual HK stuff unfortunately : An army of weak service staff.Somelier:From New York, took time to explain a bit about the wine nose, flavors, specificities which is great since we ordered a cheap Rose wine. Wine was ok and reasonably priced (according to hk standards): 300 hkd.Food:> Appertizer - Combination of seafoods starters: Out of 3, 1 was outstanding (Preserved Tuna and Cannellini) 1 is ok (Baccala with Olives and Citrus), 1 was really average (Octopus and Celery)> Pasta - Carbonara: Ok, the Pork Jowl is tasty but I would expect a more creamy sauce.> Pasta - Ricotta Gnocchi with Fennel and Sweet Sausage: Good, but only 10 pieces.> Pasta - Bucatini alAmatriciana: Good, but again the portion is extremely minimalist.Plates temperature:Starters: Were fresh and cold enough - good pointMains: Were definitely not warm enough, I almost rejected the carbo pastasDamage:700 hkd per headConclusion:Overall experience is Ok Minus, Overpriced comparred to what you can get elsewhere. I'd definitely rather go to ISOLA instead for a better service and location for the same price range. Lupa's terrace is nice though, I will be back for drinks only I think."", ""Anyone who has lived in the States, especially with in NYC, would not be unfamiliar with Mario Batali.  He is not just a famous chef and restaurateur but also has numberous cookbooks and TV shows as well as products and a gigantic Italian gourmet market (Eataly).  The Batalis empire is so huge that I am always amazed by his energy and ability to manage them all.Although I havent been to his restaurants overseas, I frequented his restaurants, particularly those in Manhattan when I lived there.  Different Batalis restaurants present different styles and types of Italian food   Del Posto being a rare Italian haute cuisine establishment, Esca being seafood-centric, Otto and Lupa being causal Italian treats, simple, hearty, and easy to approach and share .  My mom's favorite is Del Posto, and I love his first restaurant Babbo the most.  I used to visit Lupa or Otta regularly with my colleagues and friends, as the food was consistent, fresh and seasonally driven, and very reasonably priced.Normally I dont rush to try new restaurants, as I want to wait till the restaurants work out all the kinks and smoothly operate before I dine there.  However, I have been craving for simple good Italian for too long, and  I was eager to try Lupa out.  So on the first day of its lunch service, I visited with 2 friends, and revisited in 2 days.  These were my experiences in the 2 LUNCH visits.For the first day of Lupas lunch service, an impromptu causal lunch of 3 of us turned into full lunch menu tasting!  We couldnt resist but to order up almost everyone on the lunch menu.  Currently you must order the buffet of antipasti and desserts, and add soup, primi/pizza , and/or secondi of your choice. These items are mostly available at dinner as well, but priced much higher as a la carte dishes.  There were around 12-13 types of vegetables and pesca antipasti and salad, 4 types of salumi,  rosemary and sea salt focaccia, grissini, 5 types of desserts and fruits.  (Numbers might vary)  It is actually quite a bargain considered the selections and the generious portion sizes.I am not a big eater particularly at lunch, so I tried only a few that sounded interesting.Antipasti buffet:My picks of antipasti: lingua, fregula, & caponata0My picks of antipasti: lingua, fregula, & caponataRound 1: various salumi and seafood. I like the lingua (thin sliced ox tongue) with fennel and citrus peels and razor clams with fregula and basil the most. I dont see much fregula featured in Italian restaurants in Hong Kong so even there werent much razor clams I wanted more of this. For round 2, I had mainly vegetables and I enjoyed the caponata, grilled peppers with anchovies, and cipolla onions and balsamic. I also encored more lingua and razor clams and thats it for my buffet.Moving to primi and pizza. Despite just the 3 of us we ordered all 3 pasta available and a pizza . Pizza Margherita, the simplest and most classic pizza was our choice, just to test the water.  Pizza Margherita: Still need improvement0Pizza Margherita: Still need improvementThe Margherita pizza had nice char and bubbles at the cornicione and a chewy and fairly crusty base. However, the center was a bit too soggy for my liking. The wetness was probably due to the fresh tomato sauce which was a bit too watery and bland. The sauce and cheese required more seasoning.  We talked to Chef Allen, the chief chef at Lupa, and he mentioned that they were still getting used to the new oven and adjusting their execution and recipes every day.  I think it had potential and its the main reason I paid a second visit so quickly after this lunch.The 3 pastas available at lunch were also simple classic Italian pasta dishes, some of which being signatures in Lupa New York.  Bavette Cacio e Pepe is a thin spaghetti-like pasta made with black pepper and Cacio di Roma cheese.  This one was well executed with a robust peppery taste and al dente pasta.  Very simple but nice!  Bavette Cacio e Pepe 0Bavette Cacio e Pepe .Spaghetti alla Carbonara also had a good eggy flavor, with enough seared guanciale that were crispy and fatty.  They followed the authentic recipe without the use of cream.  The only caveat was that the egg yolk curdled a little when it cooled down. Overall a very good carbonara!Spaghetti alla Carbonara0Spaghetti alla Carbonara.Ricotta Gnocchi with Sausage and Fennel was definitely fluffier and less dense than what I had tried in other Italian restaurants in Hong Kong.  However I couldn't taste much fennel or sasuage that went with the cheesy tomato sauce .  Good gnocchi but I preferred a sauce with more complexity. (and if they can also give the gnocchi a crispy exterior by pan-searing it, like they do at Babbo and Del Posto)Ricotta Gnocchi with Sausage and Fennel 0Ricotta Gnocchi with Sausage and Fennel .We were greedy  and ordered 2 mains.  Braised Pork Shoulder with Averna and CucumberBraised Pork Shoulder w Averna & Cucumber0Braised Pork Shoulder w Averna & Cucumber. The main course pork shoulder used Italian Averna (an Italian liquer) and ginger which gave it an Asian flavor resembling Chinese black vinegar. Unfortunately the pork shoulder meat was too lean and the exterior meat was stringy, possibly caused by deep-frying.  Chef said he is trying to source pork knees which are fattier and more juicey locally to substitute as it was his original attempted recipe with pork kneesThe Averna used for the braised pork shoulder. Thanks Chef Allen for a taste of it! (I didn't get drunk even though it was of 32% alcohol )Averna for the sauce - very nice~0Averna for the sauce - very nice~.Lamb Braciole with olives and cannellini beans Lamb Braciole with olives and cannellini beans0Lamb Braciole with olives and cannellini beansThe lamb braciole was quite fatty this time with gelatinous and tender meat, rolled with cheese and crispy breadcrumbs. The olive flavor was very prominent, so good for those who like olives.   The crispy and crunchy textural contrast of the breadcrumbs outside and the pine nuts inside was simply fantastic.  The cannellini beans were also tender.   Although the lamb was definitely over salted during this visit,  this issue was fixed in the second visit.We were too full to enjoy the dessert buffet so I just had one bite of a few, including cinnamon amaretti cookies, chocolate bread pudding, Bombolini with cream filling.Dessert buffet - too full to try...0Dessert buffet - too full to try....On our 2nd visit, there was no lingua at the buffet so simply cheese including gorgonzola dolce, 2 types of pecorino, ricotta salata. More razor clams with fregula and basil and caponata for me.No Lingua this time, but more cheese0No Lingua this time, but more cheese.I ordered a fresh lemon soda as I couldnt drink at lunch and it was very refreshing.  The olive oil they use here is Lorenza No.1, (I was hoping they use DaVero which they use in Babbo in NYC). Fresh Lemon Soda, Lorenza No.1 Olive Oil0Fresh Lemon Soda, Lorenza No.1 Olive Oil.My biggest prize was the pizza. MY (note: mine, don't know about others') Funghi Taleggio pizza was very delicious! Pizza Funghi Taleggio1Pizza Funghi TaleggioPie crust was chewy without being too hard and the cornicione had crusty bubbles. For the upskirt I like it to be crustier and with more char, but this was pretty good.  The cornicione with puffed bubbles was still chewy but crustier than last time. When it cooled down it was much chewier...A plethora of aromatic shrooms, crunchy and juicy!  They went wonderfully with taleggio, one of my favorite melting cheese.  Much better than the Margherita last time! It could still do with a little more crusty texture.  Its not exactly Napoletana-styled pizza I say, more like Batalis own style, but quite close.  Please keep improving!My friend ordered the Lamb Braciole with Olives and Cannellini Beans which I had last time.  Not overly salted this time, but the lamb was leaner than before. I like the previous fattier lamb more.Not big on the desserts so just amaretti cookies and peanut butter cookies. More taleggio (because I real like it ) and rosemary focaccia and moscato to end the meal.Overall I was happy with my two lunch visits, especially given the reasonable price.  It is not up to the standard of Lupa New York yet, and not everything is perfect.  More consistency in execution of the main dishes and pizza would improve the overall performance immensely.  Chef Allen also told us that the team is trying to get better and more diverse sourcing of ingredients for a more enchanting menu. I am going to dinner in a few days to try out more dishes exclusive to the dinner menu. I believe giving it some time, Lupa will be an excellent causal Italian restaurant and a great addition to Hong Kongs Italian culinary scene.Supplementary InformationCurrently if you sit in the main dining room of Lupa,  the buffet of antipasti and desserts must be ordered at lunch - $168, you can: - add soup for an extra $30- add primi/pizza  for an extra $50- and/or secondi for an extra $90 Dinner is mainly a la carte dishes. There is no pizza available in the main dining room at dinner service.La Terrazza is the outdoor area of Lupa where you can order simple antipasti, pizza and drinks.

411,MARKET SEA,Central,Thai,3.0,240.0,15.0,"Came here for lunch on a weekday. We had a party of 4 and no reservation, so we actually had to wait for quite a while, around 30 minutes.The view here is quite good, and Id probably characterize that as the main draw of this place. You could come at night, though idk if youd be able to see as much. I got the massaman curry, which I thought might be spicy... but actually wasnt spicy at all. Anyways, the food was fine, but at 208 hkd, the portion was really small. What youre really paying for is the setting and the view, tbh. Anyway, some of my friends dishes were more substantial, and cheaper (such as the pho or the fried rice), so consider those when dining here.FYI there is a service charge.Lunch0Lunch', ""Agree with other posters about the great sea view and the pleasant decor. Came for lunch but was rather disappointed, especially remembering LIAN which was run by the same group MAXIMS (MX) also at IFC.They only offered the set lunch menu and did not provide the a la carte menu until asked. Obviously only wanted people to order from the set menu so we did.First that came was the lime soda, nothing much to write about. It was fine.Then came the starters, not together for all diners at the table (only 2) but whatever/whichever was ready/handy for them/ I had the papaya and pork salad which was in fact fine except that within 2 minutes came my main course! The server, on seeing that I was about 10% into the starter, plonked the main course on the table and left. My companion's main course came 10 minutes later.My main course was beef pho. The pho was actually very good but the beef was only so-so. They also included some tripe which I did not like.It is fine to charge premium prices since HK is expensive and IFC especially so.

So I\'m just going to keep it quick and simple from now on.Masu:Masu is located near LKF/Entertainment building. It has a pretty nice calming dark coloured decor (similar to Ana Gura), with a robotayaki area facing the open kitchen and widely spaced-out tables in the middle (perhaps a bit bigger than Ana Gura).We went there early so we could still order their value lunch sets (it think you have to place your order before 12:30p.m.).The menu, which was in Japanese and English, had most standard lunch sets such as sushi sets, sashimi sets, sashimi dons, various types of tempura and grilled cod set.We ordered a ""Three Don Set"" and a ""Grilled Cod Set"".Dons:Both sets came with salad. Just normal salad with a bit of ponzu. No complaints.: ,  - ,, ,...0: ,  - ,, ,...The steamed egg (chawan mushi) was decent. It had ginko in it.

Authentic and good - not to be taken for granted. - , 0 - , You could choose 3 dons out of a number of dons. I choose tempura, negi toro (minced tuna) and a sashimi don in order to test their mettle.Negi toro don:This was good. Very nice Japanese rice. The minced toro was pretty fresh. They could have added a lot more negi in my opinion.

It was at best average; some of the dishes were ok, some were subpar and one was downright awful. The grilled pork neck, lettuce wrapped minced pork and beef brisket curry were good enough. The spring rolls were very greasy and bland. The soft shell crab rolls were just fried crab wrapped in long slices of cucumber - bland, lazy and poor value. The dish that everybody hated was the grilled eggplant, a ridiculous concoction of eggplant, cheese, guacamole and bonito flakes, that looked and tasted terrible! On the positive side, the staff were friendly, and we were able to book a table for lunch at the weekend as we had a big group.', 'Walked past landle street during lunch time on saturday, saw the nice decoration from outside so went in to try. The green curry chicken and curry duck is good portion,  and the flavor is quite unique, very enjoyable. however the tung yum kung is bit too ""starchy"" and thick. I didn\'t finish it.

414,MINH & KOK,Causeway Bay,Thai,3.4,106.7,2.0,"One of the best South East Asian restaurant that serves up honest food. It doesn't do what other HK restaurants do which is to localize the dishes by dampening the flavour and reducing the flair of the dishes. The Minh and Koh in Fashion walk is a beautiful restaurant that has lovely decor, comfortable seating arrangements and has really good cutlery. Most importantly is that all the dishes that they serve are astonishing good.This was my second time here and we managed to order a lot more this time. The dish I would recommend the most is the beef pho which has one of the best beef broth I've tasted with a nice base and garnished correctly with onions, shallots and Thai basil. Perhaps its not the most authentic interpretation of the dish, but the dish was very clear and had a very nice beef flavor which you will not find in many places in Hong Kong. I loved the soft shell crab which had a nice crispy texture with a rich flavour wrapped in a small salad which complimented it nicely. The grilled pork neck was excellent. It was well cook and juicy to eat. The lime soda and the basil drink was also very nice. One of the best things about this restaurant was the generous proportion size each dish served. It was plentiful and we couldn't order more because we were so full after ordering a few dishes to share amongst the two of us. The sticky red rice pudding with mango was also superb. It was presented like a tower with a nice warm coconut milk base and a beautiful golden praline on top of it making it a thing of beauty.Honestly, this was one of my favorite places to eat because of the good value for money , but more importantly is that it does South East Asian food properly with flair and generosity. The restaurant has a very nice atmosphere and the food comes out very quickly. It is also very clean and I cannot recommend enough how good the dishes were. If you happen to be around Causeway Bay and are craving for something exciting, Minh and Koh is definitely worth considering to giving it a try."", 'Summary: OK food, as a Thai, I don\'t think it is very authentic. Very bad service from staffs thoughGoods: Price. Lunch set comes at HK$92 + 10% SC. This is for 1 main dish and a platter of appetizers (good amount)Bads: As said bad attitude, more details belowWe went for lunch at this restaurant. It was our second time and we did think about it before going but wanted to give them another chance. When we arrived, a staff asked us how many people and disappeared into the restaurant so we followed. There were 2 tables with 4 chairs each (we were a group of 6). They were trying to have us sit at a corner table which can only sits 4 but there is a table nearby whose guests are ""about"" to leave. So they asked 2 of us to wait outside (didn\'t even say why it has to be outside). We waited for 5 minutes (outside), and eventually they had to ask the 2 persons at the next table to leave (poor them!). Note that for all these time. and the 2 tables that I mentioned were still available. OK that\'s fineSo we ordered with one in our group specifically said no peanuts (he is allergic to it). Our orders arrived pretty slow (15 mins of wait probably). and his........ comes with peanuts!!! OK, mistake happens, so we asked them to change. The server took the dish away, came back and said (real quote) ""the chef said there is no peanuts only garlic"". Look at the photo and ask yourself, are there just garlic or also peanuts. I\'m no chef but 100% sure that there were peanuts (I also ordered the same dish). They took it back and 15 mins later came back without peanuts this time.I think it is problem with attitude of some staffs and clearly the ones designated to be the front facing was not good at all (not smiling, awkward table management), and honestly my colleague can get killed for eating those peanuts for their lack of attention and I think basically don\'t really care.Caramelized Pork with noodle$ 680Caramelized Pork with noodle$ 68', ""A new restaurant opened in Causeway Bay from MAX Concepts, the fancier end of the huge Maxim Group. This time it's called Minh & Kok, serving Vietnamese (Minh) and Thai (Kok). It's a beautifully decorated restaurant, with colorful blue walls and open spaces. Everything is relaxing and tasteful as any well done MAX Concepts restaurant.I arrived at lunch and it wasn't very busy. I was given a lunch menu which you can choose a main plus drink for $68 or add the appetizer platter for $92. I decided on the platter, tomato soup noodles with crabmeat and fried egg and ice calamasi lemon honey drink.lunch menu1lunch menuService was bad. I ordered by reading the menu in English. Server perhaps had poor English as she had to return twice to ask what I ordered. And whenever she returned to ask what I ordered, it was always wrong. It got to the point of being annoying, that I think when she came back to ask what drink I ordered, I replied in an annoyed tone of voice. Food also arrived in backwards order. In that my noodles arrived first, then my appetizer and lastly my drink. However, food arrived fast. Like 5 minutes after I ordered, my food all arrived. I didn't even have time for a round of Candy Crush!Ice calamasi lemon honey drink was fantastic. I loved everything calamasi and this was strong with the citrus fruit. It was sweetened slightly with the honey. It was also icy cold.iced calamasi lemon honey0iced calamasi lemon honeyMinh & Kok platter was meal itself. It included a Viet springroll, steamed mince pork parcel, chicken skewer, crab claw, papaya salad, mango beetroot summer roll. It looked beautiful. Sadly, it was all cold. Most likely prepared ahead of time. Springroll was chewy. The steamed mince pork package was also chewy and the rice wrapper thick. The chicken skewer was good but sadly cold. Onlyfish sauce was given. The skewer could have used a little satay sauce. The crab claw was basically pork meat wrapped around a nonexistent crab meat claw. The papaya salad was ok though not acidic enough. The beetroot and mango summer roll was an odd combination as the beetroot was crunchy and the mango was mushy.Minh and Kok platter0Minh and Kok platterTomato soup noodles with crabmeat and fried egg was ok. The noodles were chewy but the soup wasn't tomato enough and overly spicy. There was minced meat added and the egg was one well done blob, much like you would find in a cha chan teng. After much searching, there was a few shreds of crabmeat.tomato soup noodles with crab and fried egg0tomato soup noodles with crab and fried eggThe place is disappointing as it's a beautiful looking place.

Of course no1 can top Tsui Wah's butter buns with condensed milk...In regards to service, needs improvement....drinks came after we were done eating, after rushing them.

I have no idea why as I'm not a big garlic fan. But it was gimmicky and hey ... I'm all about the gimmicks. Mad for Garlic originates from Korea and is a steakhouse with a serious focus on garlic. And lots of it.Mad for Garlic is now offering weekday lunch sets. Sets include a salad, drink and main and range from $120 - $230. Menu is in English and Chinese.0They do start you off with a little plate of pickles. These were the sweet kind and liked it.0I chose the lemon-ade which was basically lemon syrup with a mix of yuzu in soda water. It tasted like yuzu mixed Sprite.0My set salad was a decent size. I didn't expect it to be so big. The greens were fresh and included slices of mushrooms and olives. The salad dressing was yuzu based. Everything was evenly coated. A fairly decent salad.0Garlic Carbonara ($128). For the lunch set, I chose this. I had expected a smaller portion size but was surprised it was pretty generous. It was extremely creamy though the pasta was bit overcooked but not too much to be soggy and unedible. Was there a lot of garlic added? I really couldn't tell but I had expected to see mounds of crispy garlic chips like the photos I saw online. I guess they don't add this for lunch sets. Over all it was an ok tasting plate of pasta though a bit too creamy.0Service was good. Food was decent enough but for the advertisement of garlic, I did expect more. May return again. Unsure."", 'As a garlic lover, this place has always been on my list to try. After watching a vlog on YT, I decided that it was time to go. The two of us went around noon but the restaurant wasn\'t busy at all. So we requested for the private booth and the receptionist said they were ALL reserved. OK fine. Long story short, we stayed until 2:30 which was way past lunch time and did the reserved booths get used? Maybe 30%. So naturally I was not happy with their receptionist. She should know better. Anyway, onto the food. We ordered the lunch sets which were a pretty good deal compared to the regular menu. Lunch sets included a salad, a main, and a drink. There was also a small dish of pickled cucumbers to share. Out of the many options, we chose Arrabbiata and Dancing Salsa Rice with Beef. The first dish was a little tart and sweet which was quite appetizing. A good kick with the chili spice but not enough fried garlic. The pasta was cooked al dente. Pretty yummy!The second dish had a nice fun name and it was presented on a hot grilled plate. The food quickly turned cold though. We mixed well the rice, beef, egg, and salsa before eating... kinda like a bimbimbap and it tasted ok... definitely did not exceed my expectation. The beef was Australian yet quite tough to chew.  The dish could have been better if the meat was tender. For a place called ""Mad for Garlic"", the two lunch dishes we picked were definitely not garlicky enough.

I didnt take a lot of photos because I dont think I need to keep memory of it.00Id finally turn on the camera app to capture these two desserts.

Madame Ching is no different. Located on Star Street in Wan Chai, Madame Ching is a complementary Chinese spot that is a modern Chinese roast house. This big feast for one started with 3 amazing starters:General Sons ChickenGeneral Sons Chicken0General Sons Chicken1. Catchy name for the a fancy dish of crispy chicken with sansho pepper.2.It got my heart immediately when its served as it looks and smells so good!3. I had the first one without dipping any sauce at the bottom. It tastes so good with the crunchy skin and hot tender meat inside.4. The sweet and sour sauce with sansho pepper at the bottom is absolutely fantastic! I love the numbing spiciness of the sauce which brings so much flavour to the chicken.5. It is really chopsticks licking good! Make sure you go for the sauce hidden in the bottom!Sesame Prawn ToastSesame Prawn Toast0Sesame Prawn Toast1. The General Sons Chicken was so good, and I wonder how good would this toast thingy be when it was served with a comparatively more ordinary look, with an outstanding sunny side up on top.2. Poking the egg yolk and soak it with the toast is always so fun! Am I the only one?3. First bite and I already know I wasnt being fair to this dish. The toast is made with milk bread, which is so rich in flavour!4. And the prawns tare inside the toast is just so fresh and delicious!5. Of course, the toast is topped up by the egg yolk! Nom Nom!Coriander and Green Radish SaladCoriander and Green Radish Salad1Coriander and Green Radish Salad1. Here comes the dish that I dont really like. Not their fault, its me who never like any salad nor veggies.2. But I have to say, even though I am not a green or salad person, the dressing is definitely delighting.3. The ma la (numbing spicy) bits surely work their magic to give your taste bud some hot and numbing sensation, and it does taste quite spicy!4. As for the peeled green radish that looks like thick noodles, I guess they are quite good for those who love veggies.5. I filled my stomach with the first two starters, so I didnt finish this dishSorry!Main - Roasted ChickenMain - Roasted Chicken0Main - Roasted Chicken1. To be honest, I was actually relived to see the main this small, as I was already quite full at this moment after 3 big starters.2. Being a roast house, Madame Ching does know how to roast! The chicken has very delicious crispy skin, and smooth tender meat underneath. It is also a sign that the chicken is just cooked right, not too raw with blood nor overcooked.3. The nam prik sauce does add a bit of extra flavor to the dish.4. I totally ignored the prickle cubes on the side after trying one. Not my cup of tea. But you might like it if you like Chinese pickle.5. I would love to visit again to try out their other roast.Side - Roast CauliflowerSide - Roast Cauliflower0Side - Roast Cauliflower1. A full bowl of cauliflower. Really generous portion!2. Even for veggies hater like me, I still like this side!3. The deep fried garlic topped up the texture and flavour of the dry cauliflower.4. The cauliflower is not overly dry after roasting. Its still quite succulent.5. This dish balances out all the guilt from eating all those delicious meat.Dessert - Ma Lai GohDessert - Ma Lai Goh0Dessert - Ma Lai Goh1. The big feast ends with this amazing Ma Lai Goh, which is a traditional Chinese cake dessert.2. Madame Chings version of Ma Lai Goh is surely a nice modernized reinvention with a chocolate flavour.3.

420,Majesty Chinese Restaurant,Central,Chinese,3.1,150.0,,"0It's easy to get carried away eating dumplings in Hong Kong, most Chinese restaurants seem to do dim sum during the busy lunch period. My dumplings place of choice is Din Tai Fung, but there is not a Din Tai Fung close to work, so I've had to look for other places to dine. You'd think that would be easy with so many restaurants, right? Well, I'm finding it pretty difficult, mainly because most of the restaurants are not on street level, but on various floors in high rise buildings, so it's a bit hit and miss.I've managed to find one restaurant nearby that is clearly marked from street level and is relatively easy to access... I mean, you just have to go up a couple of floors in a rickety old elevator and guess at the right level because I can't quite read Chinese yet!The Majesty Seafood Restaurant takes up the whole of level two (or three) and has pretty awesome views of Queens Road Central for a brief respite during lunch from the crazy crowds that make up Central HK. On my first visit, I was placed right by the window and had a great view of the crush of crowds below.0 There were no menus for lunch at the Majesty, it's a matter of pulling out a slip of paper that has all of the menu items, thankfully in English as well. However, with no real sections that I could discern (again, suffering from not reading Chinese), I had to have a guess at what I was ordering and hoping that I'd receive the dumplings I was very much craving for. The sweet smell of success..... I'd guessed right and the very dumplings I'd been hoping for started to arrive at my table. In what had turned out to be a case of eyes bigger than belly, I'd ordered too many dumplings, twelve in all. My favourite was easily the big prawn dumplings encased a glutinous dough that allowed the large prawn pieces to shine through. In fact, they looked so inviting, I ignored the warning bells in my head and jumped straight in, while they were still steaming hot. Yeah, that was a big mistake. Not wanting to spit the dumpling out, I held it in my mouth, trying to cool it down, but in the process just burned the inside of my mouth! Another lesson learned in HK - wait until food stops steaming.0 0Mouth burning aside, I really enjoyed all of the dumplings from the Majesty Seafood Restaurant and have been back a few time for lunch. Definitely a great spot for a quick bite to eat if you're in Central.0Options are in English too, but the groupings and titles are not0The ubiquitous tea that comes with every meal0I also really like the pork dumplings with prawn0Prawn dumplings and some sad looking xiaolongbao""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-majesty-chinese-restaurant/14514?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

Mak An Kee is your old school breakfast spot and Tsim Tsai Kee is a new school (more hip) breakfast spot.

We'd been invited by a Thai friend, not because she recommended it but because she'd heard good things and wanted to give it a try. We weren't disappointed. We had the weekend brunch which with free flow drinks and dishes galore was outstanding value for money. My personal favourite was the prawn and crab cakes. The Saaur rong hai beef was a bit hot for me but I'm not a great lover of hot food and know many people who would love this. Finally the deserts are superb and you need to leave room for them, particularly the mango and blue sticky rice and coconut ice cream.Overall it was a great brunch experience, with great food and drink, but most of all the service is refreshingly .... not like customer service and more like hosting a group of friends.

There's no excuse. Food was no better than ok. Every dish except for the pomelo salad was drenched in oil, so greasy. The omelette was especially oily, Prices are on the high end, Hard for me to come up with any reason to go back.

Though quite high priced, the dishes looked all well made and the menu was difficult to chose from as there were many scrumptious options. I haven't had Thai food in a long time and my mother said her Pad Thai was very authentic and worth the 122 dollars she paid for it. I decided to order an appetizer which was amazingly portioned and very filling!

The place is bright, clean and well-managed, and since it was early (about 11:30am) not too busy yet. 0I ordered the Wonton Noodle to start, while Ivy went for the Beef Tendon and Wonton Noodle. Yes, the portion is small, but that is the right size per the original serving. The noodle has the perfect texture, got a nice bite, and the clear soup was very good, full of flavors and delicious. Of course the wonton is their signature, with the shrimp very crunchy, with each wonton of bite size and having the right balance of shrimp and pork. Definitely one of the best wonton noodles in town in my opinion.As the portion is not big enough for me, as my routine I ordered another Dumpling Noodle. The same noodle and soup base, but instead of the smaller wonton the dumplings are larger, with the wood mushroom further adding the crunchy texture for enjoyment. It is equally tasty.With the three noodle and nothing else, the bill was $142. For many they would say it was a bit expensive, but nowadays considering you have to pay $100 for a Japanese ramen, I would not undermine the value and all the effort in making this wonton noodle, so for me it is of reasonable value for money.My overall rating is 63/100.', ""We decided to come here after still feeling a bit hungry from Boomshack (also in the same area).

Seating is more cramped.Menu is in the form of a check off menu. If you want photos, they have a picture menu on each table. For the $58 promotion, it seems they remove all the toppings?

Good enough for me, so I skipped the extra toppings part.0I chose miso broth, thin noodles in a medium consistency and normal strength taste. Overall, the soup was good. A good mix of miso and pork broth. It was strong and thick. The char siu was ok though a bit too much fat content. The noodles were chewy with no after taste. But where was my quail eggs? I dug about and found none. Didn't the staff inform me it included quail eggs? I peaked at the person across from me and saw no quail eggs in hers as well. None in her friend's who sat next to her.

After looking through their lunch menu, I opted for the Noodles Beef Short Ribs cooked 48 hours with Chinese Radish Sauce.Lunch Menu0Lunch MenuThe soup of the day came first and today's was winter melon soup. It was very flavorful and not watery at all, which can be the case at other restaurants.Soup0SoupThen my lo mein came a mushroom and some sliced veggies garnished on top. The waitress came by and squeezed some cream from a can, and informed me that it was sesame oil. Guess that's where the molecular aspect of the meal is coming from. The noodle was a special blend of northern dan dan noodle and southern wonton noodle. There was hardly any sauce on the noodles so at first I was afraid it will be quite dry to eat. The noodle was interesting as the texture of the noodle was thick and chewy with egg flavor. It was not as dry as I thought, and with some soup I was able to finish the noodles quickly.Lo mein0Lo meinWhen my 48 hours slowed cooked beef short ribs came, it was nicely plated with the radish sauce on the bottom and some peanuts on top. It was also a bit seared on the surface of the beef. Contrary to the name, there were no bones at all with the meat. At my first bite, I though the beef was quite tender but there was also a big problem. It was not hot but COLD. I mean it was not cold cold but when I imagine slowed cooked beef short ribs, I'd imagined the ribs sitting in some pot and arriving steaming hot in front of me. I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be like this since this is some new molecular cuisine but I finally asked the waitress if my beef was supposed to be cold. She said no and took it back to reheat for me. One of the chefs brought it back it me and the beef now looked overcooked with the outside being darker and more seared, but the inside was still a bit cold. My stomach was sinking fast and I was ready to write this place off. The chef apologized and explained it was because the beef was frozen and ice had formed ALL OVER. What?! He then offered to make a brand new piece for me.48 hour slow cooked beef148 hour slow cooked beefMy expectations were low at that point, but the second plate of beef looked much better. It was nicely seared ont the surface but looked reddish pink on the inside like steak. Finally, the beef was at the right temperature. It was very tender and flavorful, and the chinese radish sauce went very well with the beef. The sauce was basically crushed radish so there were bits of radish for texture. It was interesting how the sauce and beef are cooked in a more Western style but together they taste like the traditional chinese beef short ribs dish.48 hour slow cooked beef048 hour slow cooked beefI'm glad they were able to redeem themselves with the second plate of beef.

Nothing bad, but not great.The starter was a pumpkin soup: it was thick and creamy. Quite heavy, but if you like thick soup then this fits.The caesar salad was mostly lettuce, with a few croutons and bacon bits. Its main problem was the dressing; it was too heavy, and had an artificial taste.Main course was the sirloin steak.

If only the chicken patty wasn't all that mushy (barely able to detect meat) and the fried egg not so salty and greasy, this would be a rather fun treat.

That said, their dessert options weren\'t nearly as attractive as their entrees and mains so there wasn\'t too much to lose.

These were very mundane, and I took greater interest in its nice wooden serving container over the bread.complementary bread0complementary breadFor entrees, we had the calamari rings and salad to share. These were very well portioned. And when you compare it to the mains, I would probably call these the first main and the main being the second main. They\'re not big big, but a good portion. The calamari rings were well fried. Batter was relatively thin, smooth and lightly seasoned. The spicy black olive tomato sauce was a little too complex for this common dish though, which distracted from the flavours of the nicely done calamari. I ended up avoiding most of the sauce and went with just a small drible of lemon juice (which was a waste of the nicely done sauce which just didn\'t match the calamari that well).lightly fried calamari, spicy tomato sauce with black olives and capers...0lightly fried calamari, spicy tomato sauce with black olives and capers...The salad was (again) well proportioned (read: very big for an entree) and underlying flavour fresh . It was very salty though , and I would definitely ask for less salt next time (and encourage anyone else who orders this to request less salt as well, since they place a small cup of rough salt on your table anyway). I liked it if it was not for the saltiness. These entree portion sizes work great for sharing amongst a small group of up to four people.Italian chicories salad with cucumber and tomato, aged balsamic and olive oil...0Italian chicories salad with cucumber and tomato, aged balsamic and olive oil...The tomato basil pizza was juicy (and oily), and the crust and how it was put together made it a very satisfying pizza indeed.

It\'s been a while since I\'ve had such a satisfying spicy tomato base.

Definitely my favourite in the meal. rigatoni and meatballs, smoked chilli tomato ragu0rigatoni and meatballs, smoked chilli tomato raguAs we were sharing, we each had an additional plate to our own. The staff helped change our plates and cutlery between entree and main automatically. This is excellent. It\'s important to avoid mixing flavours. For me, the calamari was dry and I had the salad on the plate it came with so it was a little unnecessary for myself, but it\'s certainly a great gesture and does keep things tidy if you had the salad on that plate of your own. They were also attentive enough to provide sharing cutlery without us asking.A small gripe is that the staff kept bumping into my chair ever so slightly. Of 10 passes, at least 8 if not 9 times they had caused me to feel my chair to wobble. This included who appeared to be the store manager in a suit, who was ever so kind to step aside and let another customer pass through at the \'T\' junction (if I may call it that) when he bumped into my chair as he entered the \'side road\'. None of the staff seem to notice though. Fine onece or twice, but doing so on every single pass is quite a record at any restaurant to be honest. During my hour there, they had passed at least 15-20 times. I was seated on the inside aisle between two of their oversized sharing tables.From the reviews, I came with an expectation of good ambiance and average food. The visit certainly exceeded my expectations.Supplementary Information""Two course"" lunch menu only allows entree and main (you can\'t choose main and dessert)', ""0I had to make some serious decisions during my visit to New York, admittedly not life or death decisions, but important to me.So many restaurants and so little time meant that I had to carefully choose where I would spend my hard earned money. One of the very last nights left in Manhattan came down to a choice between three star restaurants, Daniel and Jean-Georges.Daniel won out on the day, but I'd always felt as if I'd missed out on something special.A couple of years down the track I learned that Jean-Georges was opening an outlet of his slightly more casual Mercato in Hong Kong and I was excited. I was finally getting to check out the fare of one of the United States' top chefs. So cool.Located in California Tower, one of LKF's funkiest buildings, I'd managed to sneak into Mercato at the right time. Not yet formally open and running through a soft opening month, I happened to dine on a day where Jean-Georges himself was hosting with some of his crew responsible for designing the restaurant and lighting.0Stepping out of the lifts and entering Mercato, I quickly noticed the lighting in the striking interior of the ultra chic restaurant. As it turned out, the lighting was one of the features of the Neri & Hu designed interior, and Jean-Georges had brought over the designer as part of the soft opening. He explained to me that the idea behind the lighting was designed to mimic the mood of the day - a bluish purple during the day and a funky red as the evening wore on.The interior was dominated by a bar at one end that stretched all the way up to the very high ceilings and an open kitchen at the other. Red brick gave an earthy feeling, that when offset by the dozens of hanging lights, provided a natural yet contemporary feel. I liked it and felt instantly at home.0I was quickly joined by a gaggle of other bloggers and all of a sudden it was time to eat, a selection of starters from the extensive modern Italian menu materialising magically at our table.My first bite of cuisine by Jean-Georges was the spicy tuna tartar with black olives, cucumber and avocado. Served in a deep bowl, contrasting colours from the pink tuna and green avocado enlivened the dish. The fresh tuna was lovely, especially when combined with the creamy avocado; puffed rice added some texture and a lovely little crunch in my mouth.0I moved quickly onto the salmon carpaccio, which was finished with olive oil, lime and a dusting of sea salt; yellow and purple edible flowers tactically placed on the plate helped the dish transform from food into edible art. The fresh salmon was sliced thin, yet still held a texture that was pleasant to eat. It was enjoyable on the whole, but when I had a mouthful with the added sea salt, the flavours really exploded in my mouth, so a little more of that seasoning would have really helped.0There was a strong bite from the endive and sugar snap pea salad that was both refreshing and memorable. On its own, the endive would have been too overpowering, but the addition of a parmesan dressing really helped balance the dish. I liked the simplicity of the dish, each piece of endive had it's own filling, so you just picked up the enclosed leaf and munched away.0Still keeping it very simple, an Italian chicories salad with orange and fennel was presented. I loved the bright orange sitting atop the salad, which was then finished with an aged balsamic. The sweetness of the orange matched perfectly with the bite of the chicories salad. It was the first time that I really paid attention to the crockery used at Mercato, the matt black of the plate helping the colours from the salad really dominate. It was a clever use of plating to enhance a simple salad.0In what felt much more like a dessert than a starter, one of Mercato's signature dishes was up next. House made ricotta with strawberry and garlic bread sticks made an interesting departure from the fresh crudo and salads that we'd been devouring to that point. The soft round ricotta cheese was topped with a strawberry jam, with the idea that the toasted garlic breadsticks be used to dip into the cheese. I'd been sceptical about the dish looking at it, but it worked really well. The sweetness of the strawberry working in harmony and the texture of the breadsticks giving a satisfying crunch.0As I'd been exploring the dining room before our meal, I'd noticed the wood fired oven in the kitchen, and knew that wood fired oven meant pizza. And what a pizza! Imagine adding black truffle to three different cheeses and then topping with a farm fresh egg. The smell was amazing! The aroma of the truffle was overwhelming and really made me want to dig in; so that's what I did. The egg was slightly oozy and the creamy yolk paired beautifully with the umami flavour of the truffle. A crisp base held it's shape as I quickly devoured my slices of the pizza. It was extremely memorable, especially since I'm a traditionalist and usually stick to a Margherita!0It wouldn't be a visit to an Italian restaurant without trying the pasta, the rigatoni with meatballs and a smokey chilli ragu. Fat and moist meatballs dominated the dish, but the tasty meatballs were ably supported by the perfectly cooked rigatoni. Interestingly, I found the chilli to be quite mild in the dish and found myself wanting just a little more heat to make the dish really exciting.0We were given a couple more of the Mercato signature dishes for mains. I thought that the porcini crusted salmon presented with a warm leek and lemon vinaigrette looked beautiful on the plate. I'd initially thought that the crust was the salmon skin, but as I bit into the salmon, tasted the earthy texture of the porcini crust. It was a little disconcerting but once my mind adjusted to the texture change, the earthy porcini played nicely with the slightly sweet salmon.0It was good, but the dish of the day had to be the crispy skin chicken with braided potatoes and lemon, which was simply divine. It looked more like a spatchcock due to it's size and the flesh was incredibly sweet, but what I really loved was the crispy skin that texturally and flavour wise was just super. I could totally understand why the chicken was one of the dishes that Mercato and Jean-Georges rate as the best!0It was time for dessert, and we were assaulted with a plethora of dishes that came out in rapid succession. Starting with an interesting take on a tiramisu, the simple looking dessert actually looked like an ice-cream sandwich, but the texture was soft and the flavours pure tiramisu. Chocolate, coffee and cream balancing together perfectly!0One of the more beautiful desserts I've seen for a while was the Italian cream cake with raspberry sorbet and fresh raspberries. There was a simplicity of the plate's design that added to its prettiness, as well as the symmetry on the pate, a berry coulis looking suspiciously like the Mercato logo design. The cake was moist, the sorbet sharp and a shard of tuile added texture. I really loved the dessert, but it wasn't my favourite.0That honour went to the home made mascarpone with macerated strawberries and young ginger granita, which was essentially a big pot of love strawberries and cream. The granita added temperature to the mix, so the creaminess of the mascarpone was offset by a super cold hit to the palate - tasty and refreshing!0All of the desserts from Mercato were visually stunning, I also loved the dark chocolate passionfruit tart with passionfruit sorbet; there was also a dessert that consisted of three scoops of peanut butter ice-cream in a pool of warm chocolate and finished with caramel covered popcorn. Yeah, the desserts at Mercato were pretty special!000The whole time we were at lunch, Jean-Georges was actively talking to all of the diners and doing a fantastic job of hosting the day. I was stoked to get a few minutes chatting to JG, who was clearly happy with the finish and design of his newest restaurant. I could tell he was proud of the restaurant, but he seemed most happy about the lighting!Soft openings are interesting affairs, usually in place to help the restaurant iron out any 'kinks' and ensure the full opening is a first rate affair for diners. As far as I could tell, the restaurant was running like a well oiled machine on the day of my visit, and I couldn't really pick on any issues at all. It would be interesting to see how the team would perform on a busy Friday night with a full house!My first experience of a Jean-Georges restaurant was a memorable one, good food, great environment and a quick conversation with the man himself. What more could you want?Well, as it turns out, I now have reservations about my decision to choose Daniel instead of Jean-Georges.... Ahh, it just gives me an excuse to get back to New York!@FoodMeUpScotty0We started with some soft bread with rosemary - with a peppery olive oil for dipping0Mercato has a special cocktail menu0I went for the Vodka Thyme and Lemonade 0This whisky based cocktail was a little too strong for some at the table!0There are a couple of different areas for dining at Mercato0Jean-Georges giving last minute instructions to the kitchen?0Restaurant Manager Romain B - a very good host!0Jean-Georges"", 'This week, Hong Kong welcomes Chef Jean Georges back with open arms in Lan Kwai Fong at the new California Tower.

But as you can order the exact amount of meat that you want, you know how much you are eating.Another tip would be do grab a high chair if you are wearing high heels.

For example, if I like the steak which is med-ium-well, just order a steak in med-ium because the metal plates are extremely hot that will keep heating the meat while you are eating. Therefore, if you order a med-ium well steak, the second half of it would be ""well-done"" by the time you eat it. As said, not being a meat-love, I like the onions and corn on the side.

The Metropol is brilliantly located in the heart of Admiralty, making it a very convenient choice for office dwellers in search of lunchtime sustenance. Also, they\'re big, so chances are that you will get a table. This time, we had a little office gathering for a colleague\'s birthday and I think I speak for all of us when I say that the food was delicious, the service good and we all had a fabulous time. Must haves include the BBQ Pork and the Steamed Beef Balls, but with the exception of the Xiao Long Bao (which sadly arrived deflated and dry), the food was all very enjoyable. This is not the ""haute cuisine"" of a Tim Ho Wan or Shang Palace, but nitty gritty wholesome dim sum for the casual munchies.

Reminded me of the pepper buns at Taiwanese night markets!!  Yummy!!The citron yuzu shrimp was good but a bit too sweet for me. The noodles were very well done.  Soup was tasty, meats was tender. We added the double boiled Soup and the mouse dumplings last. Soup was excellent. Sweet and full of flavors. Served like the Japanese Tea pot soups. Great way to share.We were disappointed with the mouse dumplings. The exterior mochi was great but the chicken filling inside was bland and dry.I'm now a big fan. 9 dishes was a bit over $600 HKD.

454,Ming Garden Restaurant,Wan Chai,Chinese,4.0,43.0,2.0,"I've actually tried dinner at this small restaurant once with my colleagues. The sharks fin and abalone were good at very reasonable price.However, since the dinner was quite a while ago, I couldn't really remember what I had. This review will focus on the takeaway lunches I've recently tried on two occasions. On each occasion, the place was crowded for dining-in. However, you could jump the queue if you order take away. I tried the lotus leaf steamed rice on the first occasion and a steamed chicken plus roast pork rice the next day.After waiting for about 15 minutes outside the restaurant, the rice finally arrived. The lotus rice was pretty big but It wasn't aromatic at all. It's basically soy sauce fried rice with some chopped abalone and pork. I can't recommend this. I decided to give this restaurant another chance before writing a food review on OpenRice so I tried it the next day. After all, the restaurant is famous for it's chicken so I ordered a chicken and roast pork rice. (). This was much much better than the lotus rice I had the other day. Basically, the chicken was meaty and tender. I believe the chicken was marinated with some spice and salt then steamed. It's quite tasty . I can see why this is the signature dish of the restaurant. The roast pork was also pretty good. It's crispy and not too salty. The meat was tender too. Also worth mentioning was the rice. You'd be surprised at how many restaurants don't cook their rice properly at lunchtime. The rice at Ming Yuen was cooked properly with the right timing. The rice box was about 8  x 6  x 2 inches - quite small compared with a typical lunchbox in Hong Kong but the quality was good. The soup which accompanied the lunch set was nice too. It wasn't just MSG laden water but a properly boiled soup with winter melon, chicken, pepper and almond. The chicken meat was pretty tender.Although the size is not big, at HK$46 for a whole set and ONLY 3 minutes' wait (I've actually timed it), its another worthy option for lunch - just stick to the chicken during lunch time.  0"", ""I love coming here for lunch, especially for their steamed rice buckets! Not only do you get a LOT of juicy, succulent, fall off the bone spareribs, but you also get a plump, meaty chicken foot to boot! I don't usually let myself eat this much rice... but the rice is really soft, moist, tasty, hot, and just all around delicious. This is definitely my go-to place when I wanna be baaad! (So worth it!)  PS. Go early for lunch because they usually sell out of these steamed rice buckets FAST!Steamed rice - YUM!0Steamed rice - YUM!""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/wan-chai-ming-garden-restaurant/16955?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
455,Ming General Japanese Sushi Restaurant,Wan Chai,Japanese,2.8,51.0,0.0,"Went there to apply Vietnam visa, planning to go Ho Chi Mihn for short break in end Jul. Didn't check the opening time and arrived at 2pm, 30 minutes earlier than their afternoon service hours. It's terribly hot out there, I didn't want to walk somewhere else to have quick lunch, and found this sushi restaurant, immediately sat down.Didn't notice it's actually all-you-can eat sushi, was wondering why there were no menu and price list. I didn't care and started to pick my first dish, I was so hungry. None of the dishes look attractive, I was a bit regret, but anyway, just a quick bite.  After the peak hours, there were only less than 5 customers there, so it's comfortably quiet.$48 all-you-can-eat, tea costs $3Sushi quality is no good, but considering the price, serving such a big cube of rice can get credit. Finished 4 dishes, totally 8 pieces, made me feel so full, felt like finishing a big bowl of rice, haha.Didn't have the most common ones like salmon nor shrimp, because they looked ugly. Both salmon and shrimp looked so dry and tiny, especially put them on top of the big cube of rice.One thing I really appreciated, the warning of food waste. As long as it's buffet or all-you-can-eat type of offer, people always get more than they can eat, and waste food. Having this warning can avoid people from doing that.Not sure if restaurants around charging average price of this during lunch hour, better to raise the price say $60 or $80 all-you-can-eat and improve the quality. Honestly, it's worse than supermarket sushi packs.00000""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/wan-chai-ming-general-japanese-sushi-restaurant/11615?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

457,Mirror & Vegan Concept,Central,Italian,3.4,130.0,0.0,"Reserved a table for lunch just a few days ago on openrice. It was quite a small restaurant. Reservation should better be made in advance.Came here purely because one of my lunch partners was a vegetarian and there seemed to be quite a number of options in their lunch sets, even with a non-vegetarian option. Comments seemed to be pretty good on openrice too.Lunch Menu0Lunch MenuHowever, we were told that the Spaghetti Bolognese was sold out when we were about to order. There were a few options at different prices which were reasonably priced for lunch in Central. An appetizer and a soup of the day were included in the lunch set, as well as coffee/tea.The appetizer was a simple salad with a lot of vinegar. Personally I found it too heavy and oily although the veggies were fresh. The soup was sweetcorn cream soup which was ok.Mixed Mushroom Spaghetti with Bell Pepper$ 1300Mixed Mushroom Spaghetti with Bell Pepper$ 130I ordered Mixed Mushroom Spaghetti with Bell Pepper as my mains. The spaghetti itself was cooked quite well which was pretty al dente, reasonably al dente at such a price indeed. There were sufficient ingredients with the mushrooms and bell peppers. However, the reason for the below average rating was that it was too salty. It was not too oily despite being fried with oil (obviously) but being too salty was really killing.I just ordered hot lemon water as my drink. There was nothing special to talk about.At such a price, I believe there should be better options elsewhere in the same district. Will not leave it on my to-go list for a weekday lunch.', 'Summary: If it really is vegan, It might just be the best vegetarian restaurant in Hong Kong. Delicious dishes that are way too rich/creamy to be soy/coconut/nut-based, but if they are, are incredibly well-done. Bring your meat-loving friends for lunch and open their eyes to a better world (hope you all like carbs though).We must have said I cant believe this is vegan at least 10 times collectively during our lunch. Between the incredible risottos and creamy pastas, I still have a hard time believing there wasnt a drop of cream or dairy-based product in any of the food. They serve both lunch sets and dinner a la carte, but we stopped by for lunch on a miserably cold and rainy afternoon.Their lunch set (~120+) comes with a daily starter (simple salad) and a soup of the day (cauliflower), as well as a main course (all of which were pasta or risotto). The cauliflower soup was, as will be a reoccurring comment all-review, far richer than normal cauliflower and potato purees (the cauliflower soup at Mana for example is far lighter), but also lacked that tell-tale coconut-ness which Im extremely sensitive to (I hate it). Delicious and flavorful, it was also served with a piece of toasted bread that was covered in what tasted like butter (margarine I assume?).The main courses are where we were really blown away, I mean check these out:Spinach and Mushroom Risotto with ArtichokeSpinach and mushroom risotto0Spinach and mushroom risottoSeriously, not only was this completely indistinguishable from a standard butter-and-cheese affair, its probably the best risotto Ive had in a long time. From its inexplicably rich texture and just-perfectly-undercooked rice, to the flavour of the mushrooms, not forgetting the sophisticated inclusion of the artichokes (served lightly grilled on top) to provide some zing, this was simply a top-notch dish, anytime, anywhere. That it was found in this modest vegan caf is something else.Creamy Pesto and Zucchini Cappellini0My friend said it was delicious but I didnt have a bite looks incredibly creamy. How?We also had a white asparagus and truffle pasta that I didnt try, and dont have a picture of, but heard was equally delicious, though it was without any sort of cream.As should be obvious Im mystified how this place is able to pull off this type of food without animal-based products. You could put that spinach and mushroom risotto up against any non-vegan risotto in town in terms of richness, consistency of texture, and flavour. Its a small odd-looking place with tons of mirrors everywhere, but if this place is really vegan (still cant believe it), you can look at yourself for the whole meal with a clear conscience and a happy stomach. If youre even a bit interested in vegetarian food OR great pasta and risotto, you have to try this place.'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-mirror-vegan-concept/549256?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
458,Miso,Central,Japanese,3.7,260.0,4.0,"Book a place in advance to minimize waiting time. Since we've made a booking, we only waited for less than 5 mins before we were seated. the lunch menu here is quite limited, either various different kinds of sashimi sets, udon sets or the teppanyaki set.Teppanyaki set consists of salad, miso soup, fried rice and 2 mains to be chosen from either salmon, prawn or rib eye roll0I picked beef rolls and prawn today.  salad n miso soup were both average. the prawn was fresh and juicy, just not hot enough. the side of picked peppers was ok. the beef roll tasted good with the sauce and bean sprouts. i liked the grilled asparagus, only complain is there's just 2 thin and tiny ones! the piping hot fried rice smelt and tasted good. score 7/10"", 'Our entire team came here today for lunch. This is not my first time at Miso, but it is the first time I am having lunch here in at least two years. We were thirteen people in total and sat along a row of tables that were put together for us.The restaurant is located in the basement of the Jardine House building. The interior was simple and dimly lit, and the polished finish of our rustic, wooden table lends it a modern touch. At the heart of the restaurant is an open sushi kitchen bar and guests can sit around the bar and watch the chefs at work.The menu books were leather-covered and hot tea was served with what looked like authentic Japanese cast iron teapots (tetsubin). Lunch hours at any restaurant in Central are typically hectic no matter how cozy the same restaurants might be in the evening. With attendants being overstretched trying to rush from place to place, the ambiance was slightly chaotic. We often struggled to catch the attention of the waiting staff, but overall they were courteous and have worked hard to satisfy our needs.The menu presents a traditional selection of Japanese dishes. Although most of the items are in the raw fish, sushi or grilled seafood categories, they also serve beef and pork to cater to a wider audience. For lunch, the price range is around low 200s to mid-300s, although some of the shared lunch sets (for two) cost a little more if you want greater variety and less hassle in deciding what to have.As this place names itself Miso, I naturally went for the grilled miso-marinated cod ($215) that is otherwise also one of my favorite Japanese dishes. I ordered it separately  la carte, and paired it with a fresh salad with yuzu vinaigrette dressing ($78). Alternatively, you could have the grilled cod with sashimi (around eight slices of an assortment of three mid- to low-tier-priced raw fish), white rice and dark miso soup for a lunch set price of roughly $270.Most of my colleagues sitting near me went for the latter choice. The white rice glittered like shiny pearls under the warm lighting and they were small, round grains with a serving size that most of my female colleagues were able to finish.My salad came first and it was served in a very large bowl. Most of it was lettuce and frisee, but it also contained radicchio (red leaf chicory) and bright tangerine-orange cherry tomatoes that were exceptionally sweet. The leaves were fresh, and the dressing was refreshing and authentic.The miso-marinated cod was probably grilled on a teppan or a pan. There is some skill in preparing this dish, as the cod needs to be marinated in miso and sweet mirin one to two days in advance. A slight error with the proportions of the mirin and the miso could lead the fish to become irreversibly bitter, and the miso in the marinade could easily burn if it isnt removed from the cod before grilling. My grilled cod was cooked with perfect timing for a silky texture that is not overly dry. The flavor was just right with a subtle taste of miso, and the grilled fish was served with a big spoonful of daikon oroshi (grated radish) to offset the fattiness. In terms of portion size, this was also a generous helping compared to a lot of the restaurants I have been to.Our only complaint would be that they werent attentive enough to remember each of our orders and each time they came around with a dish it took us a while to figure out who ordered what. With such a chaos, it was only inevitable that one of us took the wrong lunch set. The waiting staff then informed us that it would take the kitchen another 45 minutes to redo the dish. In the end, my colleagues were forced to swap. The difference in time between the first and the last dishes served was also hugepossibly a half hour gap. Hopefully they would manage the logistics of a larger party size better in the future.'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-miso/7678?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

A+the skillet-fried meat dumpling  is unusual in having a coating of sesame seeds on the bottom (fried surface). it is not as crispy as the traditional plain bottom. the meat filling inside tasted below average. B+the fried pancake with scallion  is another of my favorite in this restaurant. plenty of sauteed scallion inside. the pancake is thick and very crispy on the outside. every bite is yummy. A+the stir-fried, shaved shanghai rice cake  has a great tasting sauce that makes the dish above average. the thinly cut pork pieces are tender and well seasoned. Athe fried beef cake  is a new item. the filling includes minced beef and onion, blended in a juicy sauce. the outside is crispy. this new version is like fusion of the traditional version and a hamburger.

The appetizer was good  well seasoned and with a nice portion of the shellfish (I guess some sea snail). Pork was ok in taste, but could have had more ginger. I didnt like that there were some bone pieces in the pork (like in a strip of bacon), which made it a bit difficult to eat. Rice was ok, the pickles were standard supermarket quality. Salad was quite basic  a few leaves, cherry tomato and a bit of corn and the dressing very acidy.Given the long queues at almost every restaurant at lunch time in this area I would see this overall as an ok alternative for a quick lunch and decent value for money, might come back at an earlier time to have a bit more selection.The bento box0The bento boxMiso soup?0Miso soup?Ginger pork0Ginger pork'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/admiralty-morikawa-bento/456540?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

All seems well as I ordered the classic pastrami with fries and a side order of creamy coleslaw.The wait was short as it was ready for pick up in 5 minutes. As it was a sunny and warm day I thought I would eat outside by the fountain. Everything looked right when I opened the box and was looking forward to my first bite...Well the brisket was too salty and heavily seasoned. Also the brisket was cut wafer thin and it was all pre sliced in a big metal dish which I saw at their preparation area. It wasn\'t even busy then and they couldn\'t be bother to slice it fresh on order.Back to the brisket, my mouth could only taste of saltiness as there was no beef flavour at all! I was so tempted to throw the sandwich away but did not have time to buy another lunch before my meeting so I tried to keep going... The fries were hot but it was too tough and had no crunchiness on them whatsoever. I took a couple more and gave up the rest The sandwich I managed to finish but regretted it afterwards as I was so thirsty and drank almost a litre of water.The only decent thing about the meal was the coleslaw, the vegetables were crunchy and the dressing was just right.If that is the quality they consistently served how on earth do they manage to stay in business?

However, I realised their menu is more limited, and there was no soup selection which was disappointing, as I do like a small bowl of deli soup to accompany my sandwich. I also tried to deviate from the norm and ordered a breakfast bagel instead of a sandwich with fries.  The portion of fries were large, too large, for a single person. Next time Ill come with more people just to split these fries, which were alright, crisp but a little greasy. I wish theyd just give half salad/ half fries, or just make the meal 10-15% cheaper (I know - wishful thinking) The bagel was just ok. Overall I thought the melted cheese, buttery scrambled eggs, bacon was already rich enough, but they completely ruined it by adding mayo. When all the ingredients are naturally rich - mayo just took made it too gross. The bagel itself had a light coating of butter/oil - also not needed. I will stick to the classic sandwiches next time, but also see if I can go to the Central branch instead.Bagel with fries lunch set - ...enough Fries for my whole family...0Bagel with fries lunch set - ...enough Fries for my whole family...Breakfast bagel - Too greasy0Breakfast bagel - Too greasy', 'This is a neat deli.

I rarely eat it and prefer to get something lighter most days, but once in a while you can't beat a lil' slice of heaven.I went there during lunch time with a friend who considers herself a bit of a pizza connoisseur, so since it was a place that she has suggested before, I felt it must be a good choice. We both went for the lunch deal, which seemed pretty good value at 128 hkd, which included a starter and main. For the starter, we both chose the corn on the cob, which wasn't bad at all; crunchy, spicy and light enough to ease you into the main.corn on the cob0corn on the cobFor the mains, we chose the 'Bacon corn' and the 'Soppressata Picante'. The Bacon corn didn't come with tomato, so it was more like a cheese bread, but you can choose to add tomato if you really want to. Both were generally ok I thought, the dough was light and cooked well enough so it was a tad soft to cut into -opposed to burnt and/or crumbly. The Soppressata Picante was the nicer of the two as it had more flavour and a little spicy kick to it, though it was a little sloppy, from the runny tomato base. If I had a suggestion it would be to cook the top of the pizza a little longer so it binds together better and taste much better if the cheese was slightly crispy.Soppressata Picante0Soppressata PicanteThe actual place itself was nice and clean and the staff were efficient and attentive.FINAL VERDICT:For a very filling lunch at a reasonable price, it's definitely worth a try!"", ""It's one of my favourite restaurants in Central. They baked the pizza with a stone stove which gives a slightly charcoal flavor to the pizza.

The company was great, and the food was top-notch (I would recommend in particular the iberico roast pork and the peking duck, both of which must be pre-ordered, as well as the Sichuan-style fried chicken and the scallop/prawn dumpling). The service was also generally impeccable with people refilling tea and water often and being polite and courteous with us.The problem arose when it was time for dessert. Most of us ordered ice cream, but it took over 15 minutes for the ice cream to arrive. As the minutes went by I became more anxious as I had another appointment, and asked for my ice cream to be served in a takeaway package. 10 minutes later the ice cream arrived, literally as I was getting up to leave. I asked again for my ice cream to be put in a takeaway box and a male manager very rudely and abruptly said, while staring daggers at me, ""ICE CREAM NO TAKEAWAY.""I didn\'t have time to argue with him as I actually did have to leave, but the restaurant\'s slowness in serving ice cream (what, were they making it from scratch back in the kitchen??) and the manager\'s rudeness really left a poor taste in my mouth. Had I had time I would have demanded a refund because it\'s ridiculous that they don\'t have e.g. Styrofoam bowls to serve ice cream takeaway and also it was totally unnecessary for the manager to have been so rude. (I was neutral in my tone and demeanor so it wasn\'t like I provoked or deserved that type of response.)  Also, when I first asked for my ice cream to be put in a takeaway box no one said that would not be possible.As it is, we had to pay HK$99 (45 per scoop plus 10% service charge) for ice cream that went wasted because the restaurant staff were too slow in serving ice cream and too inflexible to serve it takeaway. The manager was so rude too. He shouldn\'t be in the service industry with that kind of attitude.Mott 32, your food is good but this is no way to treat customers.

Thankfully I was a guest.... and I took no chances at not savouring all those lovely dishes I've been oogling on this website.First up, the char siu. Tender, juicy, just the perfect amount of fat where you can taste it, but you can't see it, and it's so well marbled into the meat that you think you're just eating lean meat that's awefully succulent.

Oh, and go for the deluxe/supreme version.Deluxe char siu0Deluxe char siuThen it's the roast pork belly. Crispy crackling, melt-in-the-mouth meat, perfectly seasoned. Bite-size delights.And then some. The fatty, creamy, wobbly stewed lard-on-flesh was flanked by a few verdant crunchy broccoli and topped with crispy sliver-thin slices of radish? (whatever it was, it was brushed aside pretty quickly), and the tower fell apart at the slightest prod of a fork, it was THAT good. The skin was cooked so that the texture was almost collagenous and didn't taste greasy at all. The meat put me in a stupour. So yum.Hualian slow cooked pork belly0Hualian slow cooked pork bellyThen the Peking duck which I had requested the day before. Despite the duck being decently sized, there was surprisingly fewer slices of skin or meat that I had expected. I could have taken the carcass home and done some serious damage to it with my fingers. The wafer-thin wraps came in a steam basket and was individually layered with paper so they won't stick. The condiments were lovely, especially the sweet, dark sauce that replaced the regular hoisin sauce in other restaurants, it was almost like a sweet aged balsamic vinegar. Needless to say, everyone dived in before I could whip out my phone for a shot.Peking duck - meat, skin, both0Peking duck - meat, skin, bothThere were also dim sums such as wagyu beef puff, prawn/crab roe/pork siu mai, har gau, a clay pot of cod with potato and chilli, and a dish of stir fried string beans.

Overall, this place was really way better than  where we usually visited in the same district except for the all-you-can-eat Haagen Dazs ice-cream at .""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-mou-mou-club/46741?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

Ambience was great, the staircase leading up to the restaurant was designed so well I felt like I really was walking up inside a cruise! Lunch set menu looked good except I would hope they had more seafood as an option, as they are famous for their seafood basket.Lobster Bisque0Lobster BisqueSet came with soup AND salad (and I added HK$38 to upgrade the daily soup to their signature lobster bisque).  Amazing soup, strong lobster flavour, smooth texture and very rich in flavour when combined with the dallop of fresh cream  I would come again just for this!Grilled Pork Pineapple0Grilled Pork PineappleOn the other hand, the main course was not so great...I picked the Grilled Pork with Pineapple, I was uber happy with the portion but the texture was very tough, the sauce was thick and sweet with no specific taste, it did not go well with the mashed potatoes underneath the pork, the mushrooms did not go well with the tasteless dish.For HK$128, I would think Wan Chai has better lunch options.  With this said, Im looking forward for change and improvement from Mr. Crab as staff was nice, ambience was good, menu overall is appetising.0', 'Sunday lunch alone so that limited plates could be ordered. To be cautious in the first time at this restaurant, simply tried crab meat carbonara which is my yard for ascertaining food quality in general. The portion size is fine for single person. A raw egg yolk was put on top of the linguine piled in a shape of semi-cone. Slices of bacon and cheese were placed around the cone base. Cream sauce was thick and rich. Crab meat threads were well mixed with the pasta. About the taste: the cream sauce and the egg yolk dominated everything and the bacon occupied my buccal in their hardness and crisp, but the crab meat was almost tasteless implying that they were not fresh and if insufficient quantity. Not worth the $168. Side order was half pint Hoegaarden: always fine but no surprise, of course. 00', ""Went past this place by accident and thought it would be nice to brunch here. It's got quite a good selection of seafood here.0You can create your own seafood bag with your desired sauce (I chose their recommended spicy Cajun sauce) and it becomes this afterwards....0Then the guy shakes it...0Pretty fun to watch. We chose snowcrab legs, mussels and baby octopus. I'd say the portion is reasonable. Despite being pretty oily I would say their spicy Cajun sauce is pretty nice. Unfortunately the flavours cannot penetrate into the potatoes in the seafood bag so I think they might need to figure out a way to work with that. We also ordered a Cajun prawn egg Benedict which turned out to be pretty good (forgot to take a picture). But having that said, this place is delivering good value, with so much food among the 2 of us it was less than $500 and you know usually seafood in HK can be pretty overpriced.

478,NOJO,Central,Japanese,4.5,150.0,,"I had lunch with my colleague at this restaurant for the first time.  Though I did mark my request for a table next to window side when making the reservation via openrice, the staff didnt offer us a window side table and I also noticed that the window side had been fully occupied at the time of our arrival.  We were seated at the chefs counter in the end.  When we were halfway through our meal, there was an incident where a waitress dropped the plates with food on the floor, which also unfortunately spilled some food on my shoes.  Besides cleaning up the mess in a quick manner, the other staff immediately offered us another table and provided me some napkins to clean off my shoes.  One thing that impressed me so much is a male staff who looked like the owner or manager of this restaurant shortly came over to apologize and give us our meal free.  I had never come across with such superb service at any restaurant in Hong Kong before, though similar incident did happen on me for not only once.  Although the food served here is a bit fusion, I can say its service is typical Japanese based on my experience this time. On food, I ordered the eel & egg don set with yuzu ramen, while my colleague had yuzu ramen.  The eel was tender & had no bones.  Yuzu ramen with chicken meatballs was in chicken-based broth with some yuzu scent, where the broth was rich & creamy but not fatty or oily.   Given the quality of service & food here, I must come over again to give other dishes a try!'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-nojo/610909?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw
479,NOM  Not Only Meatballs,Central,Italian,2.9,186.0,0.0,"I have always heard how good the meatballs here are, which made me really want to try them!0Up the slope, then the staricase brings you to NOM. My friend and I were greeted by a lady and were brought to our table. We were the first table there that afternoon.Even when a few more tables came in, it remained quite quiet, so it was quite an ideal location for a catch up lunch.0Shortly after we took a seat, the lady came to take our order, but we literally just picked up the menu.Lunch sets include a starter, main, dessert and coffee/tea for $178. Now here is what we got:Complimentary Bread0Complimentary Bread0. Complimentary Bread This bread was served on a cool stone plate. The bread was fresh and warm, but the butter was an acquired taste.I stared at it at first because it was coated in black stuff. Then, I smelt it and it had such a strong scent. I heard that the black stuff was olive, and I have to admit that no matter how many times I have olives, I still hate them. I didn't like the butter at all, and neither did my friend.01.1 Quinoa with beetroot and baby spinach I had originally chose the smoked sworsfish, but was told that it wasn't available, so I chose the quinoa. I like quinoa a lot but asked them to leave out the goat cheese, because goat cheese is not a cheese I like. The size of the starter was very generous! It was the size of the lunch I used to pack for college!The salad was good, butit was a simple dish that I think I could have easily made on my own. Also, my grandma makes the best pickled beets so I couldn't help but compare.01.2 Beans Soup with Gruyere Cheese and black truffle (+$20) My truffle addicted friend ordered this. Again, the portion was huge. There were so many beans that it was scary. There would be no way that a person wouldn't be full after the soup alone, so maybe it was a good thing that the soup was so salty that my friend had to stop at a few spoons. We could taste no truffle, and the best thing was the cheese stick that came with the soup she said. The waitress asked us how the soup was so we told her the truth, our answer seemed to have caught her by surprise, and she didn't quite know how to respond. Oh well....Meatball Spaghetti0Meatball Spaghetti2.1 Spaghetti Meatballs This pasta dish was the better dish of them all. There were 3 giant juicy balls packed with lots of herbs. The tomato sauce was rich and tangy, which was very appetizing.0What surprised me the most was that there were strands of meat infused in thesauce, which made it even more flavourful.This was quite a nice dish.Ultimate Lamb Meatball Sandwich0Ultimate Lamb Meatball Sandwich2.2 Ultimate Lamb Meatball Sandwich This was a photogenic dish.I was reluctant to try this because of the lamb, but being a foodie I tried it anyways. The meatballs were cooked medium and had that strong lamb taste. The sauce and juicy balls made the soft bun all soggy, which was gross. I was glad that I didn't order this because I didn't really like it. My friend who eats lamb thought that the meatballs were quite good though, so trust her on that. The fries were nice. The colour was very light, so you wouldn't have guessed that they were that crispy. The ketchup on the side was unique. It almost tasted as if it had a floral. taste to it. Ha. It was nice. Nom's Signature Ice Cream Slider0Nom's Signature Ice Cream SliderSet Coffee0Set Coffee3. Nom's Signature Ice Cream Slider and coffeeThe coffee was your regualr coffee.These sliders were cute looking. There were lotus chips on the side with icing sugar sprinkled on top. They were interesting and innovative in a way. Not a regular item you would have for dessert. Both my friend and I were disappointed by this dish. The vanila ice cream was good, but the bun was dry, and worst of all, the citrus fruit smeared at the bottom was awfully bitter. The waitress took our dish away before we finished our chips. The service was soso.Final Verdict:I feel like I whined about every dish I had. I really don't know if I went at a wrong time, or their food doesn't match my taste. Although a bit pricey for lunch, you definitely won't leave hungry."", ""I always wanted to try this place after I read about it in a magazine describing it as a restaurant that served meatballs of all kinds. And more. I decided to try out them out for lunch on my day off.Layout is dark and quite bar/pub like. Dark wood tables and floors with black sofa seats. It felt like a great evening drinks type of place.During weekdays, they have a lunch set menu that costs $178 with no service charge (however, $1 is added to your bill to donate to a charity). It includes a starter, main, dessert and coffee or tea. Lunch crowd is well ... the place was empty except for another group. And this was 1 PM. So, if you want a quiet place for lunch, this is it.I decided on the quinoa salad for my starter and ultimate meatball sandwich for my main.1Bread platter with olive paste butter. Bread was presented to me on a pretty rectangular gray plate that looked like stone. Bread was ok. Nothing exciting about it. But what made this mind blowing was the butter. I normally don't like using butter on bread but I noted that there was this black ring around the butter patty. I wasn't sure what it was until I tasted it. It was black olive paste. When I spread it out with the butter on my bread, it took it to a whole new level. It was fragrant and .. blew my mind.bread with black olive coated butter0bread with black olive coated butterQuinoa with beetroot, baby spinach and goat cheese. I didn't expect the portions to be so huge. There was so much quinoa, it was a meal in itself. The goat cheese was creamy. Everything I love about goat cheese. The baby spinach was crisp and soft. The quinoa was light. The beetroot's tartness gave it a nice balance from the richness.quinoa salad0quinoa saladUltimate meatball sandwich with fries. Plated on a wooden chopping board for that rustic look. The first time I had a meatball sandwich was in this Italian deli in Little Italy area of Melbourne. It was the best thing I ever had in my entire trip to Melbourne. After that time, I've been obsessed with finding a great meatball sandwich. When I saw that Nom claimed to have the ultimate meatball sandwich, I had to try it out. Verdict? Not as good as the place in Melbourne, but pretty close. The meatballs were soft and cooked to a medium rare. It was packed with herbs. The tomato sauce was tangy and rich. It soaked into the soft sandwich bread. Biting in, cheesey strands strung out into my mouth. It was pretty good. The fries were super crispy and not oily. I love that they gave me a good small saucer plate full of ketchup.ultimate meatball sandwich0ultimate meatball sandwichLook how beautiful it looks inside!0NOM's signature ice cream sliders. Isn't this the cutest thing ever? Beautifully presented on a tiny cast iron plate, a tiny hamburger with a ball of ice cream with fried lotus root. Dusted with powdered sugar. The lotus root was crunchy like chips and great when I dipped them into the ice cream. The ice cream was vanilla in flavor and very creamy. It had a spread of yuzu in it which gave it a bitter tartness that balance all the sweetness. The burger bun was actually cake. This was not only cute but delicious.ice cream slider0ice cream sliderI was so full afterwards. I actually couldn't finish most of my meal. I was that full. This is definitely a great place for men or those with a huge appetite. Will return and would recommend it to friends especially certain male friends of mine who eat nothing but meat and no veggies."", '0Foodie knows the key to a perfect bite, always stays with \'a bit\' meat, \'a bit\' cheese and \'a bit\' well-done sauce. Who cares that a lot! Especially you know you will be treated with a rich selection of fine ingredients and a good cooking way. NOM, opened about 4 months ago, is kind of place I described above, and I\'m very happy to listen to the Chef\'s words where I figure out the resto is proud of their qualified selection of imported raw materials (including vegetables) and the way they are making magic with those good ingredients in their secret kitchen.0Burrata | Heirloom Tomato | WatermelonThe main purpose for this visit is for their newly launched Lunch Menu, cost $178 (no service charge) which is only served in weekdays so far. Even you can find one item featured with their (already) famous Meanball, the new Lunch Menu actually has more highlight than where the fame is already. The power behind is, a double-fresh idea (to me), which stands for fresh ingredients plus fresh cooking.Of course, you could order from a-la-carte menu as you wish (but I would say their Lunch Menu setting is more than enough to feed you up). Burrata is one of those out of set menu. With a fresh and juicy companion of watermelon and tomato, we were swimming in the creamy, slightly sweet and milky Burrata (cream and mozzarella - inside part) without even a second of \'drowning\'.0Roasted Pumpkin | Yogurt Dressing | Sharp Cheddar It\'s a fantastic but simply presentation with all my favorite ingredients, which I believe even you are piggy and insisting to healthy diet style, you won\'t say ""NO"" to this one. The roasted pumpkin cut into a cute large boat-shape which impressed me by its crispy hard biting experience; not flavored a lot even solidly whitened by yogurt dressing. It tasted amazingly light with a strong nuts aroma, and the only salty flavor came from the cheddar, which is hard, semi-dry, firm and of course, cheesy and delicious enough as its dry cheese way.0Quinoa | Beetroot | Baby Spinach0Sweet Potato | Sea weed salsa verde | Red onion | Oyster mushroomThe other two starters are awesome as well and as usual, to be a combination of healthy vegetables, lightly roasted and salad. To select any one out of those 3 starters, I would say nothing will go wrong whatever in its taste, presentation or physical diet theory, to color a little more about last point, is all of them are roasted, olive oil dressed, and contained enough fiber.0Ultimate Meatball SandwichOne of the main course choices and I\'m pretty sure, if you go for this one to continue your Set Lunch in NOM, you will be over-satisfied in mind and by stomach. I simply love the way they are dealing with this Meatball Sandwich. The dry, crispy and awesome bread aroma, checked! The very-evil looking of meatballs and melted cheese \'coat\', checked!The thin, light golden French fries, checked!A bite, I had a hint of fresh sweet tomato sauce in a right level of sweet and sourness to balance the meaty and cheesy side, juicy and soft pork & beef meatball, and the all-around cheesy taste, not too heavy nor too sticky, but just flowing everywhere.1Prawn SlidersAnother awesome dish from the regular menu is Prawn Sliders. The color wowed us a lot, and it is not difficult to have a successful guess about what\'s coloring those cute mini-bun. Yes, it\'s beetroot, a perfect healthy, sweetening and coloring ingredient. The mini-burger is not as heavy as sandwich, while in terms of that thick piece of pan-fried foie gras, the hidden fat you would take from it would be the same or even more. Anyway, it\'s delicious  The soft and smooth taste of prawn cake made with smashed potato and the full prawn instead of chopped or smashed ones. A rich flavor of juicy, rich and mouth-melting, but everything has a little connection with sweet, which makes a bite more complicated and interesting. The homemade chips are dressed with seaweed and salt.0New Zealand Short-RibsCompared to the outstanding Meatball Sandwich in the set menu, short-ribs might lose its glory. I\'m not keen to its fat part so much, while the taste is not bad, mildly salted with a little smoked and roasted aroma.0Homemade Tagliolini | Crab Meat | Parsley Root PureeTime to take some traditional Italian food (pasta!) and I was again impressed. The homemade tagliolini is eggy, chewy and in a flat-shape but also twisted a bit itself. It is perfectly matched with the melted cheese on the top and parsley puree at the bottom. I really wish to have more bites but just too full already.0Ice-Cream SliderAnother slider, but in sweet way. It features Basil Cardamom Ice-Cream and Kumquat Cardamom jam, to give a very fresh mint-like taste. Perfect finishing after a big meal!Supplementary Information* Set Lunch $178 (no service charge) includes 3 courses & 1 coffee/tea'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-nom-not-only-meatballs/174224?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
480,NOVE Chinese Kitchen,Central,Chinese,3.3,203.0,,"FoodFor a restaurant with a Michelin star sibling, it has a long way to go. The menu selection is limited, which I understand given the restaurant size.  The only positive feedback is that the dimsum came hot (as it should). The thickness of their dumpling wraps / flour rolls could be more delicate, need to work on their condiment selection (hot sauce, xo sauce), and the shrimp in the flour roll only had crunch but lacked flavor (i.e. missing garnishes). The ""goon tong gow"" was clear and flavorful, but nothing tastes good if the service is foul.  ServiceThe service was beyond appalling, their staff unprofessional. Not only did they check their mobile phone during service, some staff had very poor attitudes towards their patrons, and if they don\'t like you they have no hesitation to let you know this. All in all, a very unforgettable experience and one that I would not wish on anyone.  I will never visit this restaurant again.', 'Quick squiz:New on the block, still a hidden gem. A friend noticed its new opening and we decided to visit for a weekday lunch. Food was top notch and its obvious they\'ve made an effort. Same goes for service. It\'s also apparent that they have considered their decor to match their overall theme, exuding a classic elegance exceeding the quality you might have expected in a modern interpretation popping up in this lane.More about the Restaurant:1Restaurant wasn\'t particularly full when we arrived shortly before 1pm. But then again, it\'s still very new to the extent that the flower placards are still at the entrance and it does not even have an Openrice page as of this writing.Onto the food... we were a table of 2, ordered 5 dishes and were extremely satisfyingly full afterwards. All were carefully put together. While all of the dimsum were good, the highlight was the sliced goose.0Pan-fried conpoy turnip cake ($33)This was pan-fried nicely - a slight crisp to the surface with good turnip content but not too overwhelming. One of the better turnip cakes you\'d have and a warming reminder of the new year delicacy. Recommended.0Steamed vegetarian ""eight treasures"" dumplings ($33)A dimsum classic. Supple dumpling skin wraps around an exciting mix of vegetable texture inside make this a welcoming dish. Recommended.0Steamed egg white and crab meat dumplings ($42)This was a recommended dish in their menu and thought we\'d give it a try. the overall texture was soft and supple - perhaps a little too much that it was sometimes hard to tell the difference between the dumpling skin and the contents. Taste was good. Can be improved by having the crab meat appear as strands so that it can be distinguished while in the mouth. Consider it.0Rice flour rolls filled with crispy seafood roll ($59)Maxims (and I\'m sure other places) offer something similar. The portion to this is smaller than Maxims. It\'s more intricately made. The crispy batter layered between the rice flour and the seafood roll is finer (thinner) than Maxims, as is the rice flour, making this dish feel like a more intricate and hand-crafted version of Maxims iteration. Recommended.0Sliced goose ($199)Very generous portions, well laid out The meat was warm, moist and tender with a hint of cinnamon powder sprinkled on top. I have not had a sliced goose dish so caringly prepared in a very long while. The tofu underneath was smooth and rich on flavour, albeit a little soft. Highly recommended.0Tea ($18 per person)This felt a little steep but it\'s a staple and hard to be missed. Aroma of the barley teabag was good and lasted throughout the whole meal.Restaurant was playing some popular classic Cantonese tunes in the background, completing the experience. Unfortunately the music appeared to be an afterthought as it was playing through what appeared to be a set of Bluetooth speakers placed in a corner. There was also quite a bit of background noise making it not the most quiet of places, a little unsettling, but far from being of any concern when it comes to conversation.Service was polite, attentive and well thought through. For example, they poured the soy sauce on both sides of the plate of the crispy rice flour roll, rather than directly on top. They cleared the table promptly of finished dishes and added water to the pot efficiently. It was a nice touch to remind us to have the food while hot when they serve each dish.My only real gripe to service is the lack of any napkins (wet or dry) as is typically the case in Hong Kong, which I was told were being sold for $5 a pack. I declined as I\'ve always found it absurd for restaurants not to provide napkins. This would be fine in a \'char chan teng\' environment, but I would certainly expect more at this price point. To their credit, they did bring over a box of tissues and allowed us to take a couple from it.All in all, it\'s obvious they\'ve placed a lot of thought into it - from the decor, music and service to the food. I\'d be eager to come back to try out more of their other options. In honesty, it\'s not easy to find something like this in modern Hong Kong. Hopefully they\'ll have free napkins soon...010'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-nove-chinese-kitchen/636629?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

We both ordered a Teppanyaki Special at a price of $460+10% which really seemed to be quite a good deal in such a location. I remember I had the same set at my last visit but the items were slightly different. I remembered there was a big prawn to choose from last time. The set included a salmon sashimi, green salad, butter flavoured scallops, sirloin or sliced sirloin steak, assorted vegetables, fried rice or fried noodles, pickles and soya bean soup.

They were delicious ice-cream scoops with sweetened red bean. It had definitely gave me a great end to the big feast.Service was ok but I had expected more given that it was a 5-starred hotel. Not the problem of the chef but more the servers. I remembered that service was also so-so during my last visit so I sincerely hoped that they would work on this for my next visit. The ventilation could have been better as I stink the whole afternoon after my visit.

Food has always been decent and service of high standard as you would expect from a 5 star hotel.We tried their teppanyaki this time and were not disappointed. The set meals were decently priced (compare to the other top teppanyaki places) . A set lunch is around 400 bucks.The chef had decent cooking skills and ensured all the food were well cooked and nicely presented.', ""Always make reservations here. It is a popular place for businessmen and women to have client lunches.It's definitely a better value to eat here for lunch with their set menu's. My favorite is Gyuniku Koumiyaki. However, they also have pork cutlet, they have sushi/sashimi set menu, they have udon and crab omelette on rice set menu, beef teriyaki set menu, etc. I also like their handrolls - negi-toro and california. The first time I liked eating Uni sushi is from Nadaman. All their food are fresh.If you sit in the Teppanyaki counter, they also have a teppanyaki set menu - including your choice of beef, your choice of seafood, etc, depending on how much you are willing to pay. It comes with fried rice or fried noodles at the end of of your teppanyaki.If you sit on the sushi/sashimi counter, you can order either a set lunch or directly from the sushi chef on your choice of foods.This restaurant also offers dinner set menus, including shabu shabu dinner set, sukiyaki dinner set, etc.If you are specific with your choice of foods, they also offer a la carte menu."", ""For a business lunch Nadaman is definitely a popular location, being one of not many options in Admiralty. We managed to secure a table for 1.30pm booking the day before,and we arrived promptly to be greeted by two ladies in very pretty kimonos. After some time of looking through the menu, I was stuck between a couple of lunch sets, but in the end went for the Hana set ($390), whilst my dining partner went for the Beef Teriyaki set ($390). In the Hana set: Appetizer - Cold Spinach in a light stock - simple, tasty, I wanted more!Sashimi - There were two types of fish and sweet shrimp. All were fresh and especially the shrimps which were quite large and juicy. Miso Soup - The miso soup here was not salty despite the dark brown colour, but very boring. I think if they added something -  negi or mushrooms or even diced tofu it would've brightened up the soup a little....Chawanmushi  - One of the best! The cream-yellow coloured custard was silky smooth and there was a fresh bouncy prawn inside along with some sliced mushroom. Lightly flavoured and delicious.  The china spoon they gave you to spoon it with was also really nice. Cod - Arrived looking quite dark and unfortunately slightly over-cooked, so the cod didn't flake as easily. Nonetheless the sweet and salty marinade was quite balanced and the fish went really well with the rice =)Tempura  - I was most disappointed by the tempura I was served. It looked nice - thin batter and all, but none of the pieces out of okra, eggplant, shiitake, 2 shrimps and eel had that light crispiness I was looking for... Rather, they were quite oily and the pieces I let sit for a while had an unappealing chewy texture. Rice - The rice was no less than chewy, sticky and plump Japanese rice - perfectly cooked. Dessert - assorted fruits in a jelly. A light sweet ending, but definitely can improve on the appearance - it was a glob of jelly spread on k top of diced fruit in a wine glass....As for the beef teriyaki, it came medium as requested, and the set came with the same spinach appetizer and also an all-greens salad and miso soup. Although I didn't get to try any of it, I was told it was good and very substantial. The hit-and-misses in my hana set definitely disappointed me a little, but the hits were excellent. Nadaman has a good reputation with manyi, so I'll be back to see if it was just an unlucky day!"", ""There is no doubt in my mind that this is one of the best Japanese restaurant in HK. Both the Tenshin (dim sum) and Lady's sushi set were exquisitely presented and represent Japanese cuisine at its very best. All the ingredients were super fresh and cooked just right. A  true Japanese feast for the eye as well as for the palate ! (Note that the Tenshin set lunch also included a bowl of rice with , a miso soup and a small dish of appetizer, apart from what was shown in the photo)Considering the high quality of the food, the nice environment and the 5-star hotel restaurant service, we think that the meal is a real bargain.

In short, don't try!(Mushroom)1(Mushroom)This one had a stronger flavour, but still lacked sufficient miso flavour.0A tea blend available only at this restaurant. They blended seven types of Japanese green tea, including  and  by their secret ratios. The aroma was supposed to be smooth and unique. It tasted pretty fresh like green tea. But it was quite bitter towards the end.0Roasted at a high temperature, this tea was made of leaves and stems of sencha. The tea's bitterness was largely subtracted by roasting at high temp. The aroma was supposed to be delicate and refreshing. I found this one better than the other, smelling so good and less bitter!Mini matcha jelly1Mini matcha jellyReally so mini than expected. The matcha jelly was so smooth with a slight matcha taste which was just right and not bitter at all. The red bean paste was so yummy and the level of sweetness went along well with the matcha jelly.

I personally found  offering foodstuff of better quality in general. I wouldnt go back again to try other products here. In addition, the staff was not so friendly or helpful despite the lack of queues on the day we went.

486,Naked Gurume Gyarari,Central,Japanese,3.2,130.0,0.0,"Naked is pretty high up on the mid-levels escalator. I guess one of the reasons why it was pretty empty during lunch hour. The decor inside the restaurant also hinted that its more suitable for dinner as all walls where painted black and servers uniforms were also black. Only thing that could be considered bright or cheerful were the servers there.0They have a pretty focused lunch menu, 7 mains to choose from. For starters we had quinoa salad and scallop miso soup. Soup was standard; salad was fresh  crunchy veg with goji berries to give it the Asian flare and lots of quinoa to give texture. Unfortunately they used too much sesame dressing. It was too salty to eat the last few pieces of lettuce as they were soaked in the pool of dressing.1For mains, we had Mount Fuji and Naked Sashimi Donburi. Mount Fuji was prawn tempura sushi roll topped with a bed scallop sashimi and quinoa coated with mayo dressed in their lava sauce (hot sauce). Supposedly the more creative dish in the menu. I think the lunch chef forgot to put the kombu flakes and seaweed flakes as listed in the menu - we didnt see them when the dish arrived. They probably wouldnt have an impact on the taste anyway, only there for aesthetic reasons. The tempura prawn was soggy, probably made way in advance so they could be efficient with the lunch crowd. The roll was wrapped very loosely and fell apart as soon as your chopsticks touched it. The scallop and quinoa topping saved the otherwise very bland dish, yet you can tell the scallops were not fresh.Mount Fuji0Mount Fuji0Naked Sashimi Donburi was rather disappointing. You think they would put more effort in the dish if they put their name on it, but no. Uni was very appallingly pungent (you know, the unique smell/taste of stale uni). They gave us very generous portions of yellowtail tuna and big eye tail tuna but both lacks personality. Quinoa was very chewy and personally I didnt think it went well with the rest of the ingredients. Tried too hard to be a fusion dish, but failed.Sashimi don0Sashimi donThe sets came with tea or coffee. Two meals came to $271, we couldn't finish the donburi. Price was okay but maybe Im not a big fan of wannabe fusion food, maybe their true potential is only realised in their dinner menu, I wouldn't bother walking so high up for lunch at Naked.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-naked-gurume-gyarari/168169?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

When my secretary mentioned that she liked these noodles, I had to try. The following review is based on take-away as I have not visited the outlet yet.Their main attraction is noodles (there are different types) with ""spring rolls"" which are not traditional spring rolls but are really fish patty rolled in bean curd and fried. There is quite heavy seasoning. The taste is very captivating and texture very pleasant. The customer gets to choose the variety of noodles as well as soup base and the degree of chilli (if any). If chilli broth is what you opt for (and I recommend it), there is a great deal of chopped chilli, chilli oil and spices in the soup base, plus chives, green onions and bean curd. Makes a very flavourful and hearty lunch. Remember to have soup and noodles in separate containers for take-away as this prevents the noodles from getting soggy.'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-nam-kee-spring-roll-noodle-co-ltd/2407?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

Upon entering the restaurant, it seemed they kept the same layout and furniture as well. It seemed they didn't bother to redecorate. Seating was comfortable and not cramped at all.I was presented with a lunch set menu. Menu is in English, Chinese and Japanese. They had a variety of everything Japanese. From sushi to curry rice.

It just tasted like regular steamed egg from a Chinese restaurant.0The udon was chewy and not over cooked. But the soup tasted more like water.0It also came with a miso soup. It wasn't exceptional and pretty much forgettable.0When my set first arrived, they gave me assorted sashimi rice and not what I ordered. When I told them, they quickly removed it with an apology and less than 5 minutes later, they gave me my correct order. But this was not even good. The tuna had a slight fishy taste. The spring onion was only that little bit on top. The rest was regular white onion. That was not on the menu. And a LOT of sesame seeds. So much it was all I tasted.0Now, that I write my review I noticed the listing was once called Hal's. I really did not like Hal's. So now they have just renamed themselves, offering the same mediocre Japanese food for a price range where you can get something better elsewhere in Causeway Bay at lunch time.

So I was stuck at 1230 on Father's Day with no booking for anywhere. Then I remembered this restaurant from attending an exhibition earlier this month. This is a new(ish) restaurant at the Convention Centre which I am sure most people do not know of and sure enough i got a table. I didn't know what to expect and my father had no idea I made a cock up. He wasn't even surprised we were going to the Convention Centre for lunch. Anyway, I was relieved to see the place was quiet and nicely decorated and the tables were not closed together. But it was a strange that a table for 7 was a long table made up of square tables.Anyway, we ordered quite a lot of dishes:4 starters cold braised sliced beef flank- one of Dad's favourite dishes. Was told it was quite nice, I am not keen on this dish Smoked fish. Again more Dad's favourite dish and he said was nice. Anyway, it was finished, so it must be Thin marinated bamboo shoots. My daughter's favourite and it was very tender and fresh tasting Mock goose in bamboo sheets. I have had this dish in countless places and this is a good example, not the best. 3 dim sums Read on Openrice that the shao long baos, soupy dumplings were very good, so I ordered 2 portions. Sure enough, they were extremely good. Piping hot, the dumpling skins very thin, full of tasty soup inside and the meat was not fatty but had a nice pork flavour. Wor Tips or pot stickers were also very good for the same reason. Lots of soup inside which is not normal and crispy on the bottom. The dough was not too heavy or thick. One of the best wor tip dishes I had Vegetable buns. These were not good enough. The best has still got to be those at Chekiang Club, the large version. Maybe these were small and it's hard to have enough vegetable fillings inside.  For the minced pickled vegetables and pork dish, we ordered sesame packets and flour pancakes to go with it. My daughter likes pancakes but I like sesame packets. The sesame packets were particularly good as they were very puffy, light and not doughy inside like in the old fashioned Peking and Shanghainese restaurants.  Fried long beans with minced meat was not overly deep fried, so you can still taste the sweetness and juicyness of the beans. Everyone liked it Crispy chicken with spring onion sauce was like a deep fried Cantonese chicken dish with spring onion soya oil on top. Unexciting but goodBraised fish head. Although one of Dad's most favourite dish, by the time this arrived, he was full. Others tried and liked the flat rice noodles under it.

Main course: I ordered a sweet and sour fish, my wife and son ordered lemon grass pork, my daughter ordered sushi in rice with vinegar.

I have no doubt that the grandeur of the establishment was once a sight for sore eyes for the elite across hong kong but it has hopelessly lost touch with the world today.  I went there for the semi-buffet business lunch.  The restaurant looked tired, the decor is way out of style, the wood panelling on the wall is way off for a restaurant that charges 500 a head for lunch. The semi-buffet reminded me of what Isola used to have (but that place is full of wankers) but a lot worse, hell, the chef had already began packing up at 1.15pm!  I had the vongole pasta, the portion was tiny and the taste was ok but not ""oh my god for a $380 bowl of pasta it blows my pants off"" kind of sensation.  The desert was so unremarkable that I cannot even remember what I had. I have to give the level of service 5 out of 5 though.  The staff were extremely attentive and efficient but my god - have you seen their uniform? a dull off apricot shade blouse (shirt for gents) with brown pants, not fitted or anything but drapey.

Tsui Wah.Menu is in English and Chinese. There is no 10% service charge and everything is in a set that includes a drink. You can choose sushi rice bowls or grilled meat ones much like Yoshinoya. There is also udon as well.1The restaurant is pretty big. Bigger than I expected. The set up is much like Cafe de Coral and Fairwood.0Boyfriend ordered the yakiniku pork rice bowl lunch set ($55). Set includes a daifuku. Set drink can only choose miso soup, tea or soft drink. Coffee or tea cannot be chosen. That is only available for the afternoon tea sets. Odd? It looked pretty good when it arrived. They said they used Japanese rice and yes, it was Japanese rice. The pork was only grilled on one side. It tasted good but oddly tasted more like Chinese grilled pork than Japanese.0The daifuku was super soft and gummy. It stuck to the roof of my mouth.0I ordered something from the afternoon tea set. This is the beef udon series ($39). I chose tomato soup instead of katsuo soup. Originally wanted pork cutlet but they made a mistake and I didn't want to change as it was too late an they would have to throw it away. The udon was ok. Smooth and chewy. Soup was not very good. A weak tomato flavor. I should have ordered the katsuo soup. Otherwise it was cheap and ok. The ice lemon tea I ordered was excellent! Full body. Perfect balance of sweetness. And then I realized .. Tsui Wah! Of course! They always make great tea drinks!0I didn't see anyone ordering the sushi items. I am curious how that is. But at the prices aren't cheap and pretty comparable to other cheaper range Japanese restaurants in the area. But I'm still curious on the quality? But as for the other items? Food was ok. Not great. But it was cheap and I'd be back. Boyfriend won't but I would. Service was very friendly. Probably due to fact it's still new.

Got completely fooled by the pictures all around WTC.We had the Caprese Salad and the Honey mustard tuna as appetizers. The Caprese was underwhelming but the honey mustard tuna was awful. Somehow it tasted of chlorine from swimming pool. I'm not sure if it's because they ran tap water to defrost the tuna but it tasted strongly of pipes. It was clearly not very fresh.The star of the restaurant is the hand-made fresh pasta. The pasta was alright in terms of its texture so I will give credit where it is due. We had the sea urchin cream pasta and the Sicily red shrimp pasta. The cream pasta was basically like soup noodles because of all the excess sauce, which made it very heavy and difficult to finish in one seating. The Sicily shrimp was not fresh at all so the meat was mushy and tasted bland.There are so many Italian restaurants of higher quality with much cheaper price in Causeway Bay. I will never go again."", 'I had been interested in this restaurant for a long time. Since my friend is back in the country, we decided to pay a visit for lunch. In order to avoid rush hour, we went there at 11:30. We were the first 2 customers and were given one of the tables facing the sea. The decoration of the restaurant was nice and the seats were comfortable. A few minutes after we sat down, the waitress introduced another 2 customers to the table next to us. The restaurant was empty and there were so many other empty tables in the restaurant, why did it have to be the table right next to us? It was very awkward as the 2 tables were so close that it was like we were sitting right next to each other at the same table! Therefore, to avoid the awkwardness, we asked to change our table. They agreed and took us to another table for 2. But a few minutes later, they asked us to change to another table again. After many unnecessary changes, we were ready to order. We asked for a lunch set salami risotto with salad and soup of the day ($108) and a white truffle cream sauced spaghetti with sea urchin ($198) to share between two. Everything was very ordinary and nothing special about them. We looked forward to the spaghetti a lot. But it came at a rather cold temperature. The sauce was bland. It felt like the sea urchin was only there to make it look special and did not blend in well with the white truffle cream sauce. Sadly, the sea urchin did not taste as sweet and fresh as we expected as well. $ 1981$ 198When we left the restaurant, it was 1:00 pm and there were only 4 tables of customers including ours so far. We enjoyed the sea view a lot. However, with this price, we would like better food quality and service.

It was so refreshing to have with the heavy food we were having.Iced Orange Tea1Iced Orange Tea2. Salad X2 Both of us were not too interested in the daily vegetable soup, so we went for the salad.

Braised Beef Rib FingerI saw this dish on openrice, so I knew I was getting this before I even looked at the menu.  I just really like beef, especially short ribs. The beef was served on a bed of risotto and vegetables. I thought there was a little too much vegetables, but I can't deny that they were cooked nicely and paired well with the tomato based risotto. Now, the beef was just amazing. It was so tender than it melted in your mouth. I loved it.  Braised Beef Rib Finger2Braised Beef Rib Finger4. Mixed Mushroom Pizza This was my sister's choice. She always goes for the mushroom item on the menu. I'm so glad she picked this, because it was very good. Although I don't really like thin crusts, this crust was nice. Maybe because I was so drawn by the toppings that I forgot that it was a thin crusted pizza. The pesto sauce looked like a lot, but it was peefect for the pizza. A little oily of course but light and delicious to eat. Even the colours of the pizza was a sight to see. I would have this again!   I liked this more than my beef.Mushroom Pizza2Mushroom PizzaService was good; from the hostess that greeted us to the people who served us.Final Verdict:It is a place that I would visit again!

Check off what you want with the pencil on the table. Lunch includes a drink. There is no 10% service charge.0My set drink was a milk tea boba. Served in a trendy mason jar. No strong tea flavor. It was far too milky. The boba was a bit too hard.0I chose the braised beef noodle soup ($78). I don't know. Is it supposed to be spicy? The reason is whenever I order this, it's not spicy. But this one was super spicy. There was a layer of chili oil. The beef was not braised long enough so was a bit tough. But the clincher was the noodles. It wasn't even cooked thoroughly. It still tasted a bit raw and it was clumped together. Perhaps that's why they added so much chili oil to it. To cover the taste of raw noodles. Portion size was also not very big. I was still hungry after I finished my meal and I'm a light eater.0Now that I look back the previous reviews, I can agree. This food is not good and definitely not worth a return.

It\'s good that it is finally opening in Causeway Bay which is a lot more accessible. With just 1 min walk from the MTR station, the restaurant is pretty spacious located on the 3rd floor of Kimberly Mall.The restaurant serves Taiwanese food and they don\'t have any lunch set so we had to order from their a la carte menu.O\'casa beef noodle $70The flat white noodle with 3 big pieces of beef brisket and some side veggies like cabbages, carrot and radish. The broth is brown and a bit sweetened, just like how the Taiwanese does it. The noodle is a bit chewy with a good white colour. I also liked that they use coriander and pickled cabbage to give that extra savoury taste and the herby flavour.I would say that the taste is quite authentic when comparing to the Taiwan one. The beef brisket has a chew to it with some cartilages jelly part in each piece. The size portion was just right for one person and I kinda regret that I took too long time to take photos because the noodles got cold a little bit.00The side veggies are completely softened and they absorbed all the flavours from the stock. I really enjoyed the flavour from the broth and it doesn\'t taste like it is filled with MSG.00Beer boiled clams $58The clams are cooked with beer although it tasted a lot like white wine. Both the beer and cream taste are prominent and flavourful. It\'s not too salty nor too creamy which I like because I always consider this dish as one of the light dishes to have. The restaurant uses a very classic way to prepare clams and they have used a good amount of garlic flakes to prepare their fresh clams. The clams itself has a very strong powerful strong seafood taste. For $58, I would say it is a very enjoyable bowl of clams to share with friends.00Purple taro smoothie $38Basically a taro milk tea blended with a generous amount of tea. The taro taste is similar to other Taiwanese restaurants with a bright purple colour. It tasted okay but I really wish that they can blend the ice until more finely because it is giving me a lot of brain breeze with that many pieces of ice pieces in the drink.00Irish coffee (cold) $34Lastly, we were actually very surprised that there is ""irish coffee"" on the menu. (YES! The restaurant does have alcohol license and serve some selections of alcoholic drinks!) Their Irish coffee doesn\'t really have a noticeable alcoholic taste but it still has a very flavourful coffee flavour. We have noticed that they do not use coffee power / instant coffee mix. They use real freshly grounded coffee beans to make their coffee. From their open bar, you can hear and see that they would prepare their coffee made-to-order from scratch!The taste is a bit sweetened with some cream on top. You can as for a less sweetened drink up front if you are not a fan of sweet food.00Apart from your favourite TW dishes, we highly recommend you to try their coffee because it\'s not common to see this good quality of coffee in a Taiwanese restaurant.00000'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-ocasa/512180?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

Being the well-organized person that I\'m, I\'ve already got our lunch plans all figured out. In fact, I have secured a table at Old Bailey (), a new restaurant by JIA Group over a month ago.0First impressions are always important and we have a very good one here, with everyone loving the way they decorate the space with a lot of wood.

Nope, I'm not a convert yet wrt natto. My friend Y, who is Japanese, informed me once of the benefits of eating these slimy things (including grated yam, okra, natto, and seaweed). Improves the blood vessels or something. Maybe that's why Japs are all so healthy and live so long. But. I...natto...no.None of the elements are particularly flavorsome. On top of a generous serving of pearl rice (yay!!) sits boiled okra, lightly seasoned cooked seaweed, shredded nori, natto, a blob of slimy grated yam, and a raw egg plopped in the middle. No seasonings whatsoever. It was as bland as anything. Given that I don't like raw egg (which I removed before diving in), there really wasn't much flavor to my bowl. So I liberally applied this sweet soy sauce on my don, which improved the taste slightly.For those who don't care for slimy food at all... stay away, because that's the sensation in every bite. Even your lips become gluey and sticky.The good thing about this meal is the alleged health benefits. That's why I brought myself to finish almost everything. And it was surprisingly filling! Bland, flavorless lunch except the slightly putrid natto...even if it's traditional and authentic, me boat no float.Conclusion:Will return to Ootoya for other dishes, which are pretty decent. Glad I tried something new though."", ""Ootoya's Causeway Bay branch used to be across from Times Square and now it moved to the MidTown.

I don't know why they served the salad on top of the rice? The potato salad was horrible. I really don't like potato but I love Japanese potato salad. But this was really bad. It just tasted like cold bland starchy mashed potato. The salad greens were ok and the tomato was nice. The chicken meat balls were alright. Nothing really bad or good about them.0Set came with an onsen egg. It nice. Especially when mixed with the rice.0Appetizer was green beans with miso. It was ok.

516,Operetta,Admiralty,Italian,3.2,259.0,0.0,"My wife and I decided to grab a quick cheap lunch in Pacific Place, so we weren\'t expecting much.  I was late and my wife had already ordered, and the appetizers had already been served by the time I arrived.The environment was ok.  Two men sat down and ordered just after I arrived.Apparently, after we had finished the appetizers, the waitress served our main courses to the two men next to us, who happened to order the same main courses.Needless to say, we ordered first.  So I kindly asked the waitress to check on our order.  She came back and said they needed another 5 mins.  I said ok - not like there was anything we could do.Then another waitress came by and quite impolitely said ""We just need another 5 minutes ok?  Sorry!"" and walked away before we could even respond.  Perhaps she saw the disgruntled look on my wife\'s face and didn\'t want to apologize sincerely.15 minutes later, our food arrives.  The lasagne looks like it had been through a radioactive meltdown and the chicken my wife ordered was not fully cooked.Not bothering to eat this rubbish, I asked for the bill and left immediately.Not recommended.  Better go to McDonalds for a happy meal than this.', ""Operetta, one of my go-to restaurants at Pacific Place has just launched a new lunch menu this week. As I knew I would be in Admiralty to get my heart checked out this afternoon, I thought I should go and check out that menu at the same time.0This is a much more simplified set lunch menu they've got now with fewer appetizers (from 8 to 6) and main courses (13 to 8) to choose from. Out goes my favorite appetizers including chef Konishi's teriyaki wings, fried Nagasaki cuttlefish and manzo tonnato and in comes stuff like beef carpaccio, grilled white asparagus with Hollandaise sauce and pan-fried tomino cheese. Pretty interesting change but honestly, I don't really care as long as the new stuff are all good.00Beef carpaccio - I could smell the truffle from pretty far away. A server then walked past me with this in her hand and I knew immediately that it's going to be a pretty fragrant dish.Beef carpaccio with green peas puree and summer truffle sauce...1Beef carpaccio with green peas puree and summer truffle sauce...While I wasn't surprised by the lovely fragrance of the summer truffle, I was somewhat stunned (but in a good way) by the thickness of these tender slices of beef. They were not razor thin as I thought they would be. In fact, it was considered pretty meaty for a carpaccio. I really like this dish a lot especially the little dabs of green peas pure and summer truffle sauce on top giving the carpaccio more greater complexity of flavors.0Tiger prawns - This was a fairly good but undersized dish featuring a pair of tasty tiger prawns. It was served with a pizzaiola sauce along with some sauted French beans on the bottom. Reasonably good but it was no comparison with the previous dish.Tiger prawns with pizzaiola sauce and sauted French beans...0Tiger prawns with pizzaiola sauce and sauted French beans...I didn't get the chance to check out their dessert menu coz I was too busy taking off for dessert elsewhere.

I will definitely come back for their lobster campofilone sometime soon."", ""Operetta kicked off the gastronomic renaissance at Pacific Place late last year that would see a slew of new restaurant openings (Apinara, Commissary, Bizou, Dim Sum Library etc.) coming through the door to the famed shopping mall in Admiralty over the past 6 months. I have always enjoyed the modern chic design of Operetta so right after my short trip to Taipei, I decided to pay this modern Italian restaurant my second visit.0Marinated salmon with Sicilian style couscous - Getting things started was marinated salmon with a small fennel salad on top and Sicilian style cous cous on the bottom.

That's pretty good value for a restaurant of this caliber in the heart of the city."", ""One of my favourite restaurants in Hong Kong was two Michelin starred Wagyu Takumi, which until recently was helmed by renowned Japanese Chef Mitsuru Konishi.I'd heard that Chef Konishi was involved as culinary director of the newly opened Operetta in Pacific Place, but was completely surprised when I learned that Chef Konishi had made the break with Wagyu Takumi to take a more hands on approach at the more casual Operetta, as well as (rumour has it) a brand new fine diner restaurant.We'd been watching the saga that surrounded Operetta unfold, right from the controversial decision by Pacific Place not to renew the lease of previous tenant Dan Ryan's, through to its recent opening. As frequent visitors to Pacific Place, the snazzy little restaurant held a mild interest, but the early reviews didn't set the world alight.So we waited.The right opportunity presented itself recently when we caught up with a mate of the girl's for lunch; looking for a casual and close spot, Operetta seemed the perfect place and so we finally made a reservation for a Sunday lunch.0With a name like Operetta, you'd have to be oblivious to the know that it was not an Italian restaurant; what is less obvious is their approach to stretch the concept of Italian cuisine, looking to break the traditions of contemporary flavours and expectations. Risky for sure, people love their traditions and it's not easy to tease people out of their preconceptions when it comes to food.Arriving right on time for our reservation, we were shown through to our seats. The first of my many expectations about Operetta were blown away; I had no idea how big the restaurant was and how far it stretched back. Walking by gave no indication to the size and layout of the dining room. I'd been fooled into thinking the front bar area was the bulk of the restaurant.0I didn't particularly love the interior; I felt that there were too many conflicting styles that didn't marry together. Orange comfy chairs sat opposite velvety bench seats that seemed right out of the 70's - with lime green seats no less!; wood paneling on some of the walls further built on that feeling and by the time I noticed the crazy wallpaper at the end of the restaurant, my feeling that I'd stepped back in time was complete.0The booth that we were sitting in was comfortable enough though, and as we waited for our dining companion, we were given a bowl of bread along with huge menus to look over, one of which was a special white truffle menu. We had plenty of time to peruse however, the girl's mate PL was late, very late. He'd had trouble getting a taxi and wasn't too sure when he'd be able to get over.0Super hungry and with an unmovable engagement after lunch, the girl and I decided that we'd order an entree while we were waiting, the Red Tuna Tartare with 'Tosazu' jelly sounding particularly appealing. The simply presented tartare was bright and vibrant, the red of the tuna clearly dominating the plate. Usually a dipping sauce, the Tosazu jelly surrounded the tuna, giving an extra red effect that was offset by sesame seeds and seaweed grapes. I loved the freshness of the tuna, it was lovely and sweet, superbly enhanced but the twang of the accompanying jelly, which lingered on the palate for some time.0By the time we'd finished the tartare, PL had arrived, so we set about introductions and chatting before making some serious decisions about lunch. Given the menu for Operetta was wide and eclectic, it was quite amusing that the girl and PL picked exactly the same thing and I ordered one of the special white truffle options.My choice was the barley risotto with Alba white truffle, which originated in the little northern Italian town that is renowned for its aromatic white truffle. It was a bit pricey, but when the truffles were presented to us, and that wonderful umami aroma hit, I suddenly didn't care so much about the price. More-so when our waiter started shaving the delicacy over my risotto, the mound of shaved truffle engulfing the plate and completely hiding any evidence that a risotto was on the plate.0Let me just say, the aroma was intense, sensational and mouth watering; so much so that we all took turns taking in the wonderful scent. When I finally set about devouring the dish, the earthy flavour of the truffle perfectly accentuated the benign flavour of the barley risotto. The risotto itself was expertly cooked, but truth be told, there was too much truffle and as a consequence, the balance was slightly out. I don't want to say there should have been less truffle, that would be sacrilege; but there definitely needed to be a bit more of the risotto.0The girl and her buddy had been a little boring and chosen the homemade Fettuccine with traditional Southern Italian meat rag. Now I'm definitely assuming that the rag was made with beef, and not the more traditional horse meat; but whatever the protein was, it was rich and full flavoured, hints of its tomato base shining through with the meaty taste. While the sauce was delightful, there were a few problems with the fettuccine, mostly due to the fact it was a little thick, and as a consequence was under cooked. Not so bad that it was inedible, but enough to comment on and detract slightly from that wonderful rag.0Interestingly, the menu described the dish as a ragout, which is more traditionally associated with French style stew; where rag is Italian and more generally associated with pasta (although not exclusively). So, there was a little contradiction that probably needs to be resolved; a Japanese chef with a specialty in French cooking and a menu that describes the dish as traditional Italian.....Even though we were running a little late for my next appointment, we decided that dessert was definitely on the cards; and this time we each ordered something different, leading to a little more diversity.First up was PL's Millefoglie, an Italian version of the traditional French dessert (the mille-feuille) and it looked quite spectacular on the plate. Borrowing a little from the styling of the world's top restaurant, Osteria Francescana, there was a splatter of bright red coulis decorating the plate, along with some lovely saffron pastry cream sandwiched between a couple of pieces of pastry topped with fresh mango, saffron and finished off with a blood orange sorbet. The dessert was fresh and creamy, with punchy flavours from the blood orange sorbet; although there was perhaps a bit of an imbalance with the saffron, leading to a feeling that the dish was a bit spicy.0The girl chose a slightly more traditional Italian dessert, the vanilla pannacotta. The very busy looking plate was less than traditional though, the pannacotta topped with fresh fruit, a strawberry tuile and squares of marshmallow; a berry coulis surrounded the pannacotta like a moat. You can tell a great panncotta by its wobble, and while there was a good amount of wobble with the Operetta version, it was largely diminished by being covered. Never the less, it was a delicious dessert, the sweet dessert balanced by the fresh fruit and coulis, and texture from the tuile.0My dessert was quite interesting, in that it looked kind of old school in its presentation, achieving that stacked look that seems to be making a comeback. A creamy coconut tapioca was covered with a mango cake, fresh mango and finished with a near perfect sphere of passionfruit sorbet. I'm really digging tapioca at the moment, so found the creamy concoction with the little spheres of cassava root quite refreshing, especially when paired with the slightly sharp hit from the passionfruit sorbet.0There were clear signs of the French slash Japanese influence of Culinary Director chef Mitsuru Konishi, there were huge elements of Italian head chef Fabio Sgro evident too. A young chef who'd previously worked in a number of well regarded Italian restaurants, including Restaurant Marcela (one star), where he was the executive Chef and L'Albereta Gualtiero Marchese (three stars).However, there were also clear signs of a restaurant that hadn't quite found its feet yet either. The eclectic menu covered a wide range of options that looked and sounded interesting, but were maybe a little too diverse and challenging for its Pacific Place location. With seemingly minor errors with the description of some of the items on the menu, possibly as a result of language and translation issues, it was hard to gauge exactly what the restaurant's style was.Japanese, French or Italian; or maybe I'd missed the point and we were looking at a blending and fusion of three the world's most popular cuisines?Either way, there were enough signs that pointed to Operetta starting to carve out an identity and find its place in the world. I liked the flavours of my selections, there were a heap of extra menu items that I'd be interested in trying and the prices were reasonable from chefs the caliber of Mitsuru Konishi and Fabio Sgro.Given its close proximity to my apartment, and the fact that it's right by my local cinema, I'm more than likely going to be back for more. It will be interesting to watch this place over the coming months and years!@FoodMeUpScotty0000000"", 'Operetta is a young and contemporary Italian concept serving food beyond traditions and beverages beyond expectations.

This time, he\'s teaming up with chef Fabio Sgr to offer some of the best Italian comfort food including pizza, pasta, charcoal grilled meats and pastries.0I like the fact that they\'re open at 11:30am which is perfect for someone like me who don\'t believe in having a big breakfast.0Some bread to start me off while I wait for my appetizer.0From the dcor, I thought this is going to be a fine dining restaurant but they\'re definitely not kidding when they said casual dining. Just look at my appetizer - deep fried chicken wings with sesame seeds and dried chili.1It was a little difficult working on those three chicken wings on such a small plate with my fork and knife. But somehow I managed to ""debone"" each and every one of them. This was very tasty. The seasoning was a little on the heavy side but I like it especially with the added flavors from the dried chili.0It was a tough call between their artisanal spaghettini and pan fried cod fish but at the end, I decided to go for something from the sea. This was a similar type of black cod fish I had at CIAK In the Kitchen a while ago. They were serving it with a celery root pure and brown butter sauce which was an excellent choice.1The 2-course set was well priced at $260 ($65 to add a dessert).

The portion sizes for the mains is small as well, you would think the salad buffet would either be cheaper with a bigger main for lunch or perhaps a more extensive buffet spread for the price they are charging.Aubergine Parmesan - Flavourful0Aubergine Parmesan - FlavourfulThe eggplant Parmesan was delicious. Soft and bursting with flavour. A good balance of tomato sauce and cheese. I could have eaten a much bigger portion....Calamari - Tasty0Calamari - TastyThe calamari was cooked perfectly. The breading was light and had a nice smoke to it giving it a light charred flavour. Definitely also could have had double the size portion as I could have eaten this all day long.Overall the main courses I had were delicious. The salad buffet was adequate but not worth HKD198. I am sure the food during the night would be of high standard as well but probably quite pricey. For simple Italian focusing on fresh ingredients then they do it very well. If the cost was reduced or mixed up the lunch buffet from its current concept then I would definitely come back more often, but for HKD300 there are plenty of other better options for lunch during the week. So I give it a thumbs up for taste but thumbs down for value.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/wan-chai-osteria-marzia/546246?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

One of my friends had a recent surgery and is on a strict diet thus he wanted something healthy, ie. no cream sauce and not a lot of oil. After browing through the menu, he settled on the penne pasta. My other friend ordered a steak while I was the adventurous one and ordered the fish tacos as the picture shown is bursting with colourful vegetables.The starter of soup was extremely salty, I can bet it was a pre-packaged product or at least the stock base was. The thousand island dressing which came with the mixed salad has already changed colour on top, again, this is shop bought. I would like to remind everyone that Outback pride itself in making their own sauces when they were first open.We were immediately looking at each other as soon as the main dishes hit the table. My friend's penne has half an inch of oil on the bottle of the pasta plate, so much for healthy eating so he left most of it.The steak was tiny but considering the price, it was fine.Icould not believe my eyes when I saw the tacos as the taco shells were soggy, tough and inedible, they did not even hold their shape and they flopped about on the plate. The fillings were even worse, only a few strands of onion and a few cubles of peppers, a very big depart from the pictures on the menu. The salsa on the plate has no seasoning and tasted like hospital food. The rice is the highlight on the plate, it has flavour from the dry herbs and quite spicy but quite greasy.All in all, a very bad meal.I understand people do not pay the full a la carte rate at lunchtime but the food was truly awful.

522,Ozawa Japanese Restaurant,Central,Japanese,3.6,110.0,5.0,"It was our second visit already so we knew how hard it was to get seats here for lunch. We called to make a reservation just like 1 hour ago and still managed to get a table at 1p.m. Lucky us!We waited for a short while before we managed to get our table. As usual, this small restaurant was full house and the only waitress was very busy running around serving food, taking orders and tidying up table. It was not our first visit so we understood what service level to expect. Anyway we were coming for the food but not the service so it was ok.Lunch Menu2Lunch MenuWe ordered 2 . Price was really good given that it was Central and there was no service charge! Both of us ordered  and  as we remembered how good they were last time. It took us quite a while to choose the other two. We finally decided to go for  and .0Very soon after our orders before the arrival of tea, chopsticks etc, this one arrived already! At first we couldn't tell what it was and was even wondering whether it was some sort of appetizer. When we were told that it was , we were quite disappointed because the portion was so tiny. You could tell that it could possibly be some leftover by other people before us given the speed of arrival...Anyway, the quality was so-so. Would never order this one again.0After waiting for quite a while, these two finally arrived. I actually tried to weigh it on my hand and it was so heavy! It was stuffed with rice and loads of sashimi. Although the sashimi was not really fresh, it was ok given the portion and the price. There was even some little scallop on it. The rice was hot though. It was very moist which was the type I liked but it was not sour enough.0As soon as I finished my diced sashimi rice, these 2 arrived. They smelt so good of fatty fish oil. There were 5 thick pieces! They were cooked outside and sticky inside. Really meaty & yummy! My tongue really enjoyed eating them. They went great with the rice!0This dish was served really hot. Yummy!The miso soup came in the middle of my meal as the waitress didn't have time to serve us earlier. They were just normal miso soup.Green tea & sweet potato ice-cream0Green tea & sweet potato ice-creamIce-cream was included in the set. We tried both flavours. The green tea ice-cream was much better as the sweet potato ice-cream didn't really taste like sweet potato.Although we both had a big stomach, we did feel full after our meal. Would definitely come back again for the good value-for-money lunch set later!"", ""Found another goooooood JP food in Central  ( if you do follow my post, you know i am always finding good sashimi rice in Central )Let's see photo first!0My colleagues know I love JP food so much and bring me to this restaurant.Most ppl here would order this mini don set.

So for girls, you may also some salad or side dish for the other choices.PS**You have to reserve table for lunch time as the place is small and so many people coming."", ""I saw the reviews on this little jap diner and was so attracted by the lunch set menu so I came to give it a go There were two of us and we ordered a 3-item-set each. Here are some photos:0First item: The sashimi rice was made up of salmon and hamachi pieces. The proportion of sashimi and rice are just right. The sashimi was of decent quality considering the price, but obviously didn't impress particularly.As each of us gets 3 items, it's enough for a petite girl like me. However 3 of these added up might not be enough to fill up a bigger guy's stomach.0Second item: scallop sashimi with homemade(?) spicy sauce on riceI was looking forward to this a lot, however the sauce just simply didn't deliver. It was too strong, and its acidity was too overwhelming to bring out the freshness and sweetness of the scallops. The two didn't go well tgt. However the portion was satisfying and the scallops were of decent quality.0Third item:This was definitely the best out of the 6 we ordered. The salmon were grilled perfectly on the surface and the inside remain only half cooked, giving the fish a nice char-grilled taste while keeping the texture soft. It goes really well with the rice and they served generous portions of the salmon. 0Fourth item:Unagi on riceThis was pretty good too and the sauce was lovely. But there were only 2 small pieces and I wanted more. Enough said.Fifth item: fried shrimp rollsThese were just ordinary and unseasoned, hence lacked flavour. I'd have preferred those form Genki.Sixth item: chicken teriyakiThese were good and they gave us chicken thighs which were succulent and tender. The flavour was what you'd expect of chicken teryaki. Generally happy with this dish.They also served miso soup and a scoop of ice cream which are included in the set. Both were satisfactory. The sesame ice cream I ordered was a delight, while the green tea ice cream was a disappointment so I wouldn't recommend it.The space was tiny and could hold 10-12 ppl at most so it's not a place where you'd stay for too long. Each set costs HKD$100.00 with no service charge required. This is a better deal than anyone could ask for a jap lunch in central district, considering the quality!Conclusion: If you're looking for high quality stuff, this isn't the place to go. however, it's a SUPER GOOD DEAL and is a place to consider when you feel like trying out tons of different stuff all in one set at pa low price.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-ozawa-japanese-restaurant/57169?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
523,PAPI,Causeway Bay,Italian,3.5,196.7,0.0,"I've walked by Papi quite a few times while looking for a place for lunch but every time I walked by, it was fairly empty. For a new restaurant, this usually means one of two things for me. It's either too expensive or it's not very good. Causeway Bay is busy. Practically every restaurant is full or at least half full on during lunch hour. This intimidated me so I would walk on by. But then I was curious. Reviews were positive so why not give it a try?I arrived on a weekday lunch time and as usual, the place was quite empty aside from two other people. The restaurant is very pretty. A clean and refreshing blue and white theme with plenty of natural sunlight.I was presented with a lunch set menu. Menu is in English and Chinese. Lunch sets include an starter, main, dessert and coffee or tea. Price was $88 - $128, depending on type of main. To me, that is a fair price as most places cost around that much now a days.0They started me off with papadums drizzled with pesto oil. Hmm...this is supposed to be an Italian restaurant? Why give me papadums? If this is supposed to be some sort of Italian flatbread, then I'm at a loss. They definitely aren't supposed to be crispy like crackers. These were definitely papadums. Whatever the case, it was ok with me. I did like them and the pesto oil was nice.0For my starter, I chose an Italian mussel and clam tumeric soup. Tumeric is more commonly found in Indian and Asian dishes so I'm starting to wonder. Is this Italian Indian cuisine? But anyways, the soup was good. A nice clean broth. There were bits of mussel and clams found. But it could have done with a bit more seasoning to give it that extra boost.0My main was a braised seabass with potato and cherry tomatoes ($128). It looked lovely. The plating was comforting. The fish was cooked well. But sadly? It had no flavor. Did they completely forget to season it? Meanwhile, the potatoes were super salty. But it wasn't all the potatoes. Just a couple. The rest were bland.0The dessert was a tiny panna cotta. Not creamy at all. Way too much gelatin was added so it gave more jello-like texture.0A beautiful restaurant. Wonderful service. But the food? Lacked flavor. It looked beautiful but I felt like saying ... do you know how to spell S.A.L.T.??? Now I know why it's always so quiet. Don't think I'd be back even though I know friends who'd like places like this. I guess I can always shake my head no."", ""Sometimes, when you're walking around Causeway Bay, it seems impossible to escape the crowd. However, just a little off the main streets, you can find this picturesque restaurant that serves fantastic Italian food. The environment itself reminds me more of a furniture shop than a restaurant, and the interior design is very comfortable and suitable for long conversations.00I visited during lunch hours and I decided to choose from the lunch menu.0We ordered 2 sets of lunch, which included:-- Smoked Duck Breast with Orange and Italian Walnut Salad --This salad was a mixture of salty and sour. With the savoury duck breast and the sweet and sour oranges, the combination was appetising to say the least. The walnuts mixed into the salad also gave it an extra crunchy texture, and made the dish more varied.Smoked Duck Breast with Orange and Italian Walnut Salad...0Smoked Duck Breast with Orange and Italian Walnut Salad...-- Sauteed Shrimp with Parsnip and Anchovy Herbs --Whilst normally I'm not a major fan of salad, I can say that this one definitely exceeded my expectations.

The meat was lean, which made it even better, because there's nothing that I like less than a mouthful of oil.0Roast US Short Ribs with Rucola and Pomegranate0Roast US Short Ribs with Rucola and Pomegranate-- Homemade Tagliolini Pasta with Oregano Tomato Sauce and Parma Ham --There aren't many places that serve good Tagliolini Pasta, and I'm not surprised that the one place I found it in was one that made it by themselves. The pasta was cooked to al dente, and mixed with strong and rich tomato sauce, which was sour, but with sufficient sweetness to balance it out. It was a good choice to mix in parma ham bits as it also added the savoury element into the dish.0-- Complementary Red or Ice Tea --0Other items that we were given/ordered included:-- Complementary Starter --I believe that this was the papadum, which was crunchy and crispy. Some thought it was a little salty, but to me, it was just about right.0-- Sauteed Spinach ($88) --I absolutely adored this dish and practically finished all of it, because the spinach soaked in the seasoning so well and it was addicting. It was also served with delicious potatoes that were poached and later sauteed, which was such a highlight to the dish and I simply can't express how much I love this dish!sauteed spinach$ 880sauteed spinach$ 88If you choose to arrive on times other than lunch times, they also have a selection of other food:000"", 'Some of us are already taking off for lunar new year vacation next week so we all agreed to have our celebration meal a little earlier this year.

I had a hard time picking one and i landed on the hawaii pizza, the classic one with pineapple and ham. I was very lucky to, by coincidence, had fresh batch of pizza. They sell them really quick and pizzas come flowing out of the kitchen.Although they sell REALLY LARGE pizza, people usully buy individual slices.

The sauce is ???OK???, very simple tomato sauce. The topping is good. Another bright side is the cheese, which lifts the whole pizza together.

Even when I think of other things I like-- say fried things-- if you put them on a sandwich they\'re even better.One of the disappointing things about Hong Kong is a lack of sandwiches. Scratch that-- it\'s not that there aren\'t sandwiches, it\'s just that they\'re not any good (exception: Fresh in LKF). But I had heard that Paisano\'s has good sandwiches, so I made the trek to the escalators today to give it a go.First, some background. I\'m very picky about mayonnaise. I don\'t ever like there to be a lot of it on something-- things that have too much mayonnaise are gross-tasting and inedible to me. Second, I like mayonnaise on very few things. In particular, I can\'t stand it on anything with beef or pork (hamburgers, roast beef sandwiches, ham sandwiches...). And I don\'t like it on anything hot, like a burger or a toasted sandwich. Warm mayo turns my stomach.I understand that not everyone shares my distaste for mayo. That\'s fine, but I like it (a) when I\'m informed about whether something has mayo on it and (b) when I can request and receive no mayo. I\'ve in the past complained about ""sneak attack mayonnaise"" where mayo is not listed on the menu, but it comes on the item (usually a burger) anyways. I don\'t like that.I was pleased that Paisano\'s is clear that their sandwiches come with mayonnaise. I was also pleased that the woman who took my order accepted my request for ""no mayonnaise."" I was not pleased when the sandwich came:Mayo0MayoHopefully you can make this out in the picture. That\'s the sandwich slathered in mayonnaise right next to my receipt that reads ""no mayonnaise."" I could have returned the sandwich, but it took them 15 minutes to make it, I spent 15 minutes walking there and 5 minutes in line, and I really didn\'t have another 15 minutes to wait for them to make another one. I have a job.It\'s jaw dropping that a pizza restaurant, of all places, cannot handle special requests. What if you want extra cheese or onions on only half the pizza? Can they do that? It doesn\'t seem so.Paisano\'s Super Sub0Paisano\'s Super SubThe super sub comes with ham, genoa salami, mortadella, and provalone. The Italian meats are very good, though a little bit salty. Provalone is one of my favorite sandwich cheeses.On top of the meats is a salad of lettuce, tomatoes, pepperoncinis, black olives, and onions. It has Paisano\'s ""secret sauce,"" which is a funny way to spell ""oil and vinegar."" In fact, there\'s so much secret sauce that while eating, my plate collected a big pool of oil and vinegar.The bread was plain white bread. Nicely toasted, but not at all impressive.I don\'t know what I would have rated the sandwich if it had come without mayo, as I requested. Maybe I would have liked it. But globs of warm mayo all over cured pork? I couldn\'t eat it. I ate maybe half my 6-inch sub. It was just so unappetizing.

All in all, I highly recommend them."", ""I went to Paisano's in Wan Chai with my friend for a quick lunch. I had heard of Paisano's a number of times, but had never actually dined in one of their branches before. When I arrived, there were a lot of people lining up. However, the line moved fast and we were able to order in around 5 minutes. I wanted to order either their Vegetable Lasagna or the Spinach Calzone, but the cashier told me it would take at least 30 minutes for it to be done, so I ordered the Four Cheese Pizza Slice ($45) with Milk Tea ($10). I know it's not the best combination, but I had a sore throat that day.My friend had their pepperoni pizza.I was quite happy with the service: We got our food just minutes after placing the order. My tea did arrive a bit later, but I didn't mind because I was a bit preoccupied with my pizza. My slice arrived only slightly warm, which was a tad bit disappointing because the cheese wasn't as melty. The Four Cheese Pizza was indeed very cheesy, but I think the best part was the tomato sauce base. It was very good. It would have been better if there was slightly more of that tomato sauce on the pizza.The slice was HUGE, which is a plus, so one was more than enough to fill me up.The milk tea was good too. I liked the fact that they did not put any sugar in it, so it gave me control over the sweetness. I didn't put any sugar, and it was great.Overall, I would dine here again. However, there were not that many seats in the restaurant. My friend and I were lucky to get seats there. The food was good, and the service was fine.Supplementary Information/"", ""Today I walked past Paisano's near the MTR exit at around 12pm, I was surprised to see that there were not much people compared to the crowd that I usually see near 6pm, I was immediately tempted for a pizza treat since I was alone today and didn't have anyone to have lunch with.  Despite that I've already been here a few times, I've always ordered the godfather because it's so, so, sooo good! I really gotta try their other flavours someday, the 4 cheese looks pretty appealing too.0I love how they reheat it for you and it still tastes just as good, there are plenty of fillings and they are spread out pretty evenly on the pizza so I can get a taste of the fillings in every bite. The crust is pretty thin and has a nice soft texture, so it might not satisfy those who like a good crunchy pizza, I personally don't really like crunchy pizzas so this is perfect for me! 0The godfather is kinda pricy at $40 per slice, but I think it's totally worth it because of its huge size, I can barely hold it with one hand and obviously it's more than enough for lunch or even dinner. You can't really compare the pizza here to those chain pizza stores because even though it's huge, I don't get that greasy feeling after finishing the whole slice!"", ""I have eaten a lot of pizza in a lot of countries and in East Asia, it is not always easy to find a true pizza. This New York-style slice joint is by far the best pizza I have eaten in East Asia (a crown worn by Mike's Pizza in Chengdu, China up to this point). The pizza base is crispy and chewy in the perfect proportions. A good test of a base is whether it would be a good bread without the topping - a test easily passed by Paisanos.We usually opt for the classic pepperoni and it has the perfect proportion of cheese (not too much) to tomato (a thin savoury layer). It is well balanced and is a slice of comfort food made in heaven (actually Hong Kong!).If you are looking for a pizza in Hong Kong, this is THE place (or any of the other great branches).

It\'s a \'cozy\' (read, cramped) little place, and you might be best off if you can take away and eat elsewhere, but the demand reflects a level of quality. I\'ve heard people complain before about the service, with no real order and too much time, but they seem to have sorted this (I was given a number, and the food was served to me downstairs).As everyone has mentioned, the slices are huge (1/8th of a 24"") pizza, and the prices are good ($25+) for a slice. Additional toppings are $5, which is a good option if the $25 \'cheese pizza\' is too boring.For me this is a new standard of pizza in hk.', 'SERVICE (0.5 out of 5) I have been waiting to try this pizza place for a while and finally got a change to go with my wife.  Wait was 20 minutes.  I had ticket #13, but they called number 12, 14 and 15 before us  (we did not have any special order or custom pie).  Just as we are about to pick up our order, one of the staff walks behind my wife trying to deliver 2 steaming hot pizza slices and spills it on her back and leg.  Luckily she was not wearing shorts.  While the staff member is busy apologizing to the person whos order she just spilled and cleaning up the floor, there was no help or napkins provided to help my wife.  Just a quick non-convincing apology from the cashier behind the register was provided.  FYI, tomato sauce does not come off white clothing, so that is going to the garbage bin.FOOD (2.5 out of 5) The slices are large, it is defiantly quantity and not quality (FYI, mushrooms are not fresh).  Great for late nights when you are wasted and want something to fill your belly, but NOT a great lunch place.  Tomato sauce is well spiced, but the tomatoes could have been chopped more finely.  Crust was a bit dry.If you are wondering, I lived in NYC for 7 years and I know my pizza.COST Two Pisano slices and a soda costs HK$100.  Above average cost for the quality of food you get.', 'I went here today since I was in the neighborhood. I went around 5:00 PM, neither lunch nor dinner time, but there was still a lot of people waiting there to get their pizza. I had to wait about five minutes or so until the lady even came back to the cashier place to take orders. I ordered a slice of their 24"" Hawaiian pizza to go. I waited for around ten to fifteen minutes which is actually quite a long time for just once slice of pizza. I was order no. 26 but others with orders 28 and 30 with around 3 to 6 slices got their orders earlier than mine!  I thought this was pretty frustrating. The service really could have been faster. Hawaiian Pizza Slice ($35)The size of the pizza looks pretty big and intimidating but, considering you usually eat 2 or 3 slices of pizza for a ""normal"" sized pizza, 1 slice of this giant pizza is a good portion size. The pizza is quite thin so it doesn\'t fill you up too much and make you feel really heavy. The cheese is really nice and melty, the toppings are okay, although it could always be a bit more generous. The only bad thing about the pizza was that there wasn\'t enough cheese on it, and also it was pretty greasy; I had to blot away the grease before I could eat it. Otherwise, though, the flavor is great.I would definitely come back here again to try their other items like calzones and, when they have it, their cannolis. Their pizza slices are also quite a good value.'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-paisanos/48665?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

To celebrate my return to health, I thought I should do something special for today's lunch and visiting a restaurant I've never been before sounds like the perfect plan.I have heard a lot of positive reviews on Palco Ristorante's 3-course lunch set over the years but was never keen to pay them a visit.

It was disappointing though to see that the $188 lunch menu had many items with supplemental charge. A coffee also had an extra charge of $28 on top of the set. We were first served with a bread roll and a breadstick. I liked that the roll was served warm but the taste of both the roll and the bread stick had a very sweet initial taste, which was off putting. For my starter I got clams with seafood broth. It was really delicious. It was served with a piece of garlic bread which was a pleasant contrast to the bread basket and a hearty complement to the dish. I ordered the pasta for my main which was a spinach fettuccine with mushroom cream sauce and it was also absolutely delicious. The pasta was fresh and with good texture and the mushrooms were good quality too. This was probably the only dish that didn't have a supplemental charge as it was a vegetarian pasta. It was made well though, with decadent toppings like Parmesan foam and Parmesan crisps. To get an a la carte dessert there was a supplemental charge but they do offer a small dessert inclusive of the meal. Unfortunately it was just a spoon's worth of tiramisu with a berry sauce, which I thought was not a good enough experience for the meal. Overall, I am likely to come here again for dinner to try another one of their pastas but I will not be returning for lunch. 000""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/wan-chai-palco-ristorante/185492?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
531,Panino Giusto,Causeway Bay,Italian,3.7,163.0,0.0,"I love a quiet place for lunch and in Causeway Bay it's nearly impossible. Until I found this place. Located in a new wing of Lee Garden is Panino Guisto. Originally from Milan, they opened their first branch in Central. Now they have a new branch in Causeway Bay. Like the name suggests, it specializes in panini.The Causeway Bay branch is a beautiful quiet solitude. With lots of wonderful natural light from the shopping center, I can see myself being quiet a regular.Menu is in English only. Staff also only speak English. You pay (cash only, no 10% service charge) at the cashier and they bring the food to you when ready.Ice Mango Peach ($45). When this arrived, I was a bit taken aback. I expected them to just give me a glass of ice tea. But instead they gave me this contraption! A freshly brewed tea bag was placed on top of a jar of ice. After a few minutes of steeping, you are to pour the entire thing into the jar of ice whereby the ice will melt and ta-dah! Ice tea! This made the tea fresh and cooled naturally. The tea used was quite good. A light mango taste that wasn't too strong. It smelled fragrant. If I was at home, I think I would have touched it up with a drop of honey or agave.0Milano 2015 ($118). This was one pretty expensive sandwich. Consisting of 24 month Parma ham, Romaine lettuce, artichoke cream, Parmigiano Reggiano cream, balsamic vinegar flakes and rocket lettuce. But it was really excellent. The ciabatta was toasted just right. The bread was fragrant with the right amount of chewiness that I like. The parma ham was rich and savory. The mixture of the artichoke cream and Parmigiano Reggiano cream was interesting and went well. Interesting they made the cheese into cream format. The best was the use of balsamic vinegar in flake form to give it that bit of acidity to give the saltiness some balance. And the use of flake form made sure this sandwich held together properly without being soggy. A bit expensive but so worth it.2They have lots of other sandwiches as well as dessert. I may return for dessert some time as I love Italian food.

Really worth a try."", 'Late Sunday afternoon lunch with the girlfriends. I ordered their signature Tartufo and a Cappuccino.First of all, the service was a real letdown. The lady at the cashier seemed to deliberately avoid making any eye contact - much less smiling - and stared grumpily at her cash register, answering our simple question of whether any set menu was offered and whether soy was available for the coffee with dour ""No""s. Seriously, maybe one would expect such service at Lin Heung Teahouse, but an Italian cafe at IFC? Thus began a bad experience.Tartufo: To be honest, I couldn\'t understand what the fuss on this was about. The bread was decently crispy, but parts were made soggy by the olive oil dressing, and it was definitely not piping hot as hoped, but rather lukewarm. The parma ham was good and not overly salty, which tends to be a problem for parma ham sandwiches. Two miserable extremely thin slices of brie were given, and tasted as though they had been left at room temperature for a tad too long. The serving was large, around 20% larger than an ideal lady\'s size, although probably just right for the gentlemen. In summary, the taste was not memorable, and although better quality than Pret, certainly not deserving of a $88 price tag.Cappuccino: To give the place some credit, this was quite well done, and even a bit chocolatey (more sweet than bitter, so may suit those with a preference for sweetness and less acidity). It came with a tiny bit of chocolate covered ice cream which was a pleasant touch. However, the serving was definitely on the small side, about half the amount of a regular Starbucks cappuccino (closer to a babyccino size).If you wanted a quick sandwich, I\'d suggest Pret offers better value for money. The only plus about this place, other than the bad service and disappointing food, is that the ambience is actually quite nice with the natural light streaming in from IFC\'s glass roof and high ceilingsSurprisingly uncrowded for a weekend lunch, which suggests that I\'m not the only (or first) one to find the experience disappointing!'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-panino-giusto/151120?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

Good price, good food! Thumbs up!!!Keep it up guys.... I will definitely be back!"", '0Xiao long bao you say? Causeway Bay you say? Surely that means (yet) another visit to Din Tai Fung? On any week night you would be correct, dashing from work straight to the MTR for the short ride out for soup dumpling goodness. However this time it was the weekend, and we were at the other side of Causeway Bay, wandering Times Square and Lee Gardens, and didn\'t fancy trying to mimic salmon swimming upstream against the hordes of people heading to the shops. We had been wandering around Lee Gardens, enjoying a spot of window shopping, when we spied a sign for Paradise Dynasty, with the multi-coloured xiao long bao pictured. Intrigued by the colours, we decided to try our luck at getting a table, thinking lunchtime around Causeway Bay would be a nightmare. Walking out of the lift we were struck by the large foyer area filled with tables, however we did not have to worry about waiting, as at that time of the day it seemed we had avoided the queues. We also noticed the restaurant\'s sign ""Paradise Dynasty: Legend of Xiao Long Bao"". Hmmm, sounded like something out of a very tasty movie! Paradise Gardens is part of the Paradise Group, originally from Singapore, with restaurants in Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, mainland China, Japan and now Hong Kong. It certainly had a slick feel of a large operation, however I must admit after a long morning of window shopping it was good to be off my feet and to know that lunch should be relatively stress free. We were quickly ushered to our table and provided with the customary tea while we perused the menu. While I say this should have been a relatively stress-free lunch, there was a tense moment when we had to decide which xiao long bao to get - FMUS wanted to try the signature 8 flavoured xiao long bao, however I was feeling less adventurous, thinking that I would end up having to eat the flavours that neither of us wanted. So we compromised - one serve of the original flavour, and one of the foie gras flavour. The good thing about the ordering system at Paradise Garden was that you could actually order one of two sizes - 6 pieces or 10 pieces. That suited FMUS perfectly, and you can guess which size of the original we ordered.....First to arrive was the foie gras xiao long bao. When ordering foie gras, you tend to expect a richness of flavour, and these xiao long bao didn\'t disappoint. Very creamy foie gras filled the dumplings, but I\'m glad we only ordered six, they were indeed really rich. 0The original xiao long bao were served next, and while they didn\'t have the exact precision you can find at Din Tai Fung, they were delicious, and a worthy competitor to our usual haunt. Had we not ordered some other dishes, I could see that FMUS would have wanted to order two rounds of the 10 dumplings. 0We had decided to try something other than just xiao long bao this lunch. Sticking with the less adventurous theme however, we had ordered the sweet and sour chicken, which I thought was a great example of this traditional Chinese dish (but did think I wish I had ordered some rice to mop up the sauce). FMUS was not so enamoured, not being a fan of the capsicum on the dish, but he did agree the sauce had that great combination of sweetness with a hint of sour. 0His favourite dish (apart from the xiao long bao of course!) was the Shanghai style braised pork belly. Talk about melt in your mouth!! The pork was extremely soft and juicy, and the sauce...wow, tasty! There was a sweetness to it like a plum sauce, but it managed to complemented the pork well, which itself had a large amount of its own sweetness, from the well rendered fat. I\'m not a huge fan of a lot of pork, so left FMUS to finish off the dish, but I have to admit, that sauce was amazing. FMUS almost had a Mr Creosote moment, he wanted to finish off the pork and the yummy sauce, but there was just no more room in his stomach! 0We have often walked past signs in shopping centres and on the street indicating restaurants upstairs, however we are generally put off by the large queues waiting at the lifts. This time were were half way up the building already, so avoided the ground floor wait, and I\'m glad we decided to try somewhere new for FMUS\'s xiao long bao fix. While the service was a little impersonal, as was to be expected in a busy restaurant, it was efficient and we didn\'t feel like we were being overlooked. I would definitely go back, and this time I would try the 8 flavours of xiao long bao - to see if they really do live up to the legend...0Sauces and tea, ready to go0The foie gras xiao long bao, very decadent 0The original xiao long bao0Probably should have ordered some rice to mop up the delicious sauces0Cool Chinese suit of armour 0Plenty of lunch time diners, and the open kitchen0Its cool watching the kitchen at work0', ""We came here for the Groupon tea set and had a fairly decent experience.The atmosphere of the restaurant is good.

The gourd was not too bitter and the chili played nicely against the cold vegetable. Not bad.Next came Shanghai rice cakes with pork and vegetables. These were OK. Basically, they are filler.

The texture of all of the XLB was good and it is a nice twist on the classic, but in all honesy, the original one is the best.The flavours are: Original (good), Cheesy (undetectable cheese), Szechuan (good, but not Szechuanese flavoured!), Garlic (good - nice strong flavour), Ginseng (weird), Crab Roe (OK - strong crabby taste), Black Truffle (good, but not obvious truffliness), Foie Gras (porky, not livery - OK).You can't mess with a classic and the original was the best. I would return to eat a steamer full of originals. The skin on the XLB was good. strong, but thin and soft. Lastly came the fried pumpkin puffs. They were really nice. Like little chewy doughnuts. A nice way to round out the meal.All in all, PD is a good option for some higher end XLB. I would go again, but not in a huge hurry.

Luckily, shortly after approaching the 2nd staff, the noodles arrived. However, we were still waiting for the fried rice, which was why we approached the 3rd staff and eventually the manager who checked it and informed us that they had forgotten about the rice and that he would waive it for us. Ha, after all the waiting. None of the staff were apologetic in any way, which pissed us off. Right when we were about to leave after paying the bill, the fried rice arrived......and the manager told us that whether we wanted it or not, he would leave it on the table for us.

Maybe it happened because the restaurant is rather new."", 'It is hard to miss Paradise Dynasty\'s arrival in Hong Kong, what with posters of its signature colourful xiaolongbao plastered everywhere. They were giving out fans depicting a basket of xiaolongbao outside Lee Theatre this afternoon, a clever marketing material that would-be customers is bound to gratefully receive in this weather. What\'s more, the xiaolongbao looked enticingly plump and delectable in the picture, and the fan entitled customers to a free basket of 8 assorted xiaolongbao (88 HKD) upon the purchase of one basket. SOLD.Like Din Tai Feng and Crystal Jade, Paradise Dynasty has favoured transparency in the process of xiaolongbao-making. Normally I\'d find it entertaining if the kitchen can actually be seen from outside the restaurant, especially if I were to be waiting in line for a table. However one would only see this upon entering the restaurant itself. Food beckoned. I did not linger.Xiaolongbao factory0Xiaolongbao factoryOur table of three ordered a few items to share:Dan dan mian (48 HKD)Dan dan mian0Dan dan mianMy Hong Kong colleagues exclaimed that it was way too spicy. I have Singaporean tastebuds, so the level of spice did not daunt me.The soup was a tad oily and too thin.As expected, it did not taste very much of peanut. It just didn\'t have the right consistency that would give it the intense nutty flavour that I expect my dan dan mian to have.It came with an insignificant sprinkling of peanuts and minced meat, both of which were superfluous.Xiaolongbao (88 HKD per basket of 8 assorted xiaolongbaos)Signature assorted xiaolongbao - I\'d recommend it once to get it out of your system...0Signature assorted xiaolongbao - I\'d recommend it once to get it out of your system...The xiaolongbao arrived shortly, just in time to potentially redeem its dan dan mian compatriot. The jewel coloured dumplings looked glorious. Flavours from the top, clockwise were black truffle, cheese, crab roe, garlic, Szechuan, ginseng and foie gras. The white one in the middle was the original flavour.The original. I was keen to see how it stacked up against the competition. The skin was thin and springy, and it had an adequate amount of flavourful broth within. The pork filling was savoury and complemented very well with a slight dipping in vinegar.The black truffle. It tasted more like dried Chinese mushrooms. Perhaps they might have marketed it as such and I wouldn\'t have been disappointed. There wasn\'t a truffle aroma as one would expect from a dish that contains truffle.The Szechuan. This had bits of peppercorn in it and was pleasantly aromatic and mildly numbing. The meaty broth within was imbued with numbing spiciness, reminiscent of my favourite Chongqing noodle broth. This was my favourite of the lot.The foie gras. Tasted like pork liver. I don\'t think foie gras should be wasted chopped up and mixed in a xiaolongbao filling. It doesn\'t do the foie gras justice, and it doesn\'t add anything to the xiaolongbao experience.The crab roe. Disappointing. I couldn\'t tell what flavour it was by looking at the filling (no orange crab roe evident), or tasting the broth. I could only tell it was meant to be the crab roe upon biting into it and was overwhelmed by fishiness (by the process of elimination - none of the other xiaolongbaos were meant to be fishy!)I didn\'t try the rest but my colleagues mentioned that the ginseng xiaolongbao tasted of ginseng. I was warned to avoid the cheese. I don\'t like garlic in a steamed context, so kindly let the others have it. Lettuce rolls (48 HKD)Lettuce rolls1Lettuce rollsThe lettuce greens were bounded a tad sloppily with zucchini so tended to come apart when dipped in the accompanying sesame sauce. They were refreshing and crunchy. But sides like these do not redeem a meal.Guo tie / pan fried dumplings (32 HKD)0These came in a weird shape and my colleagues asked me if they were ""Singapore-shaped"". I assured them that these were just poorly shaped and therefore poorly fried. Obviously the colour of the three dumplings were inconsistent. The oiliness of the skin was evident. The skin was too thick. This was a fail.Egg souffle with sweet red bean pasteEgg souffle with sweet red bean paste1Egg souffle with sweet red bean pasteI thought this was again way too oily, and the egg white was weighed down by the oil. My colleagues enjoyed these though.The restaurant is cavernous and dimly lit, which gave it a cool, dark vibe that is common in these modern Chinese cuisine places these days. While the place was fairly packed during lunch, it was less noisy and chaotic than your average dim sum restaurant. Service staff tended to be pretty clueless on product offerings that were not on the order form (specifically, the desserts). They were also confused with our orders and had to check back three times. But I guess those are teething problems.I think they\'d have to improve the quality of their food for me to want to come again. If not for their funky xiaolongbao flavours, which I honestly wouldn\'t crave as much as a properly made traditional xiaolong bao, one is better off at their nearest competitor in CWB, Din Tai Feng, which does everything else consistently well.'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-paradise-dynasty/170063?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw
535,Pasta Mio,Central,Italian,2.1,50.3,3.0,"Two of us wanted to have a quick casual pasta for lunch. There was no one at the counter at first. We waited about 1 or 2 minutes before anyone showed up. Even though it was a dine in option, the pasta still came in take away boxes and disposable wear. We wouldn't expect more from what seems to be a fast food joint but the food was something to be remembered. The pesto sauce was about 75% made of parmesan and apart from a few greenish herbs, the remainder was oil (about 1 inch deep). The arrabiata sauce was even more peculiar. We are huge fans of spicy food, frequenting Thai, Sichuanese, Korean restaurants on a regular basis. But this sauce was beyond fiery and we had to regrettably toss it out. Disastrous pretty much sums it up."", ""I ordered the chicken, tomato, rosemary pasta with wholemeal pasta and it was not a pleasant experience.  The pasta was the roughest wholemeal pasta I've had.  I know wholemeal pasta is not as smooth as normal pasta, but this one was dotted with visible bits of fibre with a rough mouth-feel.  The sauce had bits of plant fibre in it which had to be picked out as they were not edible (not sure what it was, it looked like the stalk of something).  There was very little chicken, diced into tiny cubes. A big chunk of pasta was stuck together and, as a result, raw.  I stuck a fork in it and could lift up the bottom layer of the box. That was my first and only time.  I might consider giving them a second chance to see if it's a one off bad experience, but I would definitely not order the chicken, or the wholemeal pasta"", ""Back when I was a kid, my knowledge of pasta was limited to spaghetti, alphabets and Campbell soup   But it was a treat at the time.Then in the dormitory days, started to come across cheese macaroni, spaghettini, fettucine, canneloni and my favourite lasagna As the italian cuisine started to take a foothold in the local gourmet industry in recent years, more and more varieties of pasta were introduced into HK.First came ravioli, angel hair, fussili, inguini, penne followed by lots of other varieties -- short pastas like gnocchi and orecchiette; long pastas like farfelle and pappardelle; and stuffed pastas like tortellini ....However, a lot of these pastas were available mainly in specialty italian groceries or in higher end italian restaurants. And to be honest, I have only heard of the names of many, like gnocchi, orecchiette and tortellini, but hadvenever tried them.That was the scene until Pasta Mio came into the picture.Tucked under the mid-levels escalator at Cochrane St, Pasta Mio operates much like a fast food store specializing in pastas.  Fast, made-to-order and ready-to-go were the main features of the shop.  It also has a few seats, probably less than 10, outside the store but with a shade to protect customers from the sun.  Outdoor seats under the shade0Outdoor seats under the shadeThe place offers 10 different types of pastas and 10 different sauces.  The sauce was really different combinations of tomato, cream, cheese, mushrooms, herbs and cold cuts.  But the choice of pasta and sauce add up to a great combination of meals, perhaps only limited by one's imagination.  The combination of pastas and sauce0The combination of pastas and sauceYou select the pasta first, then the sauce, then the texture/consistency especially if you prefer tender rather than al dente pasta, followed by the size and any add-ons (extra cheese etc).The food is ready in 10 minutes after order.Pasta made to order on the spot0Pasta made to order on the spotDifferent pastas ready to-go0Different pastas ready to-goWe ordered:Tortellini in Pomodoro sauce (tomato & basil) 0Tortellini in Pomodoro sauce (tomato & basil)  This is my first bite of tortellini.  The tortellini has a spinach and cheese filling and a lot smaller than raviolis.  The sauce was light and refreshing, topped by a layer of parmesan cheese.  The serving was really generous.  Ours is a regular size order and it must have over 10 tortellinis.Fusilli in Boscaiola  0Fusilli in Boscaiola  The sauce is made of tomato, cream, ham and mushrooms.  The fusilli was al dente and the serving was generous.  However, the sauce was bit short and could barely coat the fusilli.  Again, the pasta was topped with a layer of parmesan that made the whole meal a lot tastier.Gnocchi in Amatriciana0Gnocchi in AmatricianaThe sauce is tomato and bacon.  Again the sauce was short.  This is my first time trying gnocchi.  Honestly, I found it a bit too chewy.  Heard that the pasta was made from a mix of flour and potato.  So it was very filling to the stomach but personally, I'd prefer the more traditional al dente pasta.Thanks to Groupon, the meal was only $33 a piece (regular price $66).  The presentation of the food was not quite appealing, and tastewise, was just above average.  However, at $33, it was a good deal for a quick italian meal.  For the ladies, they also serve fit-size pastas at a lower price.  In fact, at $29 you can have a fit-size pasta of the day which I think is a super deal.  $29 fit-size pasta of the day0$29 fit-size pasta of the dayBravo, Pasta mama mia, italiano.

And it wasn't like my food was left out in the cold. Plus, I knew how good it was, so I was willing to wait 10 minutes or so.

Nothing hugely noteworthy, but they tasted good enough and we enjoyed them.The dan dan noodles came out next and we were unpleasantly surprised by them. They were of the Taiwan/Hong Kong style with a peanut sauce rather than the traditional spicy Sichuan style (like you get in the fabulous Yu in Causeway bay - so good). If it were simply a peanut based noodle dish, we would have been happy, but unfortunately it was super shrimpy. It was more of a laksa than a dan dan and, quite frankly, tasted foul.

It was also a nice novelty to eat off a sizzling plate and mix everything together with the sauces in a vain effort to look like you actually made it yourself and have an ounce of culinary talent.I have found more recently, this place has declined in quality, due to:-The beef is sparse and more fat than meat-Portion sizes are smaller, but prices are higher-The wait time is really long-Less flavour in the food, which is probably from churning out the dishes as fast as they canI hope it gets better and back to how it was but for now I wouldn't bother going hereFINAL VERDICT:WAS A HIT, NOW A MISS"", ""Went here for lunch with a friend as it is easy to find and I knew that it had good food.

Without hesitation, I took the two tall stools at the bar and in split second those at al fresco were occupied.Surprisingly, quite a number of seats were available after 1315 hrs. Not sure if it is a norm.Anyway, the lunch menu is simple and clear. $148 for starters + Pasta + Dolci. We took Beef Tartare, Radiccho salad as starters, Pappardelle & Plin ravioli as pasta and one tiramisu as dolci (you can choose expresso as alternative). They also serve bread at the start.At the bar, you can observe the young lady making the pasta with the machine. A good showmanship to demonstrate that their pasta is fresh daily.The restaurant is quite stylish and has its character. I checked the outlook of their other two restaurants in Wanchai and Tsim Sha Tsui and they are of similar style. However, may be it is a bit packed, it is quite noisy and soft voices as we both are, it's good opportunity to practice raising our voices.The portions of starters were above expectation. As for pasta, the Ravioli had six pieces and the portion of Pappardella was a bit smaller. However, the sauces of the two dishes blended well with the pasta.The Tiramisu is large, served in a large glass. It was quite sweet and really it is not authentic Italian style Tiramisu.Pricewise, it was quite standard in Central area.

We ordered a tagliatelle with mussels and saffron cream and a tagliolini with black truffle on top, both pasta are delicious but they are a bit salty to me. 00To conclude, Pici serves one of the best pasta in town and the environment is so relax and chill, highly recommend you to come if you are looking for a place for decent food and great vibes.l', 'Pici offerred exceptional tasty hand made pasta that I have ever eaten in Hong Kong.

I would say it would be a pretty good deal for dinner.Previous Openrice review indicated that no phone reservation for table was offered, and the table arrangement and waiter service were not well organzied.

543,Pici,Wan Chai,Italian,4.3,185.5,8.0,"Its quite far from my workplace. I was all sweaty when I arrived at the restaurant in a hot day! But its all worth and Ill comeback sometime. Its a cozily decorated Italian restaurant, nothing too fancy just like a home. Tables are a small but ok for us to enjoy a happy lunch. There are basically only pastas on the menu with starters and desserts (two choices only). This was a good sign that Il would get to try what the restaurant was good at. A lunch set costed hkd148 including a starter, a pasta and a dessert or coffee. Pastas were basically same as those on the a la carte menu but of a bundle price. Hkd148 was a good price already. However i thought I I found a better offer on the a la carte menu, the tasting menu which was hkd290. The waitress introduced the tasting menu included two starters, 3 pastas and 2 desserts. Well at that moment, I thought its a much better choice than the lunch set, I calculated in my mind, 148 x 2 > 290. So we ordered the tasting menu. We only found that it was hkd290 per person. Anyway, it was not too bad. We ordered a salad and a cold cut as starters. And then a lasagna, a smoked salmon ravioli and a truffle spaghetti. The salmon ravioli felt lighter that I thought. Not much source or cream, a bit cheese and smoked salmon in the ravioli inside and a few cherry tomatoes on the side. We agreed the smoked salmon stood out and the tomatoes made the dishes a bit more refreshing than ordinary ravioli. The lasagna came after the ravioli. Apparent to me that the dish was freshly basked with a thick layer of melted cheese on the top. Tasty that the sourness of the tomato sauce stood out. The truffle spaghetti came last. At this price the amount of sliced truffle was really big. Of coz I have no idea the price range of different grades of truffle. Anyway, the smell of truffle was very strong. Those truffle lover may love that but I was not a truffle lover from the beginnings. The taste was good. All the pasta were of a rather soft type, instead of being al dente that people always mentioned. They tasted like homemade. I quite liked that. Pasta is a homey food. I love the simple way that pici offers. And my stomach was satisfied. At last I chose the tiramisu which was served in a glass. It was so creamy with an appropriate amount of coffee. It didnt look fantastic but was one of the best tiramisu Ive had. 10Smoked salmon ravioli0Smoked salmon ravioliLasagna 0Lasagna 0Truffle spaghetti 0Truffle spaghetti', ""This place has been on my to-go list for ages and finally had the time to visit today.Arrived at around 12noon and man it was packed already!No wonder some said they have to wait quite a while.Greeted by the friendly staff, we were seated in front of the bar table,you can see drinks being made and parma ham being sliced in front of you.3Lunch menu included a starters, a pasta and dessert which costs only $148!What a good bargin0A small bag of bread was also being served with olive oil and vinegarNot sure if you can ask for a re-fill?Starters0StartersWe ordered Beef tongue and Andrea's Cold cuts as startersThey look so delicious, don't they?Andrea's Cold Cuts0Andrea's Cold CutsThis platter has plenty of nicely sliced parma ham and two huge chucks of Parmesan cheese.I saved the cheese for the pasta later but the ham was good.I had mine with the bread as it can get quite salty if you eat it on its own.Beef Tongue0Beef TongueThe beef tongue has a lovely presentation!The green sauce adds a bit of freshness to the dish,not sure what the deep fried 'sticks' are in the middlebut they add a nice crunchThe beef tongue was sliced very very thinly,so you can't really get the rich flavor which was a pityBut overall the starters were very goodPasta0PastaAs the pasta was being cooked once you've placed your order,you may have to wait a bit longer during peak hourbut the waiter was very caring and came to tell us ours would be served very soon after seeing us waiting for a while.Gnocchi0GnocchiWhen I see Gnocchi on the menu, I order it.You can't get this type of pasta easily in Hong Kong (which is a shame),not to mention a decent one,Pici did not disappoint!The gnocchi was chewy and wrapped in a rich and creamy sauceIt was such a lovely dish I did not want to share it at allHappy to finish the whole plate myself to be honestA must try item if you ask me!Tagliatelle Di Mare0Tagliatelle Di MareMy friend wanted to try this seafood pastaand again, Pici didn't disappoint.The tomato sauce has a hint of spiciness which adds a nice kick to this dishand makes it less plain and boringThe mussels, scallop and octopus was very nice and not overcookedYou get overcooked octopus all the time when dining out,so glad to have non-chewing gum style octopus today.The pasta was the right al-denteand I really fall in love with freshly made pasta after thisI need to learn how to make pasta soon!Or simply visit this place on a regular basisPanna Cotta0Panna CottaEven though we were quite full already,how can we miss the famous dessert!We ordered a panna cotta and a tiramisuand I do think the tiramisu wins todayThe panna cotta is smooth and creamyand the berry sauce on top adds some sweetness to itDon't get me wrong, this is nice but the tiramisu was better lolTiramisu0TiramisuJust look at the creamy and rich tiramisu hereMan I want one now!It was so smooth and richwith a layer of lady fingers soaked in espressoThe bitterness from the coffee and the richness from the cheese mixturethis is the dessert to die forTiramisu0TiramisuMUST TRY ITEM!Overall we had a lovely experience at Pici today with very good food and friendly staffDefinitely will recommend this place to those who's looking for good dining out experienceJust don' come during rush hour hahaWill come back for dinner next time and try out other pasta!"", 'A $148 lunch set, which includes a starter, pasta and dessert, may not sound very attractive to you.

My toddler son loves pasta so we decided to try for Saturday lunch. When we got there, the ground floor was almost full and the receptionist took us to the 1st floor. Other than our table, only one other table was occupied. We ordered and shortly after that the resturant was packed. Order starters because you will need them! Our pasta took a while to arrive and when it did, it wasn't a huge portion. To me, that's not a problem at all. The 2 men seated next to our table asked if they could order an additional dish but the server told them that they couldn't because the padta were sold out. We ordered burrata as our appetiser. It was delicious! My husband is not a fan of rocket or cherry tomatoes but the three really worked well together. The first pasta that came was the tagliolini with shallot, white truffle paste and fresh shaved black truffle. Next was the garganelli with the porcini mushroom. I asked for cream based pasta for my son because he will not eat anything with red sauce. They said they can make him short pasta and this is what they served. My son loved it and ate all the pasta! My husband and I ate all the mushroom and they are the best mushroom on a pasta dish that I've ever tasted. My order which was the pasta of the day, Raviolini with runny egg yolk inside came last. Unfortunately, I was 3/4 done with one of them and didn't find any egg yolk. I asked where the egg was and I was able to return my plate and the restaurant manager came up a few minutes later to apologise and to tell me that they're making the pasta for me. Niko, the manager, had a conversation with my son and told him he'd have a surprise if he finished all his pasta! :-) and true enough, he received his first Kinder egg. About 10 minutes later after Niko has gone back down, my pasta arrived. It looked the same but when I cut into it, the yolk flowed and I was in heaven. I love my egg yolks for breakfast so I am very pleased with my pasta. It had butter, parmesan and hazelnuts! For dessert we ordered Tiramisu. It was good but I didn't like the sugar that I was tasting. I thought it was a bit too sweet for me but my husband liked it. We got the bill and decided we'll be coming back soon to try their other pasta, their meatballs and pana cotta. Overall, it was worth the price and the wait (for the pasta to arrive).

The fresh pasta has a beautifully silky yet springy texture and a rich, almost buttery egg-yolk flavour. With its wide strands, the pappardelle lends itself extremely well to the rich duck rag and the sauces.

I will comeback again for this dish. Iced coffee was cold enough and the restaurant is half full now. I asked for my bill and it takes around 2 minutes waits for my bill. I think there is not enough servers in this restaurant. Overall, I am satisfied with the food and drink, I will come back still.

547,PizzaExpress,Causeway Bay,Italian,2.1,150.0,0.0,"Went there yesterday again with my family. And it reminded me why we haven't been there in over a month since they changed their menu. We ordered Caesar salad, Margarita Pizza spaghetti bolognese with meatballs, ceciti (not sure of this spelling) the Parmesan with mushroom, and the calamari. I would say that all were disappointing and unrefined except for the parmesan with mushroom. The Caesar salad seems to be just lettuce with some sauce and poorly chopped bacon (unlike before, there weren't even any anchovies) the pizza was thin and tasteless, the spaghetti with meatballs was not like what they had before and seems like something from Spaghetti House and the calamari was soggy and tasteless. Maybe this has something to do with their change in management and / or their menu change. Totally disappointed as we've been going to this restaurant for years.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-pizzaexpress/142049?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
548,PizzaExpress,Central,Italian,3.4,149.5,0.0,"I was feeling lazy and decided to order pizza. My pizza standard in general is quite high, but i\'ve learned that in Hong Kong it really shouldn\'t be. Recently I have been disappointed by Jacomax and Piccolo, so I decided to give Pizza Express a try. Overall, it\'s pretty good, and I think I might actually order again someday.Price and portion: i did not feel ripped off. I ordered the ""Special Set"" ($333) which includes ""2x pizza or pasta, 1x garlic bread with parmesan and gorgonzola, 1x dough balls with nutella."" that is a lot of food, in my opinion, for the money, and my intention was always to keep the leftovers for the next day. One thing though is that in the special set there is no salad, which I would have preferred to, say, the nutella dough balls (i just don\'t like sweet/dessert things in general). Some green stuff would have been nice.Taste: not bad, not bad. the ""garlic bread"" was nice. the dough was extremely fluffy and the gorgonzola was pungent as it should be. My only gripe is that I really couldn\'t taste any garlic---just gorgonzola. also, these guys i guess because of how fluffy the dough is don\'t make great leftovers, as they get stale pretty quick.0the lasagna actually had a decent taste. i didn\'t really appreciate the obviously burnt top, but that didn\'t affect the flavor much anyway. the bolognese and bechamel sauces in the lasagna were surprisingly good though. also, it makes great leftovers.now for the pizza: we got the classic margherita pizza, and it was pretty good. the nicest surprise was the sauce, which tasted like a properly made tomato sauce, even if the texture was slightly too smooth. the crust though was underwhelming. i\'m really picky about pizza crust. pizza is supposed to be cooked in an insanely hot oven on an insanely hot surface that leaves the crust on the bottom crispy and nearly burnt while the cheese on top melts and the tomato sauce roasts. this strikes me as pizza that was not cooked in an optimally hot oven, and so the crust was kind of soft for my tastes. meh.also, i ordered one topping, the spicy red peppers. don\'t do that. they put barely any peppers on top and the topping costs $18. the pizza is fine by itself.the nutella dough balls were good, though i\'m not sure how they could actually be messed up.overall i think this place is pretty good and we will likely order again the next time we are feeling lazy.000', 'I cane here at lunch time in central to grab a bit to eat. We were seated quickly (once we had gone up in the lift to the second floor) and had ordered quickly too, as the floor was quite small so the waiters could easily see when we wanted to order. The atmosphere was nice as it was less busy and not too loud. I had an Alba pizza and my friend had lasagne- it looked creamy and she said that it tasted very nice and was very filling. My pizza was fresh and hot too, and they both came quite quickly- about 10 or 15mins after ordering- especially considering it was central lunch time rush hour! My pizza was nice and crispy, and the flavours were just right. It was not too oily which was nice, but I would have preferred if the mozarella on it was not just placed in small lumps on the pizza but maybe spread out a bit more so the flavour was more balanced instead of just biting into a bit of mozzarella. But apart from that it was great- they also had little wet wipes so that you could clean your fingers after eating your pizza which was useful! Overall great lunch, but quite expensive as my pizza was $139- but worth it.

It was quite rare in Wanchai.0Since today is Monday, I selected vegetarian meals, and theywere:(1) Bruschetta Italia - OK2 pieces were served. The bruschetta was topped with tomato sauce, half-cut cherry tomatoes and basil leave. The bruschetta was crispy but the taste was plain. 0(2) Giardiniera, which was served with a bowl of green salad - OKThe pizza was medium in size, and was cut in three pieces. It was topped with mushrooms, basil sauce, pepper etc. The taste was plain as well.0(3) A glass of raspberry cooler - OKNot sweet, quite cool. OK. Nothing special.0I would say the taste of the food was plain and was not outstanding, and the food portion was small. That may explain why there were still many emptytables there. The total price, with the 10% service charge, was $108.9. I will definitely not visit there again for this price level.', 'Read in the papers that Pizza Express was featuring Burrata in its July menu, and came specifically for it. 0Burrata is a kind of Italian fresh cheese similar to mozzarella. Its outside is actually mozzarella but with a creamy center made of cream and mozzarella (source: Wikjipedia), so it is softer and creamier than usual mozzarella. Pizza Express boasts burrata bing flown in from Apulia in southern Italy where the cheese originates. I ordered a Fusilli al Pomodoro e Burrata (Fusilli, slow cooked tomato sauce, basil, finished with torn Burrata) ($109 +10%) to try. Yeah the pasta looked spectacular:0(The Parmesan shaves were offered separately for addition at will.)All shades of red, green and white made the dish really appetising. Unfortunately the fusilli was a bit undercooked rather than al dente (should be fine if boiled for some 30 seconds to 1 minute more?), nevertheless the flavor of the tomato sauce was mild and not too ""ketchup-y"", with a delightful fragrance of basil, complete with sweet halves of cherry tomatoes. The portion was generous too, and so I didn\'t have space for dessert afterward. As for the burrata, well...I can\'t say it was ""creamy"" as it had been torn up already and any cream that should have been oozing out would have gone by this mere act. Probably if I had gone for a Burrata Tricolore (a whole burrata served with tomatos), cut that up on the spot I\'d have seen the cream. I had to use some imagination in order to ""generate"" that ""creaminess"", yet it was still milkier and softer than the springy supermarket-grade mozzarella that I used at home some weeks ago. Close up of the Burrata0Close up of the BurrataDespite the slight let-down about the food, I like the bright, cheerful ambience of the joint, and the friendly manageress and her team made up for what might be an average experience here. 0The Burrata menu @ Pizza Express is supposed to be for July only, so try your luck before it\'s too late.', ""I've always been a big fan of Pizza Express. I'm never disappointed by their food and desserts, and always come out with a full stomach. On this particularly day, I was adventrous and tried their new items (pizza etna) and penne with chicken marsala. Although they are not the best I've had, i wouldn't complain at all However, I notice this store is very busy with takeaway orders. As I was seated fairly close to the open kitchen, I couldn't help but notice the cooks are jamming out lots of dishes in paper boxes, and only occasionally would a dine-in plate come out. We waited about 25 mins to get our main course... by the we were already half dead from hunger. This is my 3rd visit to this particular store and we always have to wait long time to get our food. Occasionally we go to another Pizza Express in Wan Chai, and we had never been treated this way in another store. Also, I kinda wish the cooks would realize that they work in an open kitchen, and would keep their chattering to minimal or low volume."", 'A group of us came here for a work lunch, and luckily we had reservations, since the restaurant was completely full during peak lunch hours. I didn\'t get to take any pictures of the food, but they did look very palatable.Between four people, we ordered the following to share:  Baked  Dough Balls ($49)I never thought they were great from previous visits where it came on the side of salads, but this time it arrived hot, toasty and with three condiments - butter (not garlic butter, as said on the menu), pesto genovese and pesto rosso.Whilst pesto genovese is your standard basil-salt-garlic-olive oil mix, the pesto rosso is a red pesto made with puree of sundried tomatoes, herbs and olive oil. Both the pesto sauces were very good - just enough salt and very flavourful. 7/10Antipasto ($89)The antipasto was a platter with salami (sausage), prosciutto (dry-cured ham, same as parma ham), mortadella (sliced Italian cured sausage), coppa (dry-cured pork neck/shoulder), rocket and a couple of marinated sun-dried tomatoes and sweet peppers.  Good variety, and although I didn\'t try the salami (too salty, never liked it), the other selections were fresh, tasty and the whole plate was really colourful. 7/10Nostrana Salad ($106)I would\'ve gone for caesar but I wasn\'t doing the ordering. This had potatoes, sliced chicken, green beans, avocado, chopped boiled egg and dressed in a creamy white dressing (\'signature dressing""). The dressing was really good - nothing too rich as just enough was given and nothing too salty etc., salad would be better without the potatoes + avocado and more mesclun mix for me! =P  6.5/10Parma Pizza (Changed from Neapolitan to Roman base) ($131)I\'ve never had \'roman\' base here before - turns out it was a really thin crispy base that was honestly really good! The toppings included dollops of ricotta cheese, generous amount of prosciutto and hint of rosemary on a tomato pizza sauce base, and has no mozzarella but parmesan instead. The last time I went to Pizza Express I tried the Salmon Leggera (real bad) at Soho and before that, a Trifolata (mushroom) on Neapolitan pizza base at Ashley Rd which was cold and lacked any toppings. Although this Roman pizza was smaller than the average Neapolitan size (think it was about 12-inches?), the abundance of toppings and crust made me forget any minor issues. 8.5/10Mushroom Pasta (aka Fusilli al Funghi) ($105)This never made it to our table since they messed up our orders (they served us a pizza and pasta dish which belonged to the table next to us, but didn\'t put this down when we ordered)Iced Lemon Tea each ($35)unlimited refill (if people ever drink so much in one sitting which is a good deal, but I wanted to mention this because it didn\'t taste like your standard Ceylon Tea...it was much better and unique! I am still wondering what tea it was. Star Street\'s Pizza Express doesn\'t do lunch sets, which I think they should - multi-courses and smaller portions of dishes from their a la carte menu so tables for two may enjoy their own choices rather than resorting to share. The prices could also be a tad lower, after all the servings were all pretty small to justify its price. Service this lunch was also rather slow - ratio of diners: cooks/waitresses was not very balanced, and they kept messing things up...Nonetheless, way better food than Ashley rd + Soho branches!', 'Read about their new line ""Leggera"", or ""light"" in Italian, offering choices for the calorie-consicous. Especially notable are the pizzas, which are shaped like a donut, with salad greens replacing the dough, together with lower-fat toppings, using fior di latte mozzarella, and all pizzas are about 500 calories, whole. Went to this branch as Wing Fung St. outlet was fully booked.Ordered the following:1. Parma with neapolitan crust $130A single bite is a party in your mouth, with salty proscuitto ham, generous parmesan shavings, smooth pomodoro sauce and creamy warm ricotta. I love how the cheese is separate, not smothered, on the pizza base, so you can enjoy the distinct tastes of every ingredient.2.  Spaghetti Frutta di Mare ($105)With mussels, venus clams, calamari and tiger shrimp. I enjoyed the sauce the most, which is sauteed with some onions and cilantro, and garnished with basil. The mild hint of olive oil gives it a richer body.3. Quattro Fromaggi with Roman crust ($115)The 4 cheeses used in Pizza Express\' recipe: Gorgonzola stands out from the rest, gouda gives it a deep lavor, emmental contributes to the texture, and mozzarella is like giving your taste buds a break from all the synergy! A bit rich perhaps, but a delight for cheese lovers. Topped with a single pitted olive in the middle.4. Al Tonno Leggera ($1xx)I initially ordered a Vitabella, but they made this instead - with sauteed spinach and tuna. I like its feta cheese pairing. The fior di latte mozzarella has a high-moisture content so it was quite creamy; flavor was not compromised! I would have still prefered my order, with more vegetable toppings. The greens in the middle consist of baby spinach, arugula, santos tomato which were fresh; I really liked the balsamic vinegar based dressing which was thick and  very sweet, but they could have used less - it sort of soaked into the pizza. Service is better than many restaurants; staff are friendly, helpful; refill of drinks and water is fast. This branch may be a bit cramped though, seating is not the most comfortable, but dining area is well-lit and spotless. A great place for parties large or small, kid-friendly as well. Definitely worth a visit, and you\'re likely to come back.Parma (classic pizza)0Parma (classic pizza)Spaghetti Frutta di Mare0Spaghetti Frutta di MareQuattro Fromaggi0Quattro FromaggiLeggera: Al Tonno0Leggera: Al Tonno'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/wan-chai-pizzaexpress/22271?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

And now they have opened in Causeway Bay's Fashion Walk area. Which is great for me as it's now closer to where I live!0The restaurant is larger in size than their Central branch. There is both indoor and outdoor seating. Menu has also expanded. Along with their usual poke bowl of choosing two items,, they now have more choices. You can now create your own or have a pre-designed bowl of poke. They also have musubis for those that love spam with nori and BBQ platters f or group sharing. Menu is in English only. And now they have added 10% service charge for dining in.0As I wasn't too interested in the poke choices that day, I chose a pre-designed bowl. This is the Shakalaka ($98). This has green onions, cucumbers, purple cabbage, diced onions, inamona, tuna and avocado. I chose half and half of brown rice and salad and topped with a creamy dressing.

I have always liked the Graham branch and made occasional visits to the Wanchai one (which is now closed) so seeing one in the CWB neighborhood excited me.  The ambience is somewhat different with stronger Hawaiian touch I would say, and they also setup a couple dine-in seatings. I tried to order my all time favorite poke bowl but unfortunately the creamy tofu was sold out - I think they need to make better estimation as I see a lot of stuff were nearly out and didnt look too appetizing (but they still do actually). The poke bowl didnt disappoint and remained the best and authentic poke in town.One little setback though was that one supervisor was educating her staff at the counter while I was enjoying my poke. I pretty much witnessed the entire scenario and I thought it could be done backstage and in a more subtle way. There are bits and pieces to be improved in general but I am glad they are back and I would be back for more.

When I arrived, I was very uncertain as to what I should order but I was surprised and flattered by the sincere service and help the employees had to offer as they gladly allowed me to try a few pieces of poke so that I could make my decision. In addition, before handing me and my friend the pieces of tuna, she asked if we had any allergies which was very considerate and rare in most Hong Kong restaurants. Eventually, I decided to go with a half and half base with their limu poke and wasabi mayo poke. The limu poke was slightly weaker in flavour compared to the wasabi mayo poke considering the mixture included shoyu and ginger. However, in compensation the slightly crunchy seaweed enhanced the overall texture of the dish. On the other hand, I loved the wasabi mayo poke with just the right amount of heat to stimulate my appetite and within minutes I had finished the bowl and was craving more.Overall, Pololi was a great experience and writing this review makes me pololi all over again. Although the shortage of seats was a small downside to the meal, this did not hinder the dining experience greatly and I definitely look forward to visiting again to try out different flavours in the near future. (:', 'I had this major omega-3 craving on a work day so I went to Poloni with a friend during lunch hour.  The place was not difficult to find, its on the slope of Graham Street in Central, slightly above the wet market. Stop when you see bright coloured surf boards at the door.  We were lucky, we got there before the rush hour.  The friendly guy in the store offered a quick poke tasting session to us as first timers (yay!).  We got to try almost all their ahi poke.  Who doesnt like choices?  I think we tried 5 to 6 kinds of tuna.  The tuna chunks came in decent size  they were substantial enough yet not too big that you had to bite it in half. They had quite a broad spectrum of ahi pokes  from rich, creamy ones to lighter, soya sauce-based ones. The creamy choices: (1) Asian Creamy Ahi. This one had avocado chunks in it. To be honest, I only ordered this one because I wanted avocado. Otherwise, it tasted bland. A little but of salt would definitely help.  (2) Wasabi Mayo Ahi. This had a very faint hint of wasabi. I was expecting a kick from the wasabi but it wasnt there. (3) Spicy Mayo Ahi. As you can guess from the name, it was spicy and it has mayo. That was pretty much it.The lighter options: (4) Ginger Shoyu Ahi. I liked this one. The tuna chunks were coated with ginger bits and marinated in shoyu. The ginger was not too overpowering and the shoyu sauce provided the saltiness to bring the poke together. (5) Hong Kong Style Ahi. This was an interesting one. It tasted like curry fishballs on the streets, but with the texture of raw fish! (6) Thai Style Ahi. This had a distinct taste. There was marinated in lemon grass. I am not sure if I like tuna with lemon grass though. You can have your poke on rice (white or brown) or salad or a mix of both. My friend and I both picked rice as neither of us ate like the typical Hong Kong girl. We can eat a lot. Yet we couldnt finish the poke bowl as they gave you very generous portion here. I kind of got bored of it half way. The rice was warm (its not sushi rice) but it was quite dry with the ahi poke. I wished they use the soya sauce they put in the Spam Masubi rice in the poke bowls as the moist maker. Speaking of which, the Spam Masubi was good! They warmed the Masubis in the food incubator. I am not a fan of spams so I guess it was not particularly memorable to me. A visit to Poloni was a nice experience. The place was lively and cheerful and the novelty of Hawaiian ahi poke could not be found anywhere else in Hong Kong. 0'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-pololi/184250?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

His little beret was a piece of chocolate. Drink was tasted like soda water with mango syrup.0Gelatinous Pudding Shake ($69).My drink was not really thick and I would say it was more like drinking sweetened milk. A marshmallow with an image of the dog was placed on top. Sucking on my drink, there was a lot of huge chunks of custard pudding on the bottom.0Taco Rice in a Cup of Friendship ($139).When this arrived, it looked exactly like what was shown on the menu!It was cute to look at. The rice was in the shape of the dog. There was actually quite a bit of rice because the entire cup was filled with rice. However, it was cold. I guess it took them a while to make the shape. His hat was half a meat ball and his friend was a bit of mash potato. All was stuck together with a piece of pasta. The meat sauce was ok and tasted more like bolognese than taco filling. We weren't sure what the green clover were made of. We suspect some sort of fish meat?0Bagel Special Pancake Tower ($149).If you order certain items you can keep the small yellow Pompompurin cup that is found on the dish. There's a limited daily quota and we got one. They give it to you a new one in a small box. The pancakes were ok. A bit dry. It was layered with custard cream that wasn't too sweet.0Pompompurin Mango Parfait ($119).This was bigger than we expected. The parfait had a Pompompurin in custard pudding shape. The parfait included mango slices, two scoops of ice cream and fruit. Digging to the bottom was a layer of custard! It was actually pretty good but far too decadent to finish.0Prices maybe expensive but portion size was actually quite large to make up for it. Food tasted ok wasn't great but a lot of effort was done to recreate Pompompurin and stick to this theme. Design of the cafe was excellent as it really stuck to theme.

Japan. Their current branch in Hong Kong is located in Causeway Bay, right next to Sogo. You have to go down a flight of stairs that are decorated with a cute story of Pompompurin and how he came to be. However, there is an elevator available. It's located in the Macau Yat Yuen Center.The cafe was super cute. The chairs were shaped like Pompompurin. There were Pompompurin plushies found at every table so there was no need to fight for one.0Even the ceiling was cute!0The walls had drawings of the cute little dog.00They also have a tiny gift shop to buy items such as water bottles and stationary.The plates and placemat were all themed with the yellow pudding loving dog.00It was pretty quiet. I think maybe 3 other people were there. I guess, he's not as popular as Hello Kitty?? So, we could pretty much sit anywhere and we had a lot of fun taking photos of everything. Selfies for all!Menu was in English and Chinese. They have photos of all the food. So, we ordered a number of items. Now the true test. Does it look like the photos in the menu? Or some slopped together item?Ice Cream on Mango Soda ($64).The one on the left is the mango soda. The scoop of vanilla ice cream was in the shape of the dog. His little beret was a piece of chocolate. Drink was tasted like soda water with mango syrup.0Gelatinous Pudding Shake ($69).My drink was not really thick and I would say it was more like drinking sweetened milk. A marshmallow with an image of the dog was placed on top. Sucking on my drink, there was a lot of huge chunks of custard pudding on the bottom.0Taco Rice in a Cup of Friendship ($139).When this arrived, it looked exactly like what was shown on the menu!It was cute to look at. The rice was in the shape of the dog. There was actually quite a bit of rice because the entire cup was filled with rice. However, it was cold. I guess it took them a while to make the shape. His hat was half a meat ball and his friend was a bit of mash potato. All was stuck together with a piece of pasta. The meat sauce was ok and tasted more like bolognese than taco filling. We weren't sure what the green clover were made of. We suspect some sort of fish meat?0Bagel Special Pancake Tower ($149).If you order certain items you can keep the small yellow Pompompurin cup that is found on the dish. There's a limited daily quota and we got one. They give it to you a new one in a small box. The pancakes were ok. A bit dry. It was layered with custard cream that wasn't too sweet.0Pompompurin Mango Parfait ($119).This was bigger than we expected. The parfait had a Pompompurin in custard pudding shape. The parfait included mango slices, two scoops of ice cream and fruit. Digging to the bottom was a layer of custard! It was actually pretty good but far too decadent to finish.0Prices maybe expensive but portion size was actually quite large to make up for it. Food tasted ok wasn't great but a lot of effort was done to recreate Pompompurin and stick to this theme. Design of the cafe was excellent as it really stuck to theme. I was pretty impressed as far as theme restaurants go. This is probably one of the best in Hong Kong! Would probably return but I don't like him as much as I like Hello Kitty."", ""Food here was excellent! 3 people waited around 20mins at lunch time for a table. Got the taco rice, the spaghetti cabonara and the curry rice and all were so big and tasted really good! They were well made and super cute - didn't want to eat it! Also got the pancake dessert which was quite yum and also got the free mug to take home. the decorations inside was super cute and very unique to Hong Kong! worth the money especially for the size and quality of the food, the location which is next to sogo and the cuteness. 00""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-pompompurin-cafe/478565?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

Shop is small to but with a very good toliet. I like it. very functional. the pork is very juicy and chewable. you can taste the freshness inside out the body and the hot layer of the katsu make you feel great and refreshing. they have some sauce and it is also tasty too. the staff will instruct you how to eat and what to do. so you don't have to do anything. it also come with soup and little side dish but I like the main part.0"", ""Have been getting takeaway twice now and so far no complaints at all about the food, but the price is a bit on the high side for a lunch takeaway. But in this case you do get what you paid for.Their Pork Tenderloin Set as well as the Aged Pork Sirloin Set were both delicious and of high quality. The pork was juicy with a crunchy coat. Although deep fried it wasn't greasy at all.This place is definitely worth a visit if you feel like Tonkatsu!"", 'Located in a basement on Wellington Street, Porker is a Japanese style restaurant that specializes in making delicious katsudon.00This Mr Pig spokesperson is really cute! He is on the staff shirt, together withTake It Easy Man.0We wanted to try different types of pork cutlet on the menu, so we ordered two sets which pretty much covered everything.The upper one is the Full House Set with cheese minced cutlet, sirloin and tenderloin cutlets. The lower one is Tenderloin Cutlet Curry.The Full House Set was amazing to let you have a taste of everything. The cheese minced cutlet was gorgeous! I love the molten cheese inside the minced cutlet. They went so well with each other. The sirloin and tenderloin cutlets had distinguish tastes and textures, which were both so good that gave us a serious foodgasm!We ordered the Tenderloin Cutlet Curry to try out the curry, and it did not disappoint. Japanese curry is usually sweet instead of spicy, but this one is quite hot indeed! Love that there was more curry than rice!Something not to miss is the shredded cabbage that comes with the set. Make sure you try it with the sesame sauce and sour sauce provided. I think the sesame sauce is homemade, as the sesame is so flavoured! Even a veggie hater like me finished every single shred of cabbage!0We also ordered this Pork Sandwich. The bread was fluffy and toasted to have a crunchy surface, which wrapped a piece of juicy cutlet inside. The shredded cabbage was mixed with yellow mustard, which topped up the flavour of the veggies and sandwich as a whole.Again, we ordered a bit too much. The portion was really generous. We first wanted the full house set and the sandwich. But we were told that there was half a sandwich left, so we got the curry set also. However, we were later informed that there was a whole sandwich. We wanted to cancel the curry set, but it was made already, so we ended up with too much food. Yet, I was able to take the left over home and hopefully it would taste as good after reheating.0'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-porker/539723?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
556,Posto Pubblico,Central,Italian,3.8,211.5,6.0,"Posto has always been my favourite ever since I moved here in Hong Kong. So many Italian restaurants have come and gone in this city but I'm happy to see that this one has endured the test of food business turnovers. Competition is tough and having transients (expats) as patrons that leave the city within a year or two, I imagine it must be tough surviving in this industry.....The thing though is that I've never felt as welcomed as I do whenever I go to Posto and I think, apart from the lovely dishes that they serve, this is really what makes me come back: the hospitality which Hong Kong restaurants have yet to cultivate.I'm glad this restaurant is still thriving. If you ever come to Hong Kong, do drop by this restaurant. It's friendly and it doesn't hurt that their food is always served on point.Caprese - homemade mozzarella, heirloom tomatoes $ 1890Caprese - homemade mozzarella, heirloom tomatoes $ 189"", '6.5/10The best thing about ordering pizza, secondi or any pasta here is that it includes a complimentary lunch buffet. The meat balls and grilled chicken were really very good. My colleaguess pizzas were lovely too.I ordered a pasta alla vodka in order to compare it with the one served at Carbone. My colleagues ordered pizza, linguini with clams and a Brooklyn sandwich. The pasta was al dente and bursting with tomato flavor. It was less rich than the one at Carbone but Im still happy with it. My only quibble is this: its virtually the same as the pasta being served at the buffet! Well, being extra positive, at least for $30 odd dollars, I get to have warm pasta served to me directly. Lesson learnt: Caveat emptor ~ let the buyer beware. (But for this mishap, I would have given this a smiley face.) 01000', 'Usually I try to steer clear of American-Italian dining places here. Their overpowering ketchup-like red sauce and the sticky, over-creamy white sauce are too dreadful for me. The only saving grace is the association of these eateries with my favourite movie series ""Godfather"", in which there are always scenes of mafia members enjoying a plate of pasta in the midst of chaos and bloodshed. 0I have walked past this place many times before and was drawn by its subdued yet classy decor and high ceiling, but it was always full. This time I deliberately went there after busy lunch hours and was whisked to a table right away.At the corner of the menu it is written ""Posto Pubblico uses organic and natural farm-fresh produce sourced locally from Homegrown Foods...""and on their website it says:""ALL OUR MEATS, POULTRY AND EGGS ARE HORMONE FREE AND ALL DISHES ARE PREPARED WITHOUT MSG TO BRING YOU HEALTHIER, EXCITING MEALS EVERYDAY""I guess at least I have to appreciate the place for this.0The price for drinks are a bit on the high side. I simply cannot hide my disdain for places claiming to serve brunch but with no complimentary drink. Come on, at least you can give me a cup of tea or coffee!It is a bit weird to spot Super Bock there though.Bucatini,amatriciana ($155) and veal meatballs ($120)...0Bucatini,amatriciana ($155) and veal meatballs ($120)...First came their signature dish, veal meatballs ($120). The sauce was a little too bland, and the meat was a little too rubbery. For me western meatballs is no way on the same pedestal as our Chinese counterparts. Then came the much pleasant surprise - bucatini all\'amatriciana ($155) (""alla gricia"" - a ""white"" sauce of pancetta and pecorino - is also available with this pasta at same price). I always applaud myself for being ""open-minded"" despite my perception for certain types of food or restaurants (ha ha!). The tomato sauce for this dish was far more sophisticated with the right balance of sweetness and tanginess. It was a beautiful pasta dish which felt wholesome.Linguini Vongole, white ($160)0Linguini Vongole, white ($160)I was torn between red and white sauce for this dish as I really can\'t stand the sticky cheesy American style white sauce. But finally I succumbed to the waiter\'s recommendation and it turned out that I really wanted to kiss him on the cheek. The clams were fresh and plentiful, and much to my delight, the sauce was more of a clear, white-wine based one infused with the natural juice of the fresh clams. We loved this linguine alle vongole so much that we went for a second order. The second dish was as nice as the first one, which may mean the place does make delicious pasta and is not a fluke at all.This place will pop up in my mind whenever I have a yearning for reasonably-priced, nicely-cooked linguine alle vongole.', 'It has a simple and traditional dcor, something different from the vibrant city.

Dining area is spacious, well-lit and comfortable, with contemporary Chinese style decor to match, like a typical modern upscale restaurant in metropolitan cities in China.Good service with attentive, polite staff.We ordered:Ma lan tou ($46)With mild seasoned filling, a mellow hint of sesame oil, served cold. A good start.Spring onion pancakes ($22)Surprise: not the usual airy puff pastry-life pancake, but more like flatbread, and deep fried. It may be different, but enjoyable in its own way, with greasy crunch mouthfuls.Dan Dan noodles ($38)Ordered without any specifications on spiciness, yet the soup base was still very spicy and left a stinging sensation in the mouth even after the meal. The oily soup surface looked like it was doused with a bottle of La You (oil-based chili sauce). Noodles itself was not particularly exceptional, perhaps it was spoiled by the overwhelmingly hot soup.Steamed vegetarian dumplings  ($30)Skin is just right, neither too thick nor too thin, with a hearty chopped vegetable mixture. Will order again next time.Regular Xiao Long Bao ($28)Pork filling was juicy, very pleasantly sweet and skin doesn't break upon picking up.Vegeable and meat Xiao Long Bao ($28)Even better than the regular xiao long bao - slight addition of chopped leafy greens complements the juicy, soft pork filling very well. Even my meat-loving friend enjoyed it!Sweet sticky rice roll ($22) Particularly mentionable is the chopped peanut, white sesame and white sugar mixture, combining to give much texture and flavors that match well. The thoroughly deep-fried thin breadstick (you tiao), resulting in a  in the gives extra crunch. Will try the savory rice roll next time. Double-side fried noodles with shredded pork dipping soup ($60)Freshly deep fried ramen was drained well so it doesn't feel greasy at all. Soup was particularly enjoyable, looked like hot and sour soup but plainly savory, with a consistency just right for dipping. Lots of julienned white bamboo shoots and bell peppers and soft shredded pork.Egg white scallop fried rice ($62) (takeoput)A very deceiving name, with minimal scallops  - it might as well have been called egg white fried rice! Otherwise, the medium grain white rice was tossed well with the broken egg white, chopped carrots and siu tong choi (looks like pak choy but less crunchy, with a greener stem) Definitely not worth ordering.Noticed they call themself the Dim Sum expert of Shanghai in the takeout bag; perhaps that explains their good dumplings and sticky rice roll, but the fried rice and dan dan noodles were not up to standards.A good choice for a very comfortable experience, with good service and seating, but the quality of the food really depends on what you order.Ma lan tou0Ma lan touSpring onion FLATbread0Spring onion FLATbreadDan dan noodles1Dan dan noodlesSteamed vegetarian dumplings0Steamed vegetarian dumplingsVegetable and meat Xiao Long Bao0Vegetable and meat Xiao Long BaoRegular Xiao Long Bao0Regular Xiao Long BaoSweet sticky rice roll0Sweet sticky rice rollFried noodles with shredded pork soup0Fried noodles with shredded pork soupEgg white scallop fried rice0Egg white scallop fried rice""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-premier-wang-jia-sha/45659?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw
559,Prince Restaurant,Causeway Bay,Chinese,4.2,140.0,,"A Fine Lunch At The Pricey Prince RestaurantIn this Sunday afternoon, I brought my family to the Prince Restaurant for dim sum where it was renowned for its fine and pricey dinning. The restaurant environment was nice and quiet, pretty spacious and was nicely furnished. The area was filled up with well-dressed customers and waiter. We were seated at a table in the private area. The utensils were nicely setup and nice pre-meal snacks were served before we ordered our food.1) Pan Fried Rice Flour Rolls With Scallop in XO Sauce $48This dish was heavenly delicious. The rice flour rolls were fried just right to give a crispy golden brown outside and a soft and hot inside. It gave a mild XO taste, not too salty nor too sweet. Despite the rice flour rolls, the side ingredients were scrumptious too. There were several big soft tasty Scallops, green fresh bean curds and crispy young arc hoi at sides.2) Cold Cut String Bean With Sesame Sauce $58This dish was ordered by my sister so I was surprised that the dish was cold when I had my first bite on the string bean. Yet the sesame sauce was extremely good and went very well with the fresh green string bean. The combining taste was very refreshing. Big thumb up for this dish.3) Crispy Fried Bean Curd With Spicy Rock Salt $48This fried bean curd was delicious too. Once again, the bean curd is nicely fried with a crispy golden brown outside and a very soft bean curd on the inside. The bean curd once taken in would dissolve on your palate immediately. It was only slightly spicy and the rock salt seasoning gave a great flavour to the dish. The fried bean curd was not as oily made as many other restaurants did.4) Boiled Seasonal Vegetable $48The seasonal vegetable was disappointing, although the veggie was fresh but the dish was tasteless. Even soya sauce were added to it, the dish did not really give much flavour.5) Streamed Egg Yolk Buns $26The Streamed Egg Yolk Buns was one of my favourite dishes. I always love to eat the outer layer of the bun separately, this layer was a bit too thin that when I tore the outer layer off, I broke a part of the bread and the inside filling was exposed. The Streamed Egg Yolk was marvelously done, when you had your first bite on the bun, the melting filling was all already waiting to rush out. The egg yolk filling was in a shinny golden yellow colour and gave you a creamy fantastic taste. People who love streamed egg yolk bun must love the bun Prince Restaurant offers.6) Baked Barbecued Pork Buns $30This Baked Barbecued Pork Bun in Chinese was called The Worlds Best Bun. Being curious as I was, I ordered the bun to give it a try. Quite disappointingly, the Barbecued Pork Bun was nothing special at all. The bun was a very soft and sweet one, I personally think the bun would taste better if its outer layer was crispier.7) Sauted Mixed Mushrooms with Truffle $58This Sauted Mixed Mushroom was preciously seasoned with truffle which although I could not really taste the truffle, the mushrooms themselves were very appetizing.8) Deep Fried Turnips PastriesDeep Fried Turnips Pastries is always one of my must order dish when it comes to dim sum. Not many restaurants can make good quality turnips pastries, but Prince Restaurant is definitely one of them. Their deep fried turnips pastries had a crispy outer layer and were consisted of heaps of soft and light inside layers with hot delicious turnips. Another great choice other than the Streamed Egg Yolk Buns.After tasting the above dim sum Prince Restaurant offers, I personally reckon most of their foods are nicely done. Although a bit pricey, the restaurant services and the chiefs efforts shown in both of their food ingredients and quality definitely worth the price (except the veggie). The Pan Fried Rice Flour Rolls With Scallop, Streamed Egg Yolk Buns and the Deep Fried Turnips Pastries are the dishes I highly recommended.www.cinnamon4coffee.blogspot.comHeavenly Scumptious Pan Fried rice rolls0Heavenly Scumptious Pan Fried rice rollsCaught me by surprise cold string beans0Caught me by surprise cold string beansCrispy Yummy Bean Curd0Crispy Yummy Bean CurdHorribly Tastless Veggie0Horribly Tastless Veggiemelted center Streamed egg Yolk Buns0melted center Streamed egg Yolk BunsNothing Special World's Best Buns0Nothing Special World's Best BunsGreat Muschrooms with Truffle0Great Muschrooms with TruffleThumb Up for Deep Fried Turnips Pastries!0Thumb Up for Deep Fried Turnips Pastries!"", 'We ordered the dim sum set for 2 ladies.

560,Pro-Burger,Central,American,3.0,47.7,,"Don\'t you just love the ideas of trends coming and going -- Stockmarket trends fashion trends, food trends...etc. While thinking you can only go so far with the crunching numbers or the mixing and matching along the lines of the little black dress, food trends are more variant in terms of the type of change you can have...consider the quintessence of raw materials being prepared by a group of men and women in white chef\'s jackets -- in the kitchen that is. BURGERS, an American staple, has never gone out of style or off the culinary radar of many throughout the years. PRO-BURGER of Central, is joining many in the quest to revamp the ultimate classic for the American style of generosity.""Follow your nose"" is my advice locating Pro-Burger. The familiar smell of hot grease on hot plate will lead you to a tiny 5-seat joint, with kitchen occupying one side and stools on the other. No staff in freshly starched white uniform, (but they do wear baseball caps), but they are too busy multitasking between flipping burgers, toasting sesame-flecked buns and frying potato wedges. I heard of a burger with a 300+ gram patty. Upon seeing the picture, I was determined to try just exactly how PRO this burger joint could be.Staffing is adequate as orders crunch in the cash machines faster than the burger flipping acts -- char, flip, cover, and char some more. The clinking of the metal spatulas sounded slightly familiar with the Japanese Teppanyaki, only in a rather foreign rustic way. A promising splash of hot fat arise as potato wedges sink deep with a sizzle. When the wedges emerged again they have a golden brown coating, followed by an intoxicating aroma of starch fried in hot grease. The burger arrived promptly enough, so disproportionately large and dripping with fat, accompanied in the burger by crisp lettuce and deep red tomato slices. The halved burger, pictured here, is too large even for a grown adult like myself. The filling -- the center of the patty, was quiveringly rare with a moisture resembling a blue steak. Digging in, the patty was slightly than it should be, but the centre was moist. Each bite seemed laden with herbs like thyme and oregano. As I wondered what good dry herbs would make than fresh ones, I realized that my expectation was a pro burger was not entirely satisfied by the enormous burger. The herbs have overpowered the sheer intensity of essential beefiness in a burger, in a way as if the kitchen staff has misread the recipe mistaking ""pinch"" with ""punch"". Savoring the beef I realized that the crusty sesame buns could soak up the drizzling fat from the meat patty itself, despite they are crusty on their own. The lettuce, cheese and tomatoes are satisfactory.  While the burger itself was good but not great, the potato wedges were not forotten. The generosity part has stopped after the burger and the soda by the can (served with a cupful of ice and a slice of lemon). The potato wedges tasted strangely starchy somehow, and only faintly reminded me that they are not from a potato cut earlier but rather, somewhere in a paper bag in the deep freeze. The combo will fittingly fill up a hungry man with an enormous appetite and no doubt will Pro-Burger attracts a lot of folks curious enough to register with their carnivorous nature at some point.  Yet the burger itself , so enormous and out of proportion (not just the size, but the meat/seasoning proportions) was not so great. I think it deserves a visit if you have never been, and even better if you will ignore the part where the chef developing the burger is hotel-training, bearing in mind that it is not the ""training in 5 star hotel"" that makes the burger, but the meat itself.

As they are newly opened, this was their soft opening menu. Unsure how this will change in the future. Menu is in English and Chinese. There is no 10% service charge.0I ordered Pun's Three Treasure Noodle ($78). It included beef brisket, tripe and vein. There was also a couple of pieces of vegetable and daikon. The brisket was delicious. Soft, literally melted in your mouth and was packed with flavor! The vein was also soft and braised to super juiciness. The tripe was thick and tender. Daikon was soaked with the flavors of the soup.0The soup was a nice broth had a heavy beef flavor but not overly salty.0The noodles were the thick kind and was a bit under done, thus I could still taste a bit of the starch in it. The only con in an otherwise fantastic bowl of noodles.0I added $10 for the appetizer. It was well ... disappointing. It tasted fine but it wasn't very impressive. Nothing really stood out. Not even the eggplant. I would save your $10 on adding an appetizer.0The meal came with a drink so I chose Pun's Orange Juice. What was that? Well, it just taste like Mr. Juicy. I guess I was hoping for freshly squeezed Taiwanese oranges but nope. It was ok and I do appreciate a place that offers juice with their sets instead of the usual. Oddly felt more healthy.0The food was fairly good and I will be back. Service was ok and they have a lot of staff. Only complaint on the service was they are a bit cha chan teng in that I sat down and haven't even looked at the menu and the staff literally waited right next to you, expecting you to order. I hate feeling stressed to order so I hope they learn to give customers the menu and come back later. Plus, they were a bit new so kinks need to be worked on. Such as there was a lot of confusion on orders. I saw staff wandering aimlessly with food wondering where it went, peering at each receipt on the table before placing it down.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-puns-food/579061?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

I have been frequenting this place for many years and it pains me that the price is every increasing due to the landlord rental pressures. In its heyday a lunch would cost around HK30 but has almost doubled in price to HK60 over the past 6 years...My favourite is the Tom Yum Gong Soup noodle. It has plentiful of condiments and you can choose from Rice Noodles, Thai Rice Noodles and Ho Fun. What makes this item stand out for other places is the fact that soup is not a watered down version normally accompanied with soup noodles in most joints but actually a full sized portion of the soup. It\'s a very filling and super satisfying soup noodle lunch.They also have a lot of daily dishes which is very much of the home cooked Thai food you might see on the streets of Bangkok. They are always bursting with flavour. Every often if you catch them they will have this spicy sour pork soup, very much a ""peasant"" dish but absolutely bursting with flavours.....The place is often open to the early hours - well past midnight especially on the Friday and Saturday where sometimes I have seen them open until 3am.Hainan Chicken Tom Yum Gong Soup Noodle$ 600Hainan Chicken Tom Yum Gong Soup Noodle$ 60Supplementary InformationLunch sets often includes a lime or lychee drink.', ""I come here several of times a month to get their cheap and cheerful lunch sets ($30 with a choice of nice cold drinks). Just wanted to say that the place serves honest good food and the staff (mostly Thais) are very friendly. Their curries are not greasy although a tad toned down in terms of spiciness, probably to suit local taste. Portions are on the small side but definitely enough. PS: they tend to dish out huge portions of rice lol.They are open 24-7 and the women work their fingers to the bones.

Because its lunch time there was no a la carte menu. We had a set menu with around 6-8 choices maybe, priced from hkd 128 to 168, ranging from ramen, to doraya with rice. A set included a miso soup, sushi rolls and the main course. Ice cream for Dessert was upon request. Because I was not offered any until I asked for ( because I saw the other have it). I ordered a fried salmon with rice. I was asked if I would like medium for salmon steak. I was nice to have the choice. But it was well done when it arrived.  the rice was ok, quite a big portion.

565,ROKA Japanese Robata Grill ,Admiralty,Japanese,2.5,421.0,0.0,";...!""Japanese"" restaurant from London;Authentic London style Japanese food;Expensive sets.Super mini sushi smaller than half a finger;Efficient service. Nice decor butNot recommended.Fools rush in:I\'ve actually tried Roka ages ago when they still had yakisoba, 5-6 times more expensive than anywhere else but least likely to go wrong. My wife was in the area one day and wished to have lunch. Since I was trying to complete something urgent at work, I suggested having a quick lunch around the area. I didn\'t know what I was thinking at the time but I completely  forgot about the Great Food Hall, L16, Grappas, Shiki or Nadaman (that\'s how rushed I was at work!), instead I suggested Roka...Decor and Service:Very nice decor, spacious with a pretty high ceiling. Counter seats, bar table seats, sofa seats and normal tables seats were available.  The staff members were very polite and efficient. Menu:To my utter dismay, they don\'t serve yakisoba anymore. The lunch menu was not comprehensive, as far as I could recall, two different types of sushi/sashimi set, black cod set and possibly some wagyu sets. All have top up options at extra costs (extra miso soup or a salad...etc.)We ordered a Black Cod Saikyoyaki Set ($248) and a Sushi Set ($238).We were asked whether we\'d like something to drink. We ordered two cups of tea. Those were genmaicha. Black cod:: ,""""0: ,""""Salad: Very average quality veggies with almost no dressing, Japanese or not.Rice: Possibly Japanese rice with some black sesame. Nice presentation. The taste was fine.Eggplant: Quite good.Marinated in light soy sauce. Best part of the meal.Miso soup: Normal miso soup with I believe tofu and kelp.Cod: The cod was cut into three small chunks.  You\'ll know most of the fish oil much have already disappeared. Indeed, the three small pieces of cod were dry and tasteless. Luckily the miso next to it was smooth and sweet. It significantly eased the task of finishing those cods. The red pickled ginger sprinkled on top of the cod is a defining feature of ""Japanese"" food served mostly in English speaking countries, like what I had in many disappointing meals in London. Somehow, some people felt that add pickled ginger or wasabi rendered a dish ""Japanese"", just like adding soy sauce and ginger turned the dish into ""Chinese"" cuisine.Sushi set:First came the steamed egg:,0,A bowl of miso soup was served together with it.To be fair, the egg was not bad. It also came in a bamboo container and a wooden spoon, with spring onions, ginger and coarsely grounded soy bean with miso (the essence of  ""Oriental"" cuisine ).The egg was quite smooth but I can\'t remember what was inside the steamed egg, if any.Then came the sushi:Mini me sushi:: 990: 99The first thing that struck us was the size of the sushis. Those were very small.  It\'s smaller than half of my wife\'s index finger!  Talk to the finger:! ,!0! ,!The ""Edomae"" sushis, salmon, two white bodied fish and egg,  were small and the quality of the fish was no better than any takeaway sushi you get at supermarkets. Even those at supermarkets or takeaway sushi specialists serve bigger and possibly better quality sushis.The hamachi sashimi and tuna sashimi were bad. Even Ihashi at Jordan and at NOBU served better sushi than here.OK """"""""0OK """"""""The maki had avocado, salmon and fish roes, which for some reason were green instead of orange. The taste was fine though.  Lieber ein Ende mit Schrecken als ein Schrecken ohne Ende:The best thing about lunch that day was that it was over really quickly. The lunch sets arrived in a flash. Because of the ultra small portion, the food was consumed in a flash as well. Very efficient service so we got the bill very shortly after we asked for it.The Black Cod Saikyoyaki Set was HK$248 and a Sushi Set HK$238.The two cups of tea cost us HK$38 per cup!The bill came down to HK$610 plus service. Way too expensive for the quality.  Better an end in horror than a horror without end:This meal we had quite a while ago but I\'d really like to get it out of my system, in all sense of the word. As I checked the introduction to this restaurant, I realized that ROKA came from London. No wonder it reminded me of the Japanese restaurants there 10-15 years ago...Not recommended.10-15,,Supplementary Information* I hasten to add that the last time I went to London, which was about a year ago, the food scene improved significantly. Authentic Chinese restaurants sprang up everywhere.', ""Ate the sharing set for 2 pax for lunch. price is HKD 348 / pax.first dish was the sushi cum sashimi plate. for sashimi, there were tuna, yellow fin, and salmon. it was fresh and juicy. only grouse was that the wasabi wasn't enough. it was only a small bit on the plate for two persons to share. there was too much soya sauce as the saucer was large, and too little wasabi. 6 pieces of sushi - standard stuff for that.soup came shortly. there was red or white miso. i tried the red miso. standard stuff.next dish was the grilled cod fish. this one was good. juicy. but not sure if it was oil or thick gravy. there was a vegetable dish which was forgettable. in fact it was so forgettable that i can't remember what vegetable i ate. and the portion was miniscule.then came the mini lamb steak. awesome! we ordered medium for this. it was tender and juicy. no rough lamb odour at all. the best dish of the day.desert was creme brulee with vanilla icecream. it was refreshing. but i'm not the best judge of desert.On service level, it was so-so. In fact, considering the price level here, I would say it was below expectations. Unresponsive service staff, and my pot of tea took over 10 min to arrive. My guess is that most of the service staff were filipinos or similar. Atmosphere was good. Spacious seating arrangement. Clean and comfy. and well-ventilated environment. My suit didn't smell of oil after the meal despite grilling activities about 20m away.

We ordered the Roka lunch set with grill sea bass and the Wagu Sirloin robata lunch set and a Shrimp tempura.To our surprise, the sushi appetizer for the Roka set is quite all right as we are not expecting good sushi from a robata grill restaurant.  Little do we know that was the best part of the meal.The Tempura is very oily and the shrimp has no taste at all. The Wagu sirloin was the probably the best I've ever had.  There is no marbling and no beef taste.  I've actually checked with our server to make sure it is they did not made a mistake and served us regular beef instead.  It certainly is not Wagu and is not even up the the normal standard of any sirloin I've seen.Next comes the chopped Tuna with rice for the Roka set.  The fatty tuna has no taste at all and is probably worse than the ones you get from any cheap Japanese restaurant.The Sea Bass was ok but at this point, we are so disappointed we have lost our appetite completely.All and all. it was the worst experience I've had for some time.  The food is horrible, the service was not up to standard for a restaurant of this grade.   The server does not seen a bit surprise even though we did not finish any of our dishes (Wagu beef untouched!)The rice is not cooked probably and even the pickled side dishes is bad.May be dinner will be better but I just cannot give myself any excuse to go to this restaurant again."", 'I went there once and had a bad experience.The food was pricey and the portions were small.  I had a grilled steak set lunch, and the steak was mediocre and only lukewarm when it was served. One thing that I found particularly annoying was that they didnt offer us any drinking water, and we had to pay $38 for a green tea which was plain as water.  It was not short of staff but there were many inexperienced waiters running around and few seemed to know what they were doing.  I was still hungry after paying $200 for lunch.

But an additional $20 was required for daily soup and dessert bar (with only 3 choices). We all ordered a main course and soup. The bread was a bit cold, while the food tooknearly 20minutes to arrive.In addition, the service wasratherpoor. When we asked one of the staff if coffee or tea was served with every item on the lunch menu (the layout made it seem confusing), he said ""I\'m not sure"" and went to get another guy who answered ""yes"", but not very convincingly.Then, we placed our orders.A lady marked down what each person ordered. But when a waiter arrived with our soups later, he did not refer to what we had ordered and just placed the dishes in front of us randomly. For example, I ordered a cream of corn soup, but he put a mushroom soup in front of me without asking or saying anything.I ordered a ""wildmushroom linguine"", and at least 2 of my companions heard me say so. But a waiter came and served me a ""truffle with wagyu cheek linguine"". At first, I thought maybe a co-worker had ordered this dish, but it turned out they didn\'t. So I told the waiter thatthis was not what I had ordered,and he said ""there\'s mushroom in this dish"", much to my surprise. So I statedplainly thatI had ordered a wild mushroom linguine, and the waiter insisted that this was a linguine withsomemushrooms in it.After a minute or so of confusion,the lady who took the order approached andasked me if I had ordered the vegetarian option and I said yes. She realised that she had written down the wrong dish and offered to make me a new one, to which I refused and said it was fine(since it could take another 20 minutes, you never know.)Of course, an apology of some sort would have been nice, but the lady left without uttering a word.As for the waiter, hestated for the third time that there was mushroom in the dish before he moved on to serve other people.That made me feel that I did something wrong and should be the oneshouldering the blame. \'Wild mushroom\' and \'truffle and wagyu\' are twocompletely different things, you know.Due to the unpleasant experience and unsatisfactory service, I\'m definitely not coming here again, and I advise others to beware should they venture here.'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/wan-chai-ramas-oyster-bar-grill/46390?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

576,Red Chili Restaurant,Causeway Bay,Thai,3.1,60.0,,"There is always SOMETHING wrong with Thai food -- too tart on the lime juice, too much heat in the chilies, and too salty in everything else. The lightness and freshness within the popular cuisine has been lost through \'tuning up\' to locals\' palates. It\'s not a good thing, it\'s like fusion food took a wrong turn. I couldn\'t say Red Chili has authentic Thai food, but at the very least, I didn\'t have the same awful experiences I\'ve had recently in two other joints. I found the location rather convenient, and seating inside of the Red Chili is good. Not prime especially when you count the outside it\'s like sitting on the streets with passers by looking at (from a close distance) what you\'re eating, and more embrassingly, how you\'re eating it.Location and seating aside, Red Chili has an open ambience to it, so casual and unpretentious of it all. The wooden window and mirrors decorations and the other wall-painting of Thai sculptures offer an ethnic accent to the entire place. The menu was extensive and easy to read, with plenty of pictures featured in it. During the week set lunches are available, pricing below $50 you will get a bowlful of noodle soup or  plate of featured rice (say, Hainanese Chicken) and a complimentary beverage. We had Hainanese Chicken with an iced ""bel fruit tea"" while the other a Lemongrass Pork Chop with Rice and iced hibiscus tea ($38). We also ordered an order of Deep Fried Shrimp Cakes ($30). The chicken was tender and moist, with a good flavour on the rice as well, accompanied by the lightest flavoring with pandanus, lemongrass and lime. The porkchop was deep fried after marinated in lemongrass and a blend of herbs, served piping hot and cut into strips. Not to miss out the dipping sauce is oil-based homemade dipping sauce made with a handful of dried chilies, palm sugar, lemongrass and dried shrimps. The rice was fluffy and vegetables were green and sweet to the core. The shrimp cakes, 4 pieces per order, were rather dense and white throughout with laces of coral colour throughout. It tasted fresh without the sweet chili dipping sauce. An accompanying beverage of iced hibiscus tea was served, the colour of purest puce, with a taste most resembled a sweeter version of the blackcurrant drink we mix up at home, but with a decided tang to it.The signature ""Tom Yum Soup Noodle Soup with Prawns"" ($48) was also good. Served in a white soup bowl, the soup spread the aroma of lemongrass, red chilies and a whiff of coriander leaves. The soup itself was milky with an orange glow of oil floating on the top. The noodles were of the thinner rice quality. Green Papaya Salad ($38) was a heaped portion of julienned green papaya, tossed with a tart dressing made primarily with fish sauce, lime juice and for a texture, roasted peanuts and toasted dried shrimps chopped up blended in with small bits of green beans and a few cherry tomatoes.Fish Cakes (4 pcs, $25) are chewy and piping hot, with a fragrant aroma of thin strips of kaffir lime leaves blended in throughout. Coriander leaves were also in the mix. This herb and fish combination is common in Thai cuisine and certainly working very well in this dish. We had Glutinous Rice with Mango ($38) for dessert. A heart shape of glutinous rice, half white, half dark variety, and half a ripe mango served on the side, with a thick jacket of coconut sauce on the top. The coconut sauce provided a perfect foil to the rice but I would prefer it a little cooler (temperature wise) and the dark glutinous rice to be softer. The mango, on the other hand, was flawlessly ripe and sweet as honey.Having the courage to try Thai food in CWB again is something new, and more encouraging for me to pay a second visit and possibly more in the future. I realized that Red Chili can easily become a popular place among CWB dwellers. My only hope is that the establishment will continue to serve up quality food, and not to be affected with the comeback of the cuisine that emphasizes on ""freshness"" and ""clean flavours"".00Ethnic accented decor.0Ethnic accented decor.Hibiscus (L), Bel Fruit Tea0Hibiscus (L), Bel Fruit Tea'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-red-chili-restaurant/26849?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

Comfortable with high ceiling and nice view. The tables were reasonably spaced apart.This place was quite popular but fortuantely we managed to get a seat without waiting. They have a sushi bar area, teppenyaki area, a number of sofa seats for 4-6 next to the window and other tables for two in the middle. The tables were reasonably spaced apart.sofa0sofa 0 , ,,Soba0, ,,SobaGood attention to detail:0Menu:Pretty comprehensive. They serve what you'd expect from most Japanese restaurants, sushi sets, sashimi sets, tempura, various types of don sets, beef sets and teppenyaki sets.The teppenyaki sets looked interesting but since it was our first time here, I decided to order their signature set, the Rei Special Lunch Set.Rei Special Lunch Set (added $40 to have undon instead of rice):First came the sashimi: - ,0 - , Two thick slices for each of the following: Salmon: No complaints. Pretty fresh and thick;Hamachi: I'd give this 75/100 (I have a lower standard when it comes to sashimi when compared with my wife); andChu toro: (I though it's 75/100 but my wife though it's just 60/100 because of the tendons).70070The wasabi wasn't the toothpaste one but not too fresh.They only had one type of shoyu available for everything - i.e. not a special one for sashimi, which wasn't too professional considering an Izakaya like Doraya also uses it. Kosyu took it one step further - they chilled their sushi shoyu, which is even more professional.Then came the full set: - 40,,40,,''un''...0 - 40,,40,,''un''...Salad:A few slices of cabbage with sliced tomato and some ponzu. OkTempura: Two shrimps , one piece of white bodies fish and one shiitake. The shrimp was too salty.  Somehow it got the impression that the shrimps were frozen ones. They might have been defrosted in salt water. Not very appealing at all.The batter for each tempura was crispy but oily. Not recommended.  Two pieces of eel: The sauce was too overwhelmingly sweet. One piece of eel was as hard as rubber. The other small piece was slightly better. When it comes to Unagi , I only trust Kosyu.The udon which I paid HK$40 for was really average stuff. Not very different from instant udon packs. The soup might be home made. It's less salty than most instant unob packs. Nevertheless, definitely Not worth $40.All in all, at HK$298 (plus service and $40 for the udon) the set is overpriced.    Angus Beef Don Set:My wife ordered Angus beef don set: - ,HK$230   : ,,...0 - ,HK$230   : ,,... She ordered well done. According to her, the beef was quite good. However, too much mustard was placed on top of the beef. I tried the rice of that set. It was not bad. Didn't taste like Japanese pearl rice though, it tasted like Mainland vareity. (HK$230)Conclusion:The bill came down to HK$647 including HK$20 for tea plus 10% service. Ouch.If it wasn't for the friendly service, I would have given this place a crying face because of my tempura set.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-rei/43876?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

Perhaps their all-you-can-eat nights (Tuesday chicken, Wednesday ribs, Thursday beef short ribs, Friday steak) has a better turn out. Two waitresses working the scene, service was efficient and polite, can't fault them except one dropped a plate. Oops.My hubby had the seafood gumbo which came in a tiny ramekin (think creme brulee), but apparently there was enough rice to make it filling enough for an appetiser. I had a much more visually appealing and stomach rewarding spinch salad with feta and pecans. Both well seasoned and made with fresh ingredients. Simple done well.My spare ribs was an awesome 8-bone rack that covered the length of the plate, with a sticky, not-too-sweet sauce that was just enough to cover it without smothering and overpowering it. Which also makes for easy, clean eating without sauce and grease dripping everywhere. Extra sauce won extra points, though it probably wasn't necessarily as the ribs were so delicious with the right balance of flavouring.Slaw was good, crunchy, not too mayo-ey.Very decent portion of ribs0Very decent portion of ribsPulled pork, awesome.

Even before we started eating you could feel the warmth and soul resonating from the atmosphere - decor consisted of post-Katrina window frames and shelves, stark light bulbs in wire cages, and steel chairs. Rumor was it that some of these items were transferred from the hurricane battered New Orleans to the restaurant in memory of those lost and the damage done. That is some true heart!The music also fit the ambience very well, with the most soulful voices in music warmly playing in the background. I wouldn't be surprised if they had curators carefully pairing their food with music!

My friend with the Soup of the Day - Cauliflower Cream Soup, a luscious, rich and thick soup charateristic of most cream based soups.

It was thicker than expected, with an almost chili-like texture, but a wonderful medley of flavors from the stewed vegatables and spices, and the occassional scallops and prawns swimming in the stew gave it some bite, while the slight intensity of the peppers provided the kick. Despite the okra, which I'm not particularly fond of, this was easily my favorite dish here. Also Ceelo Green's blaring tenor voice in the background somehow perfectly complemented this soup.As innocent as this pasta looks, it packs a punch!0As innocent as this pasta looks, it packs a punch!Next up was the main, a Penne Jambalaya, an unexpectedly spicy dish. In fact, so spicy that my friend couldn't taste the paprika on his side of Fries (+$25) after. It was a twist on the tradionally rice-based jambalaya, just substituting Penne as the key carbohydrate. Flavors were still wonderfully packed with cajun spices, with a good amount of smokiness and spiciness (that I suspect came from the Andouille), and well-seasoned chunks of meat. I prefer the traditional version, but this one was still delicious, especially if you enjoy the extra heat! For a dish like this, they (the mystery curators) paired it with Johnny Cash's cover of Personal Jesus and Hurt in his amazing raspy barritone voice. Unpretentious good food - don't forget to add the red stuff!...0Unpretentious good food - don't forget to add the red stuff!...The BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich also did not disappoint (It's actually a burger). The pulled pork was smokey and succulent with strands of fibres that fell apart in your mouth, and was accompanied by a sweet honey-like sauce and sharp pungent purple onions. A nice touch was the slightly charred bun that had a crunch to it. This is a wonderfully satisfying sandwich, and ranks right up there with the roast beef sandwich at Westwood Carvery (still the winner for me though ;p ), just remember to add the Tobasco or Crystal hot sauce to bring it to the next level! If I may mention, we had John Legend accompanying us on this one.0::||Good for||::Comfort food with flavors that penetrate even cold-shrouded taste buds.

That sounded like a great deal so I went. The $98 is actually just for the salad buffet. If you add a sandwich it is $70 more. Or you can just order a sandwich for around $100.  There is no 10% service charge. I decided to order a Po' Boy (a type of sandwich impossible to find elsewhere in HK). There were different choices of fillings like oyster and shrimp and I chose Soft Shell Crab.Some of the more unusual items in the salad buffet wereCorn Maque Choux. Again I have never had this elsewhere. It was a warm dish and it had quite a depth of flavours, I couldn't identify any one of them aside from corn but it was really rich, filling, and delicious.Fried Chicken Pasta Salad. This was the only meat dish in the buffet and tasted like a mild mac & cheese with small chopped up pieces of fried chicken.Green Salad with Beetroot dressing. I didn't try the dressing but it looked good.Then the sandwich came and wow! It was a whole intact soft shell crab, fried so well that each claw and leg were distinctly separate. I'm not the type that takes pictures of food but this was too good looking to pass up.Soft Shell Crab Po' Boy2Soft Shell Crab Po' BoyAmazingly the sandwich tasted almost as good as it looked too. The well seasoned batter was crispy and the crab was soft and fresh. It was served with a remoulade sauce on the side that complemented the crab well. The only negative was the bread, it was too thick and soft, a thin baguette would have been better.Overall I would say the Soft Shell Crab Po' Boy at Restoration is a must try.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-restoration/113559?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

Even at Itacho I can eat bigger sizes, more pieces, and tastier than here. 3) When it was time to pay the bill, we lined up as usual to pay at the cashier, and the cashier seeing that we were next in line, went ahead to the customers behind us.

At such a price, there were a lot more better choices in the same district at a cheaper price.', ""Quality sashimi;Funky decor;Pricey but good quality.Ronin:0It's common knowledge that the sashimi served over lunch are not as fresh as those served at night. That's the reason why I seldom order sushi or sashimi at new Japanese restaurants. But quite a number of Japanese friends have recommended Ronin so I decided to give it a go. 0I ordered their Assorted Sashimi Rice lunch set. It came after a short wait. It had scallops, hamachi, tai, ikura, prawns,salmon and tuna (Akami). Not bad for a lunch set:00 I have to confess that the presence of salmon worried me a little, especially when I'm paying $280 for this. It is relatively uncommon for a traditional/authentic Japanese restaurant to serve salmon sashimi. Most Japanese customers would complaint about it. Salmon is not very suitable for sashimi because of the risks of parasites. Some Japanese restaurants use salmon that had undergone a process of deep freezing to kill off parasites but it's still relatively uncommon. Fortunately, the general quality of the sashimi was good (including salmon). The scallops in particular were the most fresh. To my pleasant surprise, the akami, which is usually the acid test of the freshness of a restaurant's sashimi, was very decent too. The tai and prawns were decent too.Whether grated wasabi was used is another indication of the level of a Japanese restaurant. They used grated wasabi here. I appreciated the fact that sushi rice was used. The amount of vinegar was just right. I enjoyed my assorted seafood rice set. After having the red miso soup, steamed egg, seaweed and salad, the whole meal was filling enough for me.While some of my colleagues found the portion of their meal on the petite side in view of the price they were paying, they agreed that the quality of the food was good.000So the verdict is that the food quality was good and the restaurant did pay attention to details. I was happy with the meal even taking into account the price. A place worth bearing in mind if you are around the area. I might even try their dinner sometime.0""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-ronin-japanese-cuisine/470697?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

586,S.A.E.,Wan Chai,Japanese,4.2,75.0,0.0,"Yesterday was my girlfriends birthday so I brought her here for her birthday lunch. She is so addicted to Japanese food and I saw that it is quite recommended in openrice so I choose here. It is delighting that the food and service here is indeed of high quality and we had a very good time.I ordered assorted sushi platter, and she ordered diced sashimi on vinegar rice. Both lunch sets include steamed egg custard, steamed turnip with minced pork and dessert  a scoop of ice cream. The whole set is only HKD$70, which is quite a bargain in Wanchai, isnt it?diced sashimi on vinegar rice, with appetizers0diced sashimi on vinegar rice, with appetizersIt was quite surprising that the appetizers were so appealing and they indeed tasted amazing. The steamed egg custard is hot and smooth with lots of fresh ingredients inside so the texture is highly appreciated. I was quite afraid of the smelly taste of the eggs which I experienced before in some crappy restaurants. But this one has a rich fresh flavor of eggs and the soup soaked inside was delicious. The steamed turnip with minced pork is hot enough as well and tasted like the famous turnips in which is equally juicy. Using minced pork is indeed a creative way and the flavors were wonderfully mixed which makes the fushion successful.assorted sushi platter0assorted sushi platterdiced sashimi on vinegar rice - a close-up! well presented....0diced sashimi on vinegar rice - a close-up! well presented....The assorted sushi platter is so satisfying! The ones we ordered in sushi chain stores are always in twosomes so we always do not have the capacity to eat in a more diversified way (i.e. to try more different kinds of sushi). This platter has eight different kinds of sushi, one for each kind; which is much better. Let me introduce the sushi in a clockwise manner: The platter includes salmon, sea bass, snapper, vinegared mackerel, surf clams, shrimp, and cucumber crab meat rolls, with sea urchin in the centre. The sashimi is generally fresh. Her diced sashimi on vinegar rice is nicely presented as well, with the equally fresh sashimi on top and she said the portion is just right for her.It is also quite smart to use ice cream as dessert; it cools people down in this hot weather (although the environment there is comfy enough); It is also a light ending which rounds the whole meal up brilliantly.The staff there is very polite and always beamed when they greeted the customers, which reminds me of the Japanese local restaurants. I almost wanted to thanked them in return for the great moments we spent here.', ""Came here for lunch on a Wednesday. The place was never fully packed even though we were there at peak lunch hour, which is a surprise as the food here is good! Only problem is there's very few waiters. At one point, only one sleepy-looking waiter was serving the entire room of customers. Lunch sets here are a bit pricier than the typical Wan Chai lunch, ranging around $80, but worth it. It's got four courses after all: miso soup, steamed egg custard, entree and then dessert. Both starters were quite disappointing, however. The soup was too salty (even for me... and I'm the type to add soy sauce to rice) and the egg custard was pretty plain. The mushroom in the custard had almost no taste. Maybe this meshes well with the overly salty soup, but I would've preferred if some of that sodium from the soup went to the egg. Thankfully, the food after was a lot better! The tempura was crispy and even came with a side of fatty tuna (though the fatty tuna was a bit too hard to chew). My mistake, however, was not ordering the spicy tuna rice that my friends ordered. I had a taste of the fish and it was fresh - chewy but not elastic. I'm not a huge fan of sashimi, but the spiciness masked the rawness. Generous portions too - one of my big-eater friends couldn't even finish the whole thing! For dessert, I went with the western choice of black sesame ice cream. Sweet with a strong black sesame taste, and not too milky - it was very good in my opinion!This place wasn't the best Japanese cuisine I've had, but I look forward to getting the spicy tuna rice next time! black sesame ice cream 0black sesame ice cream assorted tempura0assorted tempurasteamed egg with mushroom0steamed egg with mushroom""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/wan-chai-s-a-e/11212?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

589,SAMA HK,Central,Japanese,3.9,105.0,0.0,"Been to SAMA at Gough St many many times. One of the reasons is the close proximity to work, primarily of course, is the food.They offer a selection of hokkaido style soup curry with a good mix of toppings plus a standard set of vegetable. The highlight is one gets to choose the level of spiciness for the curry, ranging from 1 to 30. Personally, i like to ENJOY a meal so i tend to choose a milder taste. For those whom think they cannot handle the spiciness, stick to a number below 5. As the staff always say, if it ends up not hot enough you can always spice things up but you cannot reverse it.Customers can choose to have rice, ramen or udon to go with the curry (rice is standard, the noodles at an extra cost). Topping-wise, my personal favourite is the patty. Pan fried, not over-cooked and generally taste good (it's a patty, not an A-grade steak what else can one ask for). Pork is not recommended, the cut they use has way too much fat attached. Chicken and seafood are decent choices as well.SAMA is one of my favourite lunch places. I take friends there, challenge them to eat level 30, no one has fell for it so far...It is not situated at an eye catching spot, accommodates around 20 people.

We tried baby bear which was not spicy at all, big like big like! We have to highlight the soup base. The soup base is shipped directly from Sapporo, Japan. It is not cooked in Hong Kong like some of other restaurants do. The soup was slightly thickened and rich in tomato flavour with the blended tomato bits in it, which makes it easy to go down by just drinking it. The soup went super well with the warm Japanese rice. Traditionally, we should dip the rice into the soup, rather than pouring the soup over the rice. You may also have complimentary additional rice you think the rice is not enough for you!! Good news for big appetites! p.s. we have also tried the adult bear spicy level 15, it was already spicy enough to make us sweat!

It was similar to the normal fruity type of Japanese curry with a bit of a kick. The prawn taste was not extremely pronounced (don\'t expect it to be like the prawn broths in Torimen or Singaporean prawn noodles) but there was still a lovely, mild aftertaste which added some complexity to the curry broth.The vegetables were fresh and crunchy. I believe those were imported from Japan. The chicken thigh was big and tender with decent chicken taste.Some of us had udon. The udon looked a bit strange to me but my friends liked it. I suggest that they serve the udon (and the rice) in a bowl instead of on a plate. That makes it easier to put the contents into the soup curry.I choose rice. The rice could have been less watery but it was still not bad. I enjoyed mixing the rice into the soup curry.The tempura($30) on the other hand was not good. The batter was too thick and oily.

591,SUSHI SASE,Central,Japanese,1.5,500.0,3.0,"After hearing some good reviews about this restaurant, decided to pop in for lunch with a few friends. The interior primarily consists of a classic japanese wooden interior, with a majority of the floorspace dedicated to a large sushi counter. There is also a smaller room with a small sushi counter that seats maybe 5 people as well as 3 individual tables that seat 4. The spacing of the restaurant is very well designed. However, when I sat down on my table (the 4 seater), I noted that the table was still wet so had to notify the water to dry it. If i remember correctly, there are 6 sets to choose from (omakase, Hokkaido set, sushi set, deluxe sushi set...and 2 others). I opted for the Hokkaido set, which includes steamed egg, uni/salmon roe rice, 6 pieces of sushi and udon. The steamed egg was velvety and very smooth, with a small piece of mushroom inside, slightly seasoned for taste. However, the uni/salmon roe rice was relatively dissappointing as the salmon roe was not very fresh and didn't have the briny flavor you usually get from other comparable restaurants. The uni itself was ok but I expected it to be a better grade as it wasn't as smooth. The sushi was the biggest dissappointment in terms of freshness, with one of the pieces emitting a very strong fishy smell, which I did not expect from such a reputable establishment. The udon was average although slightly overcooked. The meal in itself was $500, and at this price, I will probably visit other similar establishments in the Central area for better grade sushi...at least during lunchtime.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-sushi-sase/47958?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw
592,SUSHI SEI,Central,Japanese,4.0,458.3,10.0,"Sushi Sei is a convenient place for lunch in IFC Mall, and it is easy to find seats. The food has decent quality, but is rather expensive. I ordered the Deluxe Edomae Nigiri Sushi lunch set. It contains 12 pieces of sushi, including toro and uni. The quality is decent, the fish is reasonably fresh. However, for this price -  $450+10%, there are a lot more better options in Central. (See my other reviews.)Deluxe edomae nigiri sushi set$ 4950Deluxe edomae nigiri sushi set$ 495', ""This is one of my fav place for daily lunch in IFC. There are not too many Japanese restaurants for lunch around IFC for daily base. Dining at Inagiku or other high end Japanese restaurants for lunch is not an everyday option. At the same time I am not a fan of Sen Ryo or similar stuff. Sushi Sei is a good option for daily lunch. My favorite set is the Vegetable Tempura set which includes salad, 5 kinds of vegetable tempura, simmered tofu with mushroom, steamed rice, miso soup and dessert. It includes so many stuff and only for 250, such a great deal for lunch. I ordered something different today, which is the noodle set. 0As always I had the salad first. 0Then the cold tokushima handa somen noodle with soft boiled egg.  It's tasty and good for this hot weather.  0Mini grilled eel on rice. Both the quality and the quantity are good.  Worth 250 and I felt so full after finish them. In summary I don't recommend this place for dinner but I do recommend it for lunch, especially those lunch set, worth the price."", ""You can have an amazing lunch at Sushi Sei but you'll pay for it. Definitely a spot worthy of your expense account though. The diced tuna and scallion over rice is everything. The seaweed salad is super authentic (nothing slimy or neon green here) and the California rolls are made with real crab which is incredible to see as an American! The spinach is beautifully constructed but nothing special taste wise. 00""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-sushi-sei/439468?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
593,Sagrantino,Central,Italian,3.3,141.8,2.0,"A friend recommended this place for lunch. Lunch sets (Salad/soup + pasta + coffee/tea/soft drink) were offered at a price of around $128 + 10% if I remembered correctly. There were many choices of different kinds of pasta in the lunch set, even cold pastaI ordered salad + spaghetti with diced salmon in creamy sauce + hot lemon water.Salad was just one kinda vegetables with loads of salad dressing and some cheese mixed with the dressing. It would have been much better if there was more variety of vegetables with less dressing.The portion of the spaghetti was ok and there were much more sauce than required to finish every single spaghetti with plentiful sauce. The diced salmon was cooked just about right. The amount of diced salmon was just enough. Many of my friends ordered pasta with prawn and the serving of the prawn seemed to be bigger than that of diced salmon. I also tried some of their prawns which were perfectly cooked and made me feel like eating prawn sashimi.Overall, I think food was nice but slightly pricey which probably explained the pretty empty restaurant even during lunch hour on a working day. Maybe they could improve their salad/soup a bit to justify the price. Service was ok with attentive staff.', ""Service was good.  my friends and i got to sit in a private corner in the restaurant so we could chat freely.  we ordered 3 lunch sets to share.the parmaham pizza was very delicious and crunchy. cooked to the right level.the mushroom risotto was so so, very average and a bit too salty.i was quite disappointed with the salmon cold pasta.  i've tried it many times and this  was the first time it didnt deliver.  the salmon was not fresh and tasted old and rank. there was no wasabi provided.billed at $420 for 3 ppl, didnt finish everything.hope it gets its cold pastas back up to standard!"", 'lunch00000', 'I came here with two of my colleagues, and one of them had brought along her daughter. We were four and booked in advance for 1pm.When we came at 12.50, the staff assisting us seemed to be rather offended that we came early despite the fact that the restaurant was pretty empty for Central\'s busy lunch hour.The lunch menu was $125 and one could choose from a big range of pastas. The lunch sets with meat as the main thing cost $165. Alternatively, we could choose from any of the risotto dishes for $132. Since I had the feeling that my colleague would settle the bill, I went for a Porcini risotto even though I was desperately avoiding unhealthy meals that consisted of 99% carbs.The lunch set could go with soup or salad, and I chose the salad. It\'s a very small portion with caesar dressing and lettuce, but nothing else. Not even a trace of parmesan. Very convenient for cost cutting and operational efficiency. That being said, the caesar dressing was alright, but not better than Pret\'s.The porcini risotto came soaked in a bath of porcini ""soup"". The rice was less soggy than I initially imagined based on how it looked, but there was really nothing but porcini water and rice. It smelled good, as porcini always does, but I would have hoped to see more mushroom and porcini (none to be seen--just porcini water). I ate about half and gave up.Then finally the hot coffee came. Not much comment on that. Service overall was alright, but will not return because for pure carbs $150 was simply not reasonable.', 'Didn\'t book in advance, as some people evidently did. Nevertheless they were able to serve us at approximately 1 pm, and I am thankful for that. Come for a simple lunch, or when you itch for pasta - the staple comfort food that cheers up the soul.DecorIf you\'ve been to any of the many restaurants in The Loop you would have a sense of what Sagrantino looks like. A long corridor with tables on either side, and then a slightly bigger area at the back. Sagrantino emulates a casual Italian-Asian vibe, nothing that gets you worked up or anxious about protocol.FoodI have not had the chance to sample their a la carte menu items yet, but having had a brief look at their menu I would want to try for example the Avocadonara pasta, or the squid ink risotto. (On that note please do correct the spelling mistake of ""rissoto"" at the entrance).We tried their lunch menus, and contrary to what my fellow reviewers said the portions are certainly sufficient. It may be that if you ordered the ""grill"" items you would leave half-full, but with pasta, good old dependable pasta, they serve you just the right amount.The soup we had, potato soup, was just alright. Not an expert on this so am just mentioning it in passing.Pollo - chicken heart and kidney in cream sauce - Yumm...0Pollo - chicken heart and kidney in cream sauce - Yumm...Pollo (chicken heart, [liver] and kidney)I\'m not a squeamish person for organs, if you are, don\'t read this paragraph. Organs have been used in European cuisines for a variety of dishes, yes, the ""civilized cultures"" eat them too. I\'ve had calf liver, whole, grilled or seasoned somehow in Edinburgh (though even I can\'t finish it, just too much!). Chinese of course, love organs. I\'ve never had pasta with the organs in such wholesome pieces though. In my opinion, the penne with creamy, cheesy sauce is just nicely complemented by chewy and flavourful organ morsels. Rated 7.6/10.Salsiccia - with Italian sausage and red wine sauce - Interesting...0Salsiccia - with Italian sausage and red wine sauce - Interesting...Salsiccia (Italian sausage and red wine sauce)What\'s striking about this pasta sauce is that it does taste strongly of red wine minus the alcohol. Interesting take on a red, tomato base sauce. Didn\'t sample the sausage can\'t comment on that. Rated 7.5/10.Generally, their pasta needs an additional dash of cheese, and only if they automatically served the grated Parmesan along with the pasta.The drinks that come along with the lunch set are BLEH.ConclusionAs titled, this is a good place to come for comfort food, and where you have a limited lunch hour. Not bad for its value too, a pasta lunch set costs $118 with 10%.

595,Sakana No Aji,Central,Japanese,4.2,377.5,0.0,"Summary: the taste of fish indeed- tremendous value for an omakase sushi lunch. If youve never had a serious sushi meal, this is the place to start. Wonderful sushi chefs who cater to clients while maintaining balance and variety in their menu. Highly recommended (for lunch at least!)My friend had been building this place up for me for weeks  a proper omakase sushi meal for under HKD 500? Seems too good to be true even for lunch.Located on Lyndhurst Terrace above Lee Lo Mei, at first glance its another decent Japanese restaurant in a city full of them. Among its tables however is an 8-10 seat sushi counter which should be far more prominent.Heres the lunch menu  look at the variety!Lunch menu2Lunch menu I cant speak for the other sets, but I cant imagine they compare with the sushi omakase. Anyway, as my friend had been there before, the sushi chef prepared our toppings according to what he thought shed like. It was about only about 60% the same as the couple next to us who also ordered the omakase i.e. the sets are quite customized. I was impressed by the variety and balance of white/red/shining fish/others in just a 10-piece set.Heres what we hadFlounder (Hirame) one of my personal favourites, flounder subtly oozes umami, though this one was a relatively bland still enjoyableOctopus  prepared with yuzu and salt  light, chewy and refreshingSayori (Halfbeak)  great shining fish sushi, but I prefer the fishier varieties hohohoAkagai  great texture but missing some characteristic ocean flavor (perhaps not from Japan?)Kuruma ebi  my favorite piece of the meal  massive Japanese shrimp half-boiled so you get the chewiness of raw shrimp with the sweetness of cooked shrimp. Delicious0Kanpachi (amberjack) excellent as usualKinki (Channel Rockfish)  seared with a blowtorch (aburi) with a piece of its own liver, its incredibly decadent and rich. Id never tried this before0Otoro  I try to hate it but you cant deny its deliciousUni  massive helping and wonderfully ocean-y and sweetEngawa (flounder fin) marinated in homemade garlic soy sauce and flame broiled, served wrapped with nori. Its as delicious as it looks but I thought the marination was a bit too strong (kinda salty), though the nori helped to balance it out0Negitoro hand roll  I almost look forward to the end of the omakase so I get my negitoro hand roll  this one did not disappoint  diced toro, leeks and takuan pickles mixed with sesame and wrapped in seaweed. Perfectly balanced and the pickles really work, both for the crunch and the subtle tartness0Along with the sushi you get an excellent chawanmushi, a pretty typical salad and miso soup, and warabimochi for dessert.I usually dont review lunch meals because I think dinner is a truer expression of a restaurant (for better or worse), but this was too good not to advertise. If you enjoy sushi but dont want to pay 1k for a meal, make it a point to treat yourself to Sakana no Ajis omakase lunch.', ""To be honest, I wouldn't have visited this place if simply considering its name. Because its name reminded me of another modern Chinese restaurant in the same building charging food at a premium for its creativity of the interior decorations and names only while the portion of the food was so tiny. However, we decided to give it a try as there was omakase sushi lunch sets at quite an economical price.We asked for seats at the sushi counter so that we could enjoy omakase sushi the best. I had made the reservation with a discount offered by the openrice and there was some confusion when I double confirmed with the staff while checking in so that our lunch experience didn't start off so smoothly. Anyway, I cared more about the quality of the food.1We both ordered Nigiri sushi (8 pieces) with udon. It seemed that prices had already inflated compared with those mentioned at recent comments on openrice. Maybe the promotion season was over.Small Side Dish & Salad1Small Side Dish & SaladThe small side dish with small fishes tasted quite good. They were not salty at all. The salad was normal.Steamed Egg0Steamed EggThe steamed egg was not hot but pretty smooth with quite a lot of ingredients like chicken, mushroom, prawn, etc. It was quite good.Pickled ginger slices0Pickled ginger slicesThe chef who served us was from HK and he was quite attentive to us (as we arrived so early so he basically just served us). The pickled ginger slices were quite disappointing as the quality was just like those at Genki Sushi, really nothing compared with those served at professional sushi bars. Anyway the chef kept refilling for us as we had a habit of eating one to two slices of pickled ginger before trying the next sushi.Sushi 1: 1Sushi 1: The chef sprinkled some seasoning on top. There was also some jelly on top of the sushi. It was ok. But I think they didn't add much soy sauce to the sushi in general so I found them a bit too plain. I had expected that I didn't have to add any other seasoning to the sushi after being tailor made by the chef.Sushi 2: 0Sushi 2: A very common sushi. Nothing special to talk about.Sushi 3: 0Sushi 3: It was so thick and meaty with strong yuzu and lemon juice. The texture was so good and it was so fresh, although I personally didn't fancy such a strong yuzu and lemon flavour.Sushi 4:  with caviar0Sushi 4:  with caviarI actually tried 1 caviar first and the caviar was tasteless! The shrimp itself was good and had my favourite sticky texture.Sushi 5: Toro1Sushi 5: ToroIt was not very fatty but it was ok given the price.Miso Soup0Miso SoupThe miso soup was served pretty hot. A pass!Sushi 6: Uni0Sushi 6: UniThe uni was fresh. But the seaweed could have been more crispy.Sushi 7: 0Sushi 7: It was grilled and it was quite fatty. Ok.Sushi 8: 0Sushi 8: The chef introduced to us that there were sesame,  and  added to the sushi. However, it was a bit tasteless despite the many ingredients.Egg0EggIt was quite cold and sticky. It was ok.Udon0UdonThe udon was ok. I did feel full after finishing all despite the small size and number of sushi!0The dessert was the worst thing of the meal. The  syrup on top was too sweet. I had expected just a simple ice-cream scoop. It was really disappointing.Overall, I would say the quality of the sushi was better than I had expected from the price especially given the location in Central. I even enjoyed an early bird 15% discount which made it an even better deal. Definitely no harm to try given such a price. Having said that, there seemed to be a big gap with other better sushi bars in terms of quality in the same district. So they really had to improve the quality of their food if they were going to raise their prices.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-sakana-no-aji/561462?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

I had to admit that they were pretty bad. They were all well-prepared in advance and they were so thick cut and not particularly yummy. In fact I found them a bit too spicy.

I actually tried to search for more information on the website about this sashimi but couldn't find much. It was really a bit chewy although I couldn't recall much about the taste afterwards except for the seaweed. The sushi rice was well seasoned although there could have been slightly more wasabi.0 almost always appeared as one of the first few sushis of such sushi set.

It was really refreshing with the lime and yuzu juices added.0I found this one taste a bit like red tuna although my lunch partner didn't agree. It was not particularly pleasing.0Then we waited for a long long time before our next sushi arrived because the chef was very busy preparing the omakase sets for others. It was quite pleasant watching the chef prepare food but unfortunately we still had to work after lunch!  had the typical sticky prawn sashimi texture which I really liked. The  was ok although I don't like it normally as it is usually too salty. Having said that, I think the quality of the prawn could have been much better, especially at this price.0 with salad dressing was served to us for free maybe as an apology for having kept us waiting. It was really appreciated. The  was very crispy and went well with the salad dressing. Although again we had to wait for quite a long while before our next sushi was served.0Starting from this sushi, the sushi rice started to fall apart when I tried to take it from the sushi plate to my own plate using chopsticks. I suspected that it was all because the chef was in a rush.0It was not fatty nor salty so I wondered why they served this in such an order? It was a bit too plain to me actually. By that time I had already asked for faster serving of sushi because we had to go soon so all the remaining sushi sort of rushed in. The chef did apologize to us.Toro0ToroToro was good as always but it was not the fattiest of all.0This one really melted in my mouth and it was so fatty!Uni0UniThe uni was quite fresh. For some reason, it was better when eaten with the whole thing in my mouth compared with just trying 1 slice of uni from the top.Udon0UdonWe had a choice of either miso soup or udon and we both went for the udon. The udon was a bit disappointing given the class of such a sushi restaurant because they could have been much smoother. The soup was ok as it tasted quite good.Black Sesame ice-cream0Black Sesame ice-creamWe had a choice of coffee or ice-cream and of course we went for the ice-cream. The quality of ice-cream was quite good.Although my stomach was quite big, I did feel full after finishing everything from the set.Overall, I would say the quality of the sushi was ok although more special sushi could have been served given the price. Moreover, I was really a bit disappointed by the sushi rice towards the end of the meal. At such a price, I think I would rather top up a little bit to go to those better sushi bars in the same district.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-sakura-japanese-cuisine/566794?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

It'sinterestingto see the tactful chef performs his skill while tasting the meal. It's not just about the food, it's also joyful for the whole process. Have been to here twice already!Ok, let's talk about the now...The soup: Pumpkin Soup- very creamy and tasted really nice!The salad and bread- though the salad without not much dressing, could taste the freshness of the vegetables. The bread was so yummy, you can have more if you want! The scallop- This impressed me the most! The scallop was so thick and the chef cooked it just right. Not too raw but wouldn't be overcooked as well! The main: The Black Sole (1st visit)- Though the fish with bones (not small bones), it's not difficult to handle ;) andcould taste the sweetnessof the fish and matchedwell with the sauce. The Horsehead fish (2nd visit)-Different kind of fish with different cooking method. It's light with soup and loved the crispy fish skin. Very nice presentation as well!The Lobster (friend's choice)- She likedit very much, especially the sauce. They mentioned that the sauce is made by lobster shell...no wonder!The rice: garlic rice and miso soup- The rice looked ordinary but the texture shows the skill of the chef. It wasn't oily and the rice was so chewy! The taste of miso soup tells the class of the restaurant. This one definitely was thenice ones.Dessert: Ice-cream- I have tried caramel and vanilla.

I really enjoyed this dish as the broth was sweet and came out steaming. This dish also included a bowl of Japanese steamed rice. Tasted very similar to Sukiyaki that I had in Japan. Udon with hotpot$ 980Udon with hotpot$ 98udon with hotpot$ 980udon with hotpot$ 98I really enjoyed the udon noodle in this dish. The texture and appearance is similar to the hand drawn udon you get in Japan. It is not too thick, smooth and has slight bounce to the chewiness. As can be seen in the photos fillings are generous in the hotpot! The fried strip under the sprouts is a tempera prawn  The vegetables in both Sukiyaki and udon hotpot were very fresh and absorbed the flavour of the soup, making them very tasty.0The restaurant is on basement level and easily accessible from B exit of cwb station. 0Overall we spent around $340 for everything. This is not bad considering we had two full sized hotpots, rice, and four sushi. The portions were big enough to keep us full for the rest of the day', 'This place is near Sogo and must go restaurant in Causeway Bay. The decoration makes you feel like you are in Japan...wooden bamboo theme with posters and flags, it gives you a warm chilling place for weekend lunch.00000 Cold noodles $920My first impression when the waiter placed the cold noodles on the table was wow ! The portion is large compare to other Japanese restaurants. Generous portion of ingredients (crab stick, sliced cucumber, veggie, sliced ham, sliced egg and chicken bits) and noodles. Firstly, the sauce is so delicious, sweet and sour flavour. After the first bite, you will feel even more hungry ! The sauce opens up your appetite and we finished the noodle in no time. Noodle texture is chewy. This is one of the best cold noodles I ever ate because of the sufficient ingredients, each bite of the noodles is covered with the ingredients and sauce . Balloon fish $780I love to eat balloon fish and this is a must order dish when I eat in a Japanese restaurant. Again, the portion is generous and we wont be digging our chopsticks fighting to have a slice. The balloon fish was grilled nicely, it is thick and juicy.  A Dream Come True $148A Dream Come True$ 1480A Dream Come True$ 148Name of the dish attracted me to order and the picture speaks all the words. Why is it dream come true...well, we tend to get greedy when it comes to sushi and hoping to find a sushi that includes everything we like to eat. I found my sushi in here! Sea uni, minced tuna and crab meat all in one-go! Presentation of the dish is pretty. Ingredients is fresh and sweet; portion is generous too.', ""I wanted to try a new restaurant for lunch before heading to work and I came across Sansen Japanese Bar and Restaurant.

It was drenched in a salad dressing.0There was still a lot of left over after I finished my salad.0The miso soup was just diluted miso with a few pieces of tofu and nori. I don't even think they used dashi?0The cold soba was over cooked. I've never actually had over cooked soba before but here it was! Soggy and limp. It broke up when I tried to pick it up. It was also still dripping with water! The dipping sauce was just salty soy sauce.0The sushi was not even fresh. The rice was mushy. The fish had a strange slime like feel to it. I didn't touch it.

601,Sawadika,Wan Chai,Thai,4.1,50.0,0.0,"OK, so this is a review of my lunch visit today, but in the spirit of richness, choice and variety I have decided to also tip my cap towards other dishes that I have eaten at this restaurant, as it is a lunchtime staple, which I visit at least every other week.Greeted, as always it seems, by Steven (or it could be Stephen, we aren\'t that close) the boss at the door we are shown to a spare table and we set about choosing. This is one of those great little places where everything is on a well set out sheet of paper, you tick the box for what you want, hold it in the air and lickety-split the food arrives. Today I went away from my usual (which will get a well earned mention soon) and tried some soup noodles. From a choice of 4 or 5 soup bases I went for the duck soup (insert Marx Brothers quote here), Phnom Penh noodles and fish balls and sliced pork. Sadly there was a translation issue, and what in English read \'sliced pork\' actually meant \'minced pork\'. Oh well, no major problem. The duck soup was deep and rich in both colour and flavour. I could have gladly sat down and devoured a bowl of just the broth without addition of noodles, vegetables, bean sprouts or meat/fish. That having been said, these did enhance the meal of course and created a tasty, beautifully aromatic yet simple bowl of Thai influenced soup noodles. Soup and noodles came to $31 and the pork and fish balls were an additional $6 per. For those of you who prefer to eat food instead of doing basic maths, that came to $43.My colleague went for the yellow curry soup base, which was lightly spiced, but not too serious for a lunch. Both of us chose iced lemongrass for our drink (add $8). This is a favourite of mine. The slightly floral resiny quality of the lemongrass comes through and is cut with not too much sweetness. This is available hot too, but why would you?My usual \'go to\' dish at Sawadika is the Lemongrass Pork Neck Yellow Curry. If you have a soul somewhere in your body and a tongue in your mouth, you will like this (unless you don\'t care for yellow curry, or for religious purposes don\'t eat pork, in either case I would recommend not ordering this dish). The curry is rich and creamy, the sauce is thinner than I usually experience in Thailand, but this is no bad thing, as you get a very generous portion of steamed rice that benefits from the extra curry. The pork neck is seemingly grilled and then added to the sauce, imparting an extra dimension to the flavour profile. That is basically it......apart from the potatoes. Now I know that potatoes in curries is as devisive a subject as ""Who was to blame for the global financial crisis?\' and \'Ketchup or brown sauce on a fried egg sandwich? But from my humble soap box, potatoes in curries are simply a must, especially when they are as magnificently gentrified as they are here. They must first cook them in ambrosia (Nectar of the gods, not rice pudding) before adding them to the finished curry as they are some of the best potatoes I have ever eaten. Do it, try them, tell me I\'m wrong I dare you.Sawadika is a lovely, friendly hole in the wall that seldom disappoints, and even if it does, let Steven know, he cares, and he wants to serve good food to everyone. Let him serve some to you one day, you\'ll thank him for it.'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/wan-chai-sawadika/174070?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

The restaurant is quite small, but it's quite easy to find with its neon pink and green sign.1I knew I wanted to try the portobello mushroom after reading the magazine article, but that's not quite enough for lunch, so I decided to try the Special Salad Combo as well. So, I placed my order at the counter and picked out 3 choices from the salad showcase up front.111After taking my order, the server asked me to take a seat while they prepared my order. As Selfit is a small restaurant, there's only 1 table along with a few bar seats available.

The tuna pasta had just the right amount of dressing, and the pasta was the right texture without being too mushy! The purple sweet potato was delightful; it had the natural sweetness of the sweet potato and pumpkin, and the apple pieces gave it a light acidity. The kale salad came with a dressing on the side, which was a light vinaigrette. Kale is bitter by nature, and the dressing had the right amount of sweetness and acidity to balance out the bitterness of the kale!Portobello with Chicken and Kimchi Cheese Sauce$ 381Portobello with Chicken and Kimchi Cheese Sauce$ 38Portobello with Chicken and Kimchi Cheese Sauce$ 381Portobello with Chicken and Kimchi Cheese Sauce$ 38Portobello with Chicken and Kimchi Cheese Sauce: The kimchi cheese sauce was a little too spicy for me, but there was also bbq sauce on the mushroom, so that balanced out the heat a little!

It seemed to be geared for take away.0They had a lunch menu that changes weekly that consists of pasta and comes with a drink with an optional soup or yogurt upgrade. Sounded healthy and quick enough, I decided to eat here.0Ordered the Italian spicy tomato sauce with prawn pasta for $68. Pastas are made to order so I waited a while for them to make it. It was piping hot when it arrived. The pasta was not very spicy with a decent tomato sauce. Pasta was not overcooked though not al dente. The prawns were actually the best. Fresh and firm. I liked the prawns a lot.0Lunch comes with a drink but for ice drinks, there is an additional $4. I asked for an ice lemon tea. This came in the cutest mug ever.0As I didn't want soup, I ordered a salad. Salads are $48 and you can choose up to three choices from their display. I chose a sweet potato and pumpkin salad and tomato prawn salad with pesto. I actually liked the salad a lot more than the pasta. The potato and pumpkins were nice and creamy, just the way I like potatoes. The combination made for one sweet tasting salad. I found this was tossed with some raisins. Love raisins so this was a good combination for me. The tomato prawn salad with pesto tasted very fresh. There was a generous serving of pesto.

However, the other dishes were generally subpar in terms of flavor and/or skill. Stir-fried sticky rice was OK but quite soggy, not the characteristics one would expect if it was ""raw fried"" as claimed (meaning that the grains of rice were cooked from start to finish in the wok by stir frying resulting in the more coveted al dente finish rather than a soggy sticky mess that sticky rice is prone to). The last dish, and the one that drove the nail to the coffin of a bad review was the vermecelli dish. At $90, it featured fish and gai lan and was supposed to be stewed. We didn\'t expect much, perhaps a bit of fish filets tossed in some consomm and a couple gai lan stalks (the normal way to do any type of ""stewed"" noodle dish), but what we got was some pale looking noodles that was merely tossed in oil with some pieces of minced fish paste and a couple pieces of sad looking gai lan.

The vegetables included baby bok choy, Chinese lettuce, enoki mushrooms and shimeji mushrooms. The vegetables were fresh and clean. The meat was excellent quality. The chuck rib was a thick cut and just melt in your mouth fabulous.0I chose udon instead of rice. Thus, I received no pickles. The udon was nice.

It wasn't too spicy and tasted a bit like the sweet and spicy sauce you find in Thai restaurants.0The pork chop was served on the side instead of on top of the rice like usual. This was pretty good as it ensured the pork chop would maintain it's crispiness. There was also a side of salad which was ok.0Pork chop was moist and not dried out. The amount of coating was thin and crispy.0Everything was good until I had the rice. The egg and onion layer was pretty good. But the rice was mushy and overcooked.

Knowing that it might be the last time to visit, we ordered everything we wanted in one go. Shack burger (double) - cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato, shacksauceAlways loved brioche buns for the fluffiness and buttery sweet flavour that go well with any ingredients. The beef patty was thick, juicy and slightly seasoned, with melted cheese clinging to it. The vegetables were fresh and crisp too but the shacksauce didnt really stand out. Not bad but not something unforgettable. Shroom burger - Deep fried portobello mushroom filled with muenster and cheddar cheese, topped with lettuce, tomato, shacksauceThis one was a must-try! The crispy and slightly chewy portobello mushroom with oozing cheese was the most satisfying ever! The vegetables balanced out the fattiness and saltiness of the cheese and all of these made a burger in heaven! Hamburger with lettuce, tomato and onionsTheir hamburger was rather ordinary without the shacksauce and cheese. Not that its not yummy but probably more for people who like it simple. Cheese friesI prefer crunchy and thick cut fries so Shake Shacks version easily ticked my boxes, only if the fries were slightly more seasoned. The cheese sauce was alright but didnt lift the flavours too much. Finish this quickly or else the fries will get soggy. Coffee shakeWoah this is the shake I am talking about! Thick, creamy and full of coffee aroma from the first sip! Get this if you are a coffee lover. Milk tea shake A flavour only offered in Hong Kong stores so I had high expectations. Sadly, the milk tea flavour resembles that of English milk tea instead of the Hong Kong version. It was a little too sweet for my liking too. Iced teaI thought this would be some kind of sweetened lemon or peach iced tea but it was literally an iced tea. It was still refreshing but could be bland when eaten with burgers and fries. If Im visiting for a second time, Im going for their fifty/fifty (a mix of lemonade and iced tea).0000', ""I had never thought about trying Shake Shack as this idea had been put off by the very very long queue, until a friend asked me to try as she said the line didn't seem as scary as before.It took us about 20 min to get our food during lunch hour on a week day and it was not so hard to find seats for 2 persons. We even managed to grab 2 indoor seats.Hamburger (Single)$ 380Hamburger (Single)$ 38Hamburger (Single)$ 380Hamburger (Single)$ 38I was not hungry so just ordered a hamburger with tomatoes, onions, pickles and lettuce to try. Sorry that the lettuce had basically covered up all the ingredients. The portion was larger than expected. The bread had a great texture which was slightly crispy outside but soft inside. The patty was quite juicy and thick. The whole thing didn't seem so oily with the plentiful vegetables. There was quite a generous amount of vegetables in the hamburger except for lettuce which was just a slice. Tomatoes, onions and pickles were at least 2 slices each.I tried one of the cheese fries my friend ordered. It was not particularly hot or tasted like freshly deep fried and I was a bit disappointed.Overall, I was quite pleased with the hamburger and may come back to try other food later .By the way, I was so surprised by their hand washing machine which automatically dispensed hand soap, then water, then even paper to dry your hands!"", 'On this wintry Sunday morning, a sudden spur of excitement motivated us to revisit Shake Shack for the second time.  While we were on our way to the restaurant, we were making back up plans if the line up was too long.Surprisingly, they have newly integrated a special line up called the ""C-Line."" It is an express line for ordering beverages, such as, beer and milkshakes. In addition, this line also serves as a special line for any ladies who are pregnant. As my wife is pregnant, we get to order right away. Anyhow, based on my observations today. the ordering line is much shorter than before. The line up did not go all the way to the patio.Today I have tried another milkshake from their menu. It is their Hong Kong Special, Milktea Milkshake. It taste great, but I find it a bit too sweet. The burger I had today is, once again, the Smoke Burger, while my wife had the regular Shack Burger. However, they do not taste as good as the ones I hadon the very first time. The burger was oily.  Really oily indeed.  The bread is soaked, the paper wrapping is obviously saturated with oil. It wasnt a great experience definitely but I would say its acceptable.  0', 'late post we went here in the weekends so long queue is expected but waiting for 30 minutes, that took us so long. anyhow that time people wanted to try it for the first time cause it was newly open. we ordered a regular burger , with a nice view the price is ok. and taste?pretty much nothing interesting about it or soemthimg new,for me same old buger. but it taste goodstill a thumbs up!00000010', ""We went to Shake Shack, because my HK local friends have never tried it before.Quality and tastes is the same as the New York one. But even in NY I felt Shake Shack is overrated.The burgers are small, meat quality is so so, and I can tastes the cheese is made with oil and not 100% milk.Butcher's Club is much better alternative, with higher quality meat and adult sized portions.My local friend say it's better then McDonalds, I would agree with that, but it's hardly a good burger stillI would however recommend the hotdogs and the icecream floats.Also their crinkle cut fries are good.Supplementary Informationexpected disappointment""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-shake-shack/568104?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

Hygiene needs to be improved.', ""Maybe i'm bias, but who's doesn't like a great burger.But this place was definitely one of the best burgers I have tried.The location of the store wasn't too far from Central MTR station, like a 5 mins walk. But it was a hot sunny Saturday afternoon, we were desperate for some food and a cool beverage.It was all uphill on Wellington Road, and the restaurant was above a 7-11 at the corner. It was a small shop, with the entrance at the side. As soon as we enter the restaurant, the cashier was right in front of us and with only 1 big bar that also serves food and small amount of seating area around.000Good thing that it's got the name of the store right on top of the fridge which as right behind the cashier.0Menu was basically a one big page, but the items on the menu was a little hard to read cause of the font style.

Thats why we started with fried onion rings and then a burger set (mushroom burger + chilli cheesy fries + soda).The onion ring is okay, nothing too bad, nothing too spectacular neither. The portion is proportional to its price so I would say its optional if you just want to add some different taste to your burger menu.As for the burger (sorry for not taking pictures) my bf said the beef patty is juicy and the garlic mayo is great...the bread is toasted too...but he wished the beef patty is a bit bigger (its not a fair comment tho as he ALWAYS has the ""American portion"" standard).And here comes the long-waited cheesy fries...good as expected!  The fries are freshly made and the cheese are all melted, covering the fries with chilli sauce.Conclusion: will come again, but may try something new like fish burger0', 'After my not so good experience at GBU, I did not expect much from this groupon at first.Had a big breakfast and decided to get a takeout burger for a late afternoon lunch.I went at 1:30pm and pre-ordereda South of the Border burger with combofor 2pm pickup - groupon use is from 2pm onward.Came back a bit earlier than 2pmand the burger was almost ready and the staff was very friendly and didn\'t give me black face at all for using my deal ""a few minutes early"".The fries and burger were packed in a brown bag and once I opened it in office, the smell filled the whole office  fries0friesSouth of the Border Burger0South of the Border BurgerThe burger did not look as big as I thought as first, just meat and the 3 standard sauces for Mexican food on top of the beef patty.

With the right amount ofsalsa sour cream and guacamole, the mixblended in well with the burger. For the fries, they are just perfect, fresh and crispy with a soft centre.Well done Shake-em Buns. I will consider coming back without any groupon.', ""I came here today for a quick lunch before heading back to work. The area is quite secluded, but the sign hanging outside was quite large and I was able to find my way there with no problems at all. The restaurant itself is quite small with only three tables for groups and two bar tables.When ordering my burger, the man behind the counter was very nice and asked what I wanted, if I wanted a combo, etc. with a good attitude and a pleasing demeanor - I was quite impressed as I wasn't expecting that at a burger joint. I ordered the Guitar Shop Special, just the burger, since I am only one small person and I didn't want to be overwhelmed with food. Guitar Shop Special ($65)Wow. This burger was really hard to put in my mouth as it was such a thick size! The burger was almost overflowing (that's a good thing) from all of the ingredients stuffed inside. The bun was toasted, but slightly soft when it came to me. The burger was very thick; a bit too well done, but still extremely beefy and juicy. The onions and mushroom gave a great caramelized, smokey flavor whilst the cheese gave a slight tang. I would have preferred slightly more cheese on my burger, though.Overall, the burger was really great, although there are some minor improvements that could be made to it. The service was slightly slow considering the lack of customers in the restaurant but also very nice. The price is quite high, but quality is also great. I would come back again!"", ""I love the concept of this burger shack, I really do, you've got your risque burger names laced with innuendo and tongue in cheek signage adorning the walls. As for the burgers themselves - not so much. Neither did I fancy the less than friendly attitude by the female waitstaff taking my order, who kind of glared at me when I placed my order. I had the cheeseburger combo (I was not about to pronounce that silly name they have on the menu for it) and apparently, it's now at a heavily discounted price of $52 for the combo which includes some very average fries of the skinless, machine generated frozen variety and a can of pop. I was also aggrieved by the fact that the cashier did not allow me to select cherry Coke, claiming that such was not allowed. It puzzles me since I thought all pop were created equal. Anyways, I did appreciate the quaint decor for this place, I found the wooden pub theme soothing with its dark walls and cramped booths overlooking Wellington street below. Now onto the burger, visually, it was stunning and beautiful to look at with an inch thick patty between vibrant veggies of tomato and lettuce. Gastronomically, not so much. My biggest gripe had been the patty which was to be honest, a little gross, it was soft and mushy with a texture akin to that of a soggy meatloaf, and not that of a tight patty. The problem seems to be from the overload of onions they had inserted into their patty mixture, the overload of onions made the whole patty literally fall apart upon sinking one's teeth into it and had a strong onion aroma. It was moist alright, but not juicy with beef flavour - all I could taste was the distracting onion mush within. The patty was nowhere dense enough, and I struggled to finish the burger. The garlic mayo I thought was a nice touch, but other than that, shake em' buns had been more like a kick in the booty for me. Suffice it to say, I would not be returning.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-shakeem-buns/20855?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
612,Shake'em Buns,Wan Chai,American,4.0,95.0,0.0,"Having been let down by one too many burger joints, it never really occurred to me to try Shake'em Buns until today.  Overcome with an urge to have a good burger, I headed towards S'eB with an obliging and hungry work mate.The joint is not big but feels spacious with the high ceiling and open shop front.   As we were really quite hungry, we didn't pay too much attention to the decor but went straight for the menu.  The content of the menu all seemed very tempting, but the menu itself was a little sticky, I think the management should do something about that.  From the blackboard by the road side, we knew there were combos but none was listed on the menu.  Apparently the only combo menu was on the wall but the words were way too small to be read properly from our table.  Another place for improvement.My colleague ordered a Cushin' for the Pushin' combo and I the Hawaiian Surfer Girl.  The burgers were quite hefty and so they should be.  Personally I think all burgers should be of a certain minimum size before they can be called burgers !Now the moment of truth.... 'Tis GOOOOOOOD.... The buns were fab, crispy on the outside and soft inside, solid enough to hold up against the juicy patty but not so dense that it was an effort to chew.  The meat was flavourful, juicy and had the right texture, like what one would get with good, quality mince.  There was just the right amount of crispy lettuce, tomato and onion to complement the patty.  As I was busy chomping away the best burger i've had in ages, I forgot to try the chips, oh, sorry, fries.  But when the burger is this good, who needs fries??  I don't.A very satisfying meal, love it!"", ""I went to try Shake Em Buns for the first time on the weekend.I have been to other burger restaurants before and didn't expect anything out of the ordinary.

It\'s a refreshing cold starter, but nothing to write home about.Next up was the main dish for today - the sauted crab with glutinous rice cakes and soy sauce paste ().  This is usually one of my favorite dishes but unfortunately this one fell a little flat.  Not that it tasted bad or anything, but it just wasn\'t  exactly authentic.  Then I reminded myself that I was dining at a Maxim\'s outlet - where Cantonese and Sichuan dishes can show up on the menu of a Shanghainese restaurant.  What did I expect?The carp fish and shredded turnip soup () was pretty yummy.  It\'s been a while since I\'ve had this type of carp, but somehow mom never made use of this recipe.  The milky soup has the classic taste of ginger, spring onions and white pepper along with some rice wine.  I had some of the nice shredded turnip, but didn\'t end up touching the fish itself.This particular version of stewed ""lion head"" minced pork balls with vegetables () wasn\'t quite to my liking.  I have to say that there\'s nothing wrong with the execution here, only a matter of preference.  I grew up with mom pan-frying these giant meatballs until they are golden on the outside, with a just a hint of toasty and burnt flavor.  The ones here were stewed in clear broth, and still have the sort of translucent color and texture you find with pork that\'s been cooked just enough to stay pink. My friends seemed to really like these, though...We had half a dozen xiaolongbao (), and somehow I ended up having 3 of these... While these were pretty decent, they fell far short of the ones from Jiajia in Shanghai.

618,Shanghai Min,Central,Chinese,3.2,200.0,0.0,"Came here with eight other colleagues on a Friday for lunch. I was one of the three late-joiners so by the time I had arrived the orders have already been put through.The dishes were: tofu and cucumber as appetizers, Shanghai-style soy-sauce cooked duck, deep-fried small yellow fish, stir-fried beansprouts with bamboo, Shanghai-style pork dumplings, shredded pork with Chinese buns, and rice cake. Finally, we had osmanthus jelly pudding and deep-fried red bean paste and banana pancake for dessert.For a nine-people lunch, the selection was a good balance. Having a very sensitive bowel I have to stay on a FODMAP diet 95% of the time and it gives me a lot of trouble enjoying meals with people who don't know about my dietary requirements well enough. But here I could still eat almost everything, even if not in large quantities.For the price (which was only around $200 per person), I really cannot complain about the quality of the food, especially given that the restaurant was very spacious. It's difficult to find a place in Central where you can sit and talk in privacy and comfort.Often times my take-aways are above $200 and I would get much less quality. None of the dishes were particularly memorable, but for a restaurant chain I was happy with what they served. Nothing was completely off even though the way they made their dishes was not too authentic to the Shanghainese tradition.So back to the food--The tofu was of good quality, but the sauce overpowered the freshness of the tofu. Still tasted refreshing though if you avoid the sauce (which I had to). Something I would recommend for appetizer for a meal with over say six people. Cucumber was even better. Restaurants often source some of the lowest quality raw materials but Shanghai Min seems to be more than decent in that aspect. The cucumbers were freshly cut and still retained their cucumber juices and the seasoning went in perfect harmony with them. Definitely a highlight even if it was just an appetizer. Soy-sauce cooked duck was very nice. But it depends on whether you like your sauces sweet, as Shanghai dishes often inevitably do have a lot of sugar in them. Texture-wise the flesh was also very nice--not too soft nor too flakey--an indication that the duck is neither unfresh nor overcooked.Pork dumplings were OK. The skin was well-made. For this price, I was very impressed. The deep-fried fish was excellent also, as everyone agreed, but as I couldn't eat too much as it was deep-fried. Stir-fried beansprouts were good, but I would add a little less oil. Their chefs might not be extraordinary, but the raw materials they source are of better than average quality for restaurants in general. I didn't try the rice cakes as it was not something I would be able to digest. Shredded pork was a great disappointment. Too salty, too hard and too oily. But perhaps it wouldn't matter if, like the others, I spooned the pork into the buns (which I could not eat as it contained flour).I didn't have the dessert save for a small bite of the red bean paste, but the jelly seemed to be unimpressive based on other people's comments, while the pancake was quite alright.Overall an enjoyable meal where I got to eat a little bit of many things. I would definitely recommend the place to anyone looking to book for a large group of friends or colleagues in busy Central. And could I also add that they didn't have air conditioning blasting at 10 degrees? The temperature was very comfortable.

You can't miss it. Just 2-3 minutes away from CWB MTR station exit B. 0Of course, since snake warms you up, perfect for this cold weather. There was a small queue but the turnover rate was fast. I got a seat after 10 minutes wait. I already decided that I wanted the standard lunch set when looking at the menu placed outside ( in Chinese only, I believe). 1Other than snake, Se Wong Ye is also quite famous for their Cantonese roasts and other types of Chinese herbal soup.0Decor:The place was a bit crowded. It had about 5-6 round tables for four and numerous tables for two. About 40 persons in total (?) Be prepared to sit pretty close to your neighbors.  Not as luxurious as Ser Wong Fun but decent. Much better than Se Wong Sun. A lot brighter and cleaner with air conditioning.Snake set:I ordered the standard lunch set (HK$90), which consisted of a bowl of snake soup, rice with pork liver sausage and a plate of lettuce with oyster sauce.It came after a short wait.First, the snake soup:0About double the size of Se Wong Sun. But just half the amount of snake or even less. Quite a bit of chicken shreds in it. Still, believe it or not, almost double the amount of snake than Ser Wong Fun at central!The taste was good with crysamtimim leaves and lemon grass. Definitely worth a try. Rice: The rice was nicely steamed rice, soft, flavourful and aromatic. The black pork liver sausages might look intimidating but was quite good. It had a good balance between fat, liver and meat. Might be considered an acquired taste though. Some soy sauce was also sprinkled on top of the steamed rice. It's possibly special made as I seemed to detect a hint of Chinese herbs in it. !!0!!If you don't like the liver sausage, I noticed that you could change the topping at added price. Some customers around me changed it to Char Siu or roast chicken.Lettuce with oyster sauce: Pretty crisp. No complaints. Service: Normal. Not rude. Efficient. That's sufficient in such a local eatery. Conclusion:- Convenient location, high turnover rate.- Snake soup had decent amount of snake meat in it.- Clean and air conditioned. Service was not bad.All in all, great for a decent filling snake meal.Recommended.Call me snake (Escape from New York)Supplementary Information""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-she-wong-yee/13855?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw
620,Shelter Italian Bar & Restaurant,Causeway Bay,Italian,3.2,425.0,0.0,"Despite being nestled in a building in one of the densest areas of the world, Shelter was something of a refreshing dining experience as one simply would not have expected an open-air garden restaurant behind shiny fashion boutiques. Prices are slightly above mid-range and the team was staffed by frankly incompetent servers on our visit, but Shelter should be on your list of to-visit restaurants in Hong Kong anyway, if only just for coffee or after-work drinks. Just make sure to visit on a day with decent weather to avoid sitting through your meal while gusts whip at your hair and toss your salad into a friends face.It might be of interest to note that Shelters executive chef is a she, and with a fairly notable resume. The kitchen works with organic produce and focuses on northern Italian and Tuscan fare, the website says. I always remembered Tuscan food as being very down-to-earth, while my memories of northern Italian food are fond, broad as it may be to categorize widely different foods under the same term. All the happy faces with corner licking tongues from Level 4 invited reviewers and then the surge of negative reviews from genuine diners aside, I was eager to finally have a look (and taste) for myself.The menu looks intriguing and serious, neither frankly very special nor boring but somewhere in between. You have some very typical Italian dishes here and there, with an occasional twist for an uncommon palette of flavors. Say Filetto di Manzo, beef tenderloin with beer foam and organic tempura vegetables, or Coda di Rospo, sous vide monkfish tail combined with spicy salami.The two of us were here only briefly for a quick Saturday lunch, so the sample size is small, but we picked up some clues about why the place was so empty when we visited (only one table was occupied apart from ours): in general the food served probably didnt live up to the expectations the ample PR has set Shelter up to, plus many locals might not be so keen to pay for the organic premium, and service was a failure. Food came slowly and waiting staff was neither hospitable nor professional. We would give the restaurant another shot this year to see if our experience was a one-off anomaly. It would be a shame for an under-managed serving team to ruin an otherwise fine kitchen.Food Rundown0Lobster bisqueThis came out very creamy and savory, and the south Asian-inspired citrusy kick from lemongrass made it more interesting, although the dish would have been excellent anyway without it.0Steak with grilled vegetablesAsked for medium rare and this came in medium well. And it took the kitchen about 30 minutes to make this. The veggies were soaked in olive oil that was totally unnecessary. Somewhat of a disappointing dish, but it wasnt terrible.0Spinach salad with grilled portobelloGiven that Shelter had its own organic farm, I really had high hopes for its salads. Turned out that this was the only option available. It was just fine, but I would easily be able to find better tasting and better designed salads in Hong Kong.0Bread and coffee was only just okay. Expected a little more.0001', ""Food is quite nice. Ingredients were fresh. Presentations were neat and interesting. Portions are quite small though. And prices are not exactly cheap and I guess that's the reason the place was almost empty.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-shelter-italian-bar-restaurant/152984?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

The onsen egg was slightly over cooked and not running.  Soup was a bit tasteless and with thick noodles that became quite blend. Worst part is the dumplings were not hot!  They were precooked and left cold, likely for soaking them in the hot soup made it a bit better.  For the cost of hkd55, there were only 3 dumplings.  Personally finds it quite pricey for the quality.  After seating down for a while, I realized everyone eating there were tourists - mainly from mainland and then another family from Korea.  They were commenting the foods were great.  (Which makes me wonder if I just  ordered the wrong dish??!!!  ). But personally I dont think Im coming back, after seeing a huge bottle of chicken powder at the kitchen window.

Very nice texture when chewing and I guess the portion was pretty large considering I felt very full afterwards.Altogether, including a cold Soy Bean drink it came to HK$70 in total.

They were quite good at comforting customers, despite the carelessness.We were told that they had offered white geoduck instead which would normally be served at dinner only. Personally I preferred uni haha. Anyway. The sashimi were all so fresh and were of room temperature like those served at top-notched sushi bars. The white geoduck on the right side was ok. The  on the top right hand corner was quite good. The squid had some seaweed inside which was quite special. Toro was super fatty and even the red tuna was ok. The only complaint was that the rice which came along with the sashimi was just a normal hot rice.0The chef offered us this pickled radish with yuzu which was slightly sour and was so refreshing! It was really appreciated!$ 2401$ 240The quality of the sashimi in this set seemed even better! The shrimp was super delicious with a great sticky texture. The grilled white fish sushi in the middle and the grilled toro(?) sushi on the top left hand corner were so good that they melted in your mouth. You can tell that the quality of the sushi was high!

It had super great value for money!&0&The almond tofu on the left was included in the set while the houjicha pudding was offered to make up for the out-of-stock uni.The almond tofu was not too sweet. It was a bit hard and I think it could have been smoother.The houjicha pudding was way better as it was much more smooth although the houjicha flavour could have been stronger. We were told that it was normally served at dinner only.Overall, the quality of food was pretty high given the cost! Service was really good as the staff was very polite and they did try to introduce the food when served to you. It would have been even better if they did introduce all the sashimi and sushi to us.

I decided to try something new and chose Shiki Zen.Shiki Zen is located in Midtown and replaced Sushi To, Harlan Goldstein\'s foray into Japanese. It\'s from the same group as Sushi To but now it focuses on the simple Japanese udon. As it\'s from the same group, they didn\'t even bother to renovate the place. The entire place looks exactly the same as it\'s former restaurant. So, basically, they changed the name and the menu.During lunch hour, they have a semi buffet deal. Apparently, dinner is the same as my coworker went in the evening and it was the same deal but double the cost.lunch menu1lunch menulunch menu2lunch menuBut I just wanted a light meal and wasn\'t up for a buffet. They do have an a la carte menu so I only ordered a bowl of udon because that\'s all I wanted. Here I think service is a bit ... annoying? I ordered a bowl of noodles. That\'s all I wanted. I think it was a good amount of food for one person. When I ordered the noodles, the waiter paused and stood there. I thought he didn\'t hear me, so I repeated again my order. And the waiter stood there again. Finally, I said ""I don\'t want the buffet part. Just the noodles."" The waiter finally nodded and said ""Ok, that\'s fine. You don\'t need to order the buffet."" Were they expecting everyone to do the buffet thing? I looked around and it seemed EVERYONE was doing the buffet part. I felt that was a bit annoying that they expected me to add the buffet part when I only wanted udon. At least that\'s the impression I got when the waiter didn\'t leave and continued to wait for me to ""finish"" my order. As if one bowl of noodles was not enough here?Homemade Udon with Snow Crab Meat in Sticky Egg Soup ($148). This was a hot udon in soup. When I ordered this, the waiter informed me that their udon is technically harder than normal, so did I want the kitchen to cook it longer and make it softer? Um...no. I don\'t want soggy udon. Give it to me as how the chef wants to make it!Portion size was a fairly decent size. It wasn\'t too big and wasn\'t too small. Soup was thick and actually quite rich in flavor.0There were strands of snow crab and well..one whole piece in my bowl.0And the udon? Pretty good. It was chewy but not tough. It had a nice smooth texture.0I was fairly full after I finished my bowl and I thought it was a fairly decent bowl of udon. Yes, a bit pricey for noodles but it was of fairly good quality. The only annoying thing was the service as I felt they expected people to go with the buffet. The buffet, I looked was ok, serving your usual Japanese buffet items. I wasn\'t too interested even if I did want a larger lunch. I don\'t know if I\'d return as it seemed they were more geared for buffets and that turns me off a little bit. I feel the same as I did when it was once called Sushi To. Food was ok but not worth the price.

It was kind of a new try.0For the , when the dish was presented in front of you, it's just a beautiful picture that your eyes are pleased. The colorful dish(crystal light blue) with the super fresh uni (orange), egg (yellow), and chu tuna (pink) did make an art piece just by looking at it.Especially, the Uni was so fresh, made me feel like I was eating it right from the tsukiji fish market. In addition, the chu tuna was also perfect, after you put it into your mouth, feels like it melt inside. The egg was alright. Most important was the sushi rice, it wasn't so sour or hard. Tough to explain but one can see the sushi chef must have many years of experience under his belt of cooking such quality sushi rice.0For the dessert, I chose a red bean ice cream. It's not those you bought from the supermarket. It's handmade from the chef with chosen ingredient. This one you can really taste the red bean texture unlike those made by machine. It's a dessert will make girls go crazy about it since there isn't much sugar added.0There is one thing worth mention which is the sushi bar, customer can choose to sit in front of the sushi chefs and watch over the whole process; I think that is really cool, kind of like most high class sushi restaurant in Tokyo. Moreover, all the interior decoration combined with bright light setting made it feel elegant for customers sitting there to enjoy all the delicious dish.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-shimo/439960?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

The restaurant has since closed down in Causeway Bay so my recent visit was to the one in Admiralty. I was always impressed with the beauty of the crystal sushi, the rose petals and delicate taste in the gelatin enhances the whole sushi experience in taste as well as being most pleasant to the eye. For this visit, I tried their new crystal sushi: Salmon Roe Jelly with Diced Crystal Sushi and Beetroot Jelly with taraba Crystal Sushi. Both were disappointing.The gelatin on the Salmon Roe Jelly, was too hard, it did not have the soft tender texture that I experienced 2 years ago. For the one with Beetroot jelly, it was not much better either.Neither of these crystal sushi were made with the passion of combining beauty and fresh taste that I remembered from their Causeway Bay store.Today these sushi were just overpriced, and not executed with fresh ingredients. The other 'normal' sushi that Itook from the sushi train was no better than what you can find from a cheaper sushi restaurant.As a saving grace, at least one dish maintained the high standard I remembered from before; the chicken Tsukune. It is chicken ball served with raw egg for dipping. It was moist and juicy , exactly the way I remembered.

Overall taste was OK only, quite bland, even my favourite salmon.  The eel was alright though.Decor: Several tables and two separate bar stool areas, one at the bar and one at the kaiten sushi (conveyer belt/).  I was seated at the bar.  Maybe the kaiten sushi would've been more interesting, but hey, it was busy lunch hour.Service: I found everyone's service courteous enough.Bill: With tea and 10% service, it came to $174.

Originally from Japan, their first branch in Hong Kong is located in Sheung Wan on Gought Street. They became so popular they opened another branch in Quarry Bay. Garnering a Michelin Bib for four years now, they are a must for many ramen fans.So, why haven't I tried it yet?Mainly for their soup base. A fish based broth that people have reported to have a very vinegar like taste. I wasn't sure. Would I like it? It always made me pause.As I was at PMQ to view the Mlle Prive exhibition, I decided to pop here for lunch.1Inside was the design was all in wood. Just like the front of the restaurant. It gave it a very retro ramen feel.0They have one room where you can see where they make the noodles.0Even the design of the menu was very nice and was wood.0Menu is in English and Chinese. You order off the menu.0As they are famous for tsukemen, boyfriend and I both ordered a bowl. For price, you can choose how much noodles (100g, 200g and 300g) at no additional charge. You can also choose how rich you want your broth and if you want hot or cold noodles.I chose the Shugetsu tsukemen in a light broth for $89. It included half an egg and no char siu. Just noodles. This is the 200g portion. It looked big but actually, it was placed on top of a bamboo mat. The noodles were the thick kind and were ok. The egg was super salty.0The soup was really sour. I expected it to be sour but wow ... was it ever sour. It was like drinking a bottle of vinegar. It was also lukewarm. As I ordered cold noodles, I expected the soup to be piping hot so it would balance out as that is how a good tsukemen is served. But as it was lukewarm, dunking my cold noodles into it just further made the soup cold. I wasn't too pleased and I guess here you have to break with tradition and order hot noodles instead. But oddly while dipping my noodles, the acidity lessened somewhat. Or maybe I was getting used to it? I also found the soup to be far too oily. There was a thick layer of oil on top. After I was done eating my noodles, I asked for soup. But instead of how most places just give you a thermos kettle of clear broth, this place has the staff pour it for you. And did they really dilute it! They pretty much diluted it to the top of my bowl. it was so much, I couldn't finish it. But after the addition of clear broth, the acidity lessened even more. It actually tasted better.0Boyfriend wanted meat so he ordered the one with grilled Kurobuta pork belly ($112) in 300 g size. This, too, was placed on top of a bamboo mat to make it appear like it was falling over. But in actuality, it wasn't lot of noodle. The pork belly was ok. I felt it didn't melt in my mouth and it was super oily. Boyfriend liked it more than me.0His broth was more stronger as he wanted a rich broth. Somehow, ordering the richer broth the vinegar taste wasn't as strong. It was there, but not as strong. It was more balanced with the taste of the fish.0I didn't like it as much as boyfriend. He loved it. So, I guess if you would like to try it, I would suggest the richer broth. They do have regular ramen along with an abura version (where you just get noodles without soup and it's rolled in oil). Would I be back? Perhaps to try the abura.

631,Shun King Restaurant,Wan Chai,Chinese,3.7,41.0,0.0,"This is my first time to eat in this restaurant. Before I went there, I have read the OPEN RICE comment that the baked pork chop rice is yummy.  Therefore, I ordered it at once.The service is excellent. When the staff saw me, she immediately welcomed me and gave me the menu.The delivery time is very short, at first, I thought the baked dish would take at least 20 mins, but it took only within 5-7 mins.The pork chop is fresh and juicy. Unlike Cafe De Coral, I didn't get thirsty after eating, so I guess surely no MGS in it.To my surprise, there is mushroom in the rice, very good, very special.The pork chop is more than the Cafe De Coral as well.Cold Milk Tea: very delicious as well, though there was a bit more milk, it is my cup of tea exactly!!!This will be my 'usually visited restaurant' from now on.Next time, I will try baked chicken rice here, you know, no many restaurant has this dish.  And not many could bake this well, but I am sure if they can baked good pork chop rice, so as baked chicken one.I will recommend to all of you, esp those like baked rice."", ""after pausing at happy cake shop for my , i had lunch at this . having no idea what to order, i resorted to a plate of 'fung yung dan fan'.it looked kinda salty because of the soy sauce the waitress had generously poured over the dish-but as i took the first bite, the eggs with strips of cha siu, onion and spring onion-was very delicately seasoned-ie. not too salty nor tasteless. the eggs were not overcooked-and the edges were crispy. wow.  it was good. what a pity that i couldnt finish the whole dish because of the diet i am constantly on. a 9.5 out of 10, for the waitresses were a bit annoying.  but its personal i guess, plus it would be an unreasonable demand for a  to be deadly quiet. plus, the afternoon tea set(served from 2:30 pm onwards) seems like a bargin to me.  a lot of people rushed in once the clock ticked 2:30, so i guess i will pay this  another visit to try it out. 00""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/wan-chai-shun-king-restaurant/3168?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

A pretty small Thai restaurant that offers pretty good foodn authentic or not I supposed I'm not experienced enough to tell. However the food certainly tasted pretty good for my palate. The Tom Yum Gong I think is one of the best ones in town, I thought the green curry was also decent but maybe just a little too sweet. Overall pretty satisfied with the food. But just one suggestion to the owner: I understand that you may be trying to create a young and modern atmosphere, but Thai rap music is probably not going to help. In fact without going further I believe is one of the things I disliked about the restaurant.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-siam-28/464664?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
633,Siam Noodles,Causeway Bay,Thai,3.1,73.0,0.0,"Decided to try a new lunch spot in Causeway Bay before heading for work. I came across a place called Siam Noodles. Apparently serving Thai boat noodles in a modern design. They also serve other items as well but it seemed the y focused on noodles.Menu is in English and Chinese. There is no 10% service charge and you pay on your way out. They have not only traditional boat noodles but they also serve up fancy versions like wagyu beef and lobster. Obviously, boat noodles for the hip. And if you don't like the boat noodle soup, you can change it to clear broth or tom yum soup. Choice of noodle is also available so there is a lot of choice.0I ordered the chicken leg with boat noodle soup and pad thai noodles ($68). Food comes out really fast. Portion size was a decent size. Not too big but not small. I was full when I left but I'm sure if boyfriend came, he'd be starving. There was a lot of nice crunchy deep fried pig skin that didn't feel like eating deep fried fat. This I found in other places that serve boat noodle. I never liked the taste of eating deep fried fat. These ones at least tasted like a bag of pork cracklings. The noodles were chewy and good. There was one okra, two mushy fish balls and a piece of daikon that was flavorless. The soup was a bit spicy but not too much I couldn't eat it. However, it wasn't was rich as other places I've had it. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great as well.0Place is clean. Food was fine but not memorable. But easier access to boat noodles if I ever had a craving.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-siam-noodles/631135?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
634,Sing Heung Yuen,Central,Chinese,3.9,50.5,,"2If I were to pick a particular kind of noodles to represent Hong Kong, I would give my vote to this unique and comforting noodles in condensed tomato broth other than cart noodles () that would have come to your mind. Thick broth is always the soul of noodles, regardless of whatever ingredients to be put inside. To pair pho with vietnam, ramen with japanese, boat noodles with thai, then Sing Heung Yuen\'s tomato noodles with Hong Kong.0Tucked away in an open space linking to a staircase at the back streets of Central-Sheungwan area, the halfly al fresco eatery is all the time busy. With canvas as shelters and placed with simple stools and wooden tables, the ""daipaidong"" stood there for more than 40 years, but it wasn\'t until 2000 that they started specialising in tomato broth dishes.0There aren\'t many food stalls like this remaining in Hong Kong, the license of which stemmed from wartime Hong Kong and was only given to families with injured civil servants with limited transfer of ownership. Originally operating as an all-round Chinese eatery serving a variety of cha chaan teng food, it added tomato slices to a bowl of noodles as requested by a customer, which in turn creates the legend of tomato broth noodles. At an average price of $35 for a bowl which is on a par with a meal box in fast food shop, it brings locals who desperately need an affordable meal, and tourists/ holiday commuters who are drawn by the fame of divine goodness of broth.Kitchen0KitchenAmong daipaidongs that I have ever visited, hygiene condition of this is way above average. Apparently looking fine on a sunny day that I paid this visit, it doesn\'t look that bad on rainy days either. Canvas above you do its job well to shelter you away from the rain but at the same time don\'t shed water on your back. While tables, stools and metal fans are gone when the shop closes, these green shacks remain, which are in fact the indispensable part, the Kitchen.Kitchen0KitchenNoodles are prepared in one side, the space of which is just fit for 1-2 ladies\' moving around. Another side is for roasting crispy bun and preparing sandwiches. Given such a petite kitchen and limited staff, the food stall is operated smoothly with high efficiency. Sun or rain may determine how long you have to wait to be seated, but time and season doesn\'t really matter. With nearly flawless memories of the ladies, your order is usually served within 10 minutes after getting seated.0The menu seems to be long, but in fact just repeats combinations of ingredients, the price of which mainly varies with number of ingredients. The exuberant menu covers noodles with/without tomato broth, sandwiches, buns and drinks. What to be put inside noodles are common enough to be found elsewhere, such as beef, ham, sausages, luncheon meat, pork chop and chicken wings. Noodles served after breakfast time are instant noodles and macaroni.0 Macaroni with tomato, scrambled eggs with corned beef and beef $35  - Macaroni with tomato, scrambled eggs with corned beef and beef...$ 352  - Macaroni with tomato, scrambled eggs with corned beef and beef...$ 35A vibrant bowl of red greeted me, however red to the extent that it looks a bit eccentric to be edible. There lies no doubt of its genuine tomato content, which is a hearty mix of several types of canned tomatoes with variance in sweetness/ acidity. 0About the broth - Not much oil floats around, just a little bit probably from the scrambled eggs. What makes the fame is how thick the tomato broth is, which is not made by adding tomato slices or concentrate into boiled water. Pot of delectable tomato soup is cooked every day with lots of tomatoes, thus giving such a visually-inspiring red broth with plenty of tomato slices. The broth tastes tangy and superbly refreshing, without much add-on of artificial sweetness.Tomato and macaroni0Tomato and macaroniAbout the other ingredients - Beef and scrambled eggs with corned beef are my all-time favourites that never disappoint. Eggs with finely chopped beef is mildly fried and scrambled, therefore it can\'t be firm enough to be held long on a spoon or chopsticks. Permeated with aroma of not totally done egg and briny beef, pieces of scrambled eggs are blended beautifully, so flavourful on its own that neither egg nor beef overpowers each other. - Scrambled egg with corned beef0 - Scrambled egg with corned beefBeefis always tender and without tendon, which nearly melts in your mouth with a sip of tomato broth. Smooth and gentle, there lies no necessity to linger long in your mouth but swallow. Robust beef flavour remains from plain beef slices, which suggests \'less is more\'. - Beef0 - Beef Butter & Honey with Lemon Crispy Bun $16 - Butter & Honey with Lemon Crispy Bun$ 162 - Butter & Honey with Lemon Crispy Bun$ 16Adding sandwiches to a bowl of noodles will be too much, but never say no to a crispy bun which is without substantial toppings that make you full. Firstly roasted to make it crispy and applied a thin spread of lemon honey, the bun tastes zesty and is easy to consume even without a sip of soup or drinks. Slices of four are not difficult to handle, or you may put it as the bread to go with the soup just like appetisers. Crispy on the exterior and slightly tender inside, a simple spread makes an elevated spin by the utter freshness of acidic lemon.00It is not a surprise that most of us finish off the tomato broth like this. Just like ramen, it seems to be paying tribute to the chef, but it is genuinely decadent instead of courtesy that makes me drink it all up. Hearty noodles as always, Sing Heung Yuen is one (among several) of my favourite local eateries where I long for a visit at desperate times. What I pay is truly worth the wait and crawl, instead of going to food presentation and vibes.0', '! , , 1,, !, ,  ! , ! , !++!, , ar,, ,  , !!0'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-sing-heung-yuen/10577?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

Toppings include gammon ham, turkey, smoked almon and Italian style bruschetta.  You could either choose your own bagel + spread+ toppings combination or go for a pre-designed combo.  I went for an All-in-one bagel + bruschetta and my friend had ""Santa\'s Diet"" (Turkey + strawberry spread + original bagel).  The bagels were sliced and toasted fresh upon ordering.  They were crispy on the outside and chewy inside - just as a bagel should be.  They were also very generous with the spreads and toppings.  There was only one person making the bagels so you had to wait a while but it was worth the wait.They also serve fresh fruit smoothies but I had my heart set on froyo so I gave the smoothies a miss! They charge by weight and have a variety of toppings including many types of fresh fruits, granola, cocopops, digestive biscuits, red bean paste and cranberries etc.  They also had home-made mochis (green tea, strawberry, chocolate and original) which looked good although I was full from the bagel so I did not end up having any toppings.  The froyo was very good - tangy  and smooth.All in all, a very healthy and filling lunch. Service was great although when more people discover this little shop and it starts filling up it may need to increase its shop staff.'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-sloop-froyo-bagel/48301?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

Not only that I do not have to call the restaurant myself, but I could earn points for both site to redeem other awards.It was a sunny sweaty day in Hong Kong, it might not be the best idea to hike up to Soho for lunch. Luckily the air-conditioner of the restaurant is strong enough, together with the iced water being served, I managed to cool down quickly. As for the lunch menu, it is quite economical with a variety of different food. I picked the fried fish with egg noodles with salad as appetiser.

It doesn't really feels like Thai food, as Thai food are usually associated with heavier taste.All in all, it was a nice spot for lunch, but I guess I won't travel all the way to Soho just to try this restaurant.

My husband had a nice bowl of noodlesoup, he really loves that and enjoyed it. I had rice noodle with shrimps and vegetables. I was much better than I expected for that price!

Staff are friendly and attentive and feel like a part of the family now.For a work treat once every couple of months, I bring my team here for a very reasonably priced set lunch.  The set menu is usually limited to a choice between two appetizers and a main which also includes any of the pizzas on the menu.  If we decide to splash out and pick from the main menu, Spaghetti Di Mare (spaghetti with seafood) served with white wine sauce is a particular favourite of my team, as is my personal favourite Penne (or if you prefer, swap this for spaghetti) Voldastana  served with speck ham & asparagus in pink sauce (sauce Marie). If pizzas are more your thing then there is a whole range cooked fresh on the premises, a particular treat being the Capricciossa made with tomato sauce, mozzarella, homemade sausage, bell pepper and spicy salami. I've also taken visitors from the UK and Australia here for dinner. The menu is largely the same but it's a good excuse to try out some of the secondis such as involtini (pan-fried beef rolls stuffed with smoked ham, mushrooms & cheese) or ossobucco (braised veal shank) and sample their great selection of wines.One bit of advice: if you are going for lunch, book ahead.

It was quite a large place with comfortable seats.Lunch Menu3Lunch MenuThe Salads and desserts buffet was charged at a cost of $188+10%. We each ordered this as well as some pizzas and pastas to share. The top-up price of $66+10% seemed quite attractive.Salads Buffet0Salads BuffetPlease excuse me for not having taken photos of the Salads and Desserts buffet tables. To be frank, I honestly thought that there could have been more choices at such a price at the beginning.There were 3 types of Italian cold cuts including Parma ham, normal ham and salami. So bad there were no melons to go along with the Parma ham. There were other meat including thin pork slices with tuna sauce which I found really delicious and tender, and also duck breasts which I didn't try.There were a few types of greens, among which the spinach tasted particularly fresh and good. Some lettuces had turned a little bit brown though.There were also some pre-made and pre-mixed salads like Greek salad, pumpkin salad, rice salad etc. Toppings included some olives, dried tomatoes and walnuts. There was just one type of really hard cheese though.The Mascarpone cheese on the beetroot slices tasted really good with my favourite soft cheese texture. The asparagus was pretty fresh too.There were two types of soups: tomato soup and pumpkin soup. I tried the pumpkin soup which was above average, with the right degree of concentration.There were also some Italian bread and focaccia which I didn't have room to try.Overall, I would say the quality of the salads buffet was above average after trying, and the choices were sufficient to fill your stomach.Our pizzas and pastas arrived shortly after our orders.Salmone Affumicato Pizza (Tomato sauce, mozzarella, smoked salmon, rocket)...$ 660Salmone Affumicato Pizza (Tomato sauce, mozzarella, smoked salmon, rocket)...$ 66I didn't eat the smoked salmon pizza right away and when I ate it it had cooled down already. Yet it was still good with crispy and thin crust. It was not overly salty with the smoked salmon and mozzarella. The only complaint was that there was not enough rocket paste (the green paste?) on the pizza. At a price of $60+10% to top up for this pizza, I would say it was quite a good value for money. The portion was indeed big. It was good to share.Margherita Pizza (Tomato sauce, mozzarella, basil)$ 660Margherita Pizza (Tomato sauce, mozzarella, basil)$ 66Comparatively, the Margherita pizza was less pleasing although the crust was also crispy and thin.

The tagliatelle was much better although it was no longer al dente, yet it offered a very rich egg flavour. The taggiasca olives were surprisingly free of the typical yucky olive flavour, as I was never a fan of olives. Overall, I would say pizzas were way better than pastas.Desserts Buffet0Desserts BuffetThere were quite a few choices of desserts and the quality of all those I had tried was pretty good.The berry mousse cake on the left was very delicious and light despite the white cream.The lemon tart in the middle was pretty light too.The pistachio ball with coffee cream inside was tasty although the coffee cream was not particularly rich (which was actually good for me because I was never a fan of coffee) and the cookie case was super crunchy!The caramel ball was also delicious and looked so attractive.The chocolate brownie at the far end of my plate was also crunchy and not particularly greasy.There were also other choices of desserts which I had no room to try.There was also a bowl of diced fruits on the desserts buffet table.Service was ok although the restaurant seemed to be full house. At such a price, I think the quality of the food especially desserts (maybe not the pasta), the location, the interior decoration, the environment and the service did justify the cost. Glad that now I have one more choice on my to-go list for lunch."", 'We had seen the menu online before coming here and expected the salad and dessert buffet to be $188. Turns out, because it was a public holiday(?), they were serving a special brunch buffet menu for $388. Ok, fair enough, guess it was our fault and we should have double checked. However, we wanted to see if the $188 buffet was still available. Doesnt hurt to ask right?Everything went downhill from there.The server/manager? (he was the only male staff in a suit who walked around with an unmistakable sense of self importance) came to our table thinking we wanted to order but instead we asked about the other buffet menu. He replied condescendingly that the only buffet menu is the one in our hands. Uh, thanks for talking down to us? Its amazing how a cheap suit can make an unrefined man so arrogant. Nothing against his uniform, but hey, manners maketh man. Ok fine, having a random stranger give us major attitude is not the best way to start a birthday brunch with my girlfriends but since we were here already might as well stay. The buffet comes with a main,  so we decided to order 1 main each for the 5 of us. These upscale restaurants usually have small portions anyway. Unfortunately, it was again the cocky manager who came to our table when we wanted to order. When he found out we were ordering 5 mains, he said something along the lines of - wow, thats a lot of food. You ladies must be very hungry. With the same condescension as before, of course. Excuse me? That comment was wrong for many reasons. Besides, last I checked the main was INCLUDED, whats wrong with getting the full amount of food were paying for? We later figured that he probably didnt want to waste food, thinking we wouldnt be able to finish everything. No wonder he said hed give us only 2 of the 5 mains first. Under other circumstances I may have attributed that to thoughtful service but with all the snarky comments this guy was making I dont think he was being so kind.To be fair, apart from that one guy, everyone else who worked there seemed really nice. The food is ok, not bad, but the service was truly disappointing and simply unacceptable. Needless to say, we wont be back.00', ""To celebrate my friend's birthday, we went there for a birthday brunch. Excellent service !

Replacing Lupa on the third floor of LHT Tower in Central, Spiga headlined just a small list of newbies making their debuts prior to the Christmas season.Spiga has brought to us by Dining Concepts in collaboration with two-Michelin-starred chef Enrico Bartolini. I first heard of chef Bartolini when he was the consulting chef for the now-closed Venetian restaurant SEPA and he put together quite an impressive menu highlighted by some really exciting bite-sized cicchetti. As one of the youngest Italian chef to ever score two Michelin stars, my expectation is naturally high for his new project Spiga.0I had the pleasure of celebrating my birthday here a few years ago when the place was still called Lupa. If my memory serves me correctly, this is pretty much the same dcor as it was under Mario Batali.0My lunch started off brightly with a nice set of house made bread following by an amuse bouche of fresh tomato, ricotta cheese on top of some bread crumbs. Pretty refreshing start.Amuse bouche  - fresh tomato, ricotta cheese0Amuse bouche  - fresh tomato, ricotta cheeseLinguini with Sicilian red prawn and green asparagus ($258) - I have heard a lot of good things about Spiga\'s homemade pastas so it would be a huge mistake if I didn\'t start my meal off with one. I decided to give their linguini with Sicilian red prawn a go and it turned to be the best decision I made all day.1The linguini was perfectly al dente, working well with the lightly cooked Sicilian red prawn.

That was very disappointing considering that it\'s been labeled as one of the restaurant\'s signature dish.Grilled Black Angus tenderloin with potatoes millefuille and ""Crudaiola"" sauce...$ 3580Grilled Black Angus tenderloin with potatoes millefuille and ""Crudaiola"" sauce...$ 358Traditional tiramisu ($98) - Obviously, they sensed something was wrong after I left half of my tenderloin unfinished so my server came over and offered me a dessert for free.

Despite coming in a very small package (almost like bite-size), it was surprisingly good. Love the fact that it\'s soft and moist with the mascarpone cream covering a tiny layer of expresso soaked ladyfingers on the bottom. The amount of liqueur in there was nearly perfect. Pretty nice.0After the homemade linguini (which was excellent), it was a bit of a roller coaster ride but I was glad to end the meal on a high note with a complimentary tiramisu which was fairly decent. I think I probably don\'t mind coming back some other time as long as I can stay away from a certain meat dish.', 'Well decorated and good environment. Fresh ingredients and taste good. Lunch salad and dessert buffet, cost $188, worth to visit.

It is quite an ambitious project as the restaurant is very large (more than 120 seats) along with open area for outdoor seating.  We are surprised as the only couple in the restaurant during their Sunday brunch section.  It is almost too lonely in certain way.  Good that half way of the brunch, there came 2 or 3 more couples.  Otherwise, it would be a scary scene.  Hopefully, the quietness is only due to soft opening trial period.Sunday brunch being offered at HKD 388 with a choice of main dish.  The buffet comes with around 30 choices of cold cut, salad, cheese, bread, crab and lobster, hot lasagna, etc.  There are also more than 10 different desserts.The buffet food quality overall is very good as the seafood are very fresh.  The lasagna and eggplant hot food at the buffet bar is particular good, and in my opinion, it is even better than the main dish.  It certainly has the home made taste.  The eggplant has a very soft creamy texture and strong flavour that makes me go for another round instantly.  For the main dish, we ordered the home made angel hair with tomato sauce and fried egg with spinach black truffle.  The angel hair pasta got a very good chewy texture while the tomato sauce is just average though.  The fried egg spinach with truffle is very good.  We are pleasantly surprised by the amount of black truffle slices sit on top of the dish.  It matches very well with the egg and tendered spinach.  In my opinion, the pasta dish is a bit ordinary but when we mixed the two dishes together for sharing, it is a perfect companion.Afterwards, we each went for their dessert bar and we are also pleased by the dessert quality.  The tiramisu and creme brulee are the best among all.  Overall, we are pleased with the food quality but maybe due to the buffet nature, there arent a single dish that really stands out that make us feel memoriable.  However, you can sense there are certain home made taste being associated with the dishes.  Setting is very comfortable with high ceiling and warm lightning but again, they are still in the soft opening period and a couple of things are still a bit sloppy for the service.  For restaurant that can potentially occupy more than 120 guests would definitely requires a perfect execution and management.   Also, it would take sometime for them to mark their identity in the competitive HK culinary field.  We will definitely come back for their dinner menu as the lunch buffet certain hasnt really shown Chef Enrico's full calibre.

651,Spuntini,Wan Chai,Italian,3.6,170.0,,"On the day that we decided to have lunch here (it was a Saturday, by the way),  the weather could not be worse - the No.3 typhoon signal was hoisted, it was raining heavily, and with thick black clouds up above in the sky and the sun nowhere in sight, our moods were pretty down and we badly needed a boost; fortunately, it turned out that we picked the right place this time . This new establishment is the first in HK to introduce the unique brand of food products inspired by the two-starred Michelin chef, Moreno Cedroni, who is known for his simple yet delicious creations throughout the world. Located on the St. Francis, just a short walk from the Queen\'s Road East, the restaurant was pretty small, with a capacity for 30 persons or so at most, with simple decor and adequate spacing between tables. The restaurant was in fact, part-cafe, part-wine bar, and part-deli, with a counter displaying a dazzling array of products (mainly jam and various sauces for pasta, with some interesting ingredients like monkfish liver and tuna belly etc), as well as nice nibbles like sandwiches, stuffed olives and sweet peppers, salad, and desserts. The funny looking water glass was the next item to catch our attention - was it inspired by the Pisa tower ?  Anyway, we decided to go for the set lunches, and before long, food was ready for our comsumption.First to arrive was the Amouse Bouche, or ""mouth amuser"", which was intended as a small cold dish to kick start our palate before the meal. It was nicely made in the form of a sushi, with some rice (?risotto) made into a small cube, with a piece of smoked salmon and a leaf (?arugula) placed on top. Although the thing looked nice and appealing, unfortunately it tasted rather bland and was not particularly impressive  This is certainly one item that they could work on to improve further. Next came the soup and the bread rolls. The soup was classic minestrone served in a small bottle, and it was rich and tasty, with lots of mixed vegetables as ingredients and cooked in a tomato based broth; my only comment was on the serving temperature, which was only luke-warm and not hot enough for our taste. On the other hand, the bread rolls were fine as they were quite hot in temperature and cripsy. Overall not a bad start, just hope they could control the serving temperature of the soup a bit better.The mains arrived after a 15-20 min wait. The Grilled seafood risotto  was quite nice, with the risotto cooked just right, served with grilled shrimps, scallop, fish fillet and some vegetables. The seafood tasted fresh to us, and the creamy sauce made the dish really delicious and enjoyable  In contrast, the Grilled half chicken with herbs was less satisfatory; for although the portion was huge, somehow the aroma of the herbs did not manage to infiltrate into the meat of the chicken, and some parts of the chicken meat was quite tough in texture, especially the chicken breast  Still, I think the chicken would probably still score a pass unless you are a really picky gourmet. Overall not too bad for the mains, but I would suggest to stay away from the chicken if you have a choice. For desserts, the complimentary fruit tarts  suffered from the same problem with the mouth amusers - they looked nice but tasted so-so only; and they were very small in size, too. At the end we decided to get a final boost and ordered a tiramisu as dessert; this turned out to be fine, with the liquor and cheese flavors in the right proportions and the right texture, being not too soggy in the bottom . The coffee that came at the end, freshly brewed and richly aromatic, also served as a nice conclusion to our meal. At the end of the meal, the friendly and helpful wait staff also showed us around the place and introduced to us the various items on sale in the shop. They even gave us some samples to try out before we actually made the purchase. We were most grateful to them, for they helped to made our stay even more memorable and enjoyable We spent almost 1.5 hours with the meal. At the end, we found that the rain had stopped and hence we could move on again. It was indeed a simple Italian on a rainy afternoon; we look forward to coming back again soon, perhaps for dinner, and hopefully the weather (and the food) would be even better then as compared to the present.""Mouth amuser"": looks nice but taste so-so only0""Mouth amuser"": looks nice but taste so-so onlyBread rolls: hot and freshly made0Bread rolls: hot and freshly madeMinestrone: rich and tasty, but not hot enough0Minestrone: rich and tasty, but not hot enoughGlass: inspired by the Pisa tower ?0Glass: inspired by the Pisa tower ?Grilled seafood risotto: creamy and delicious0Grilled seafood risotto: creamy and deliciousGrilled half chicken: not bad, but could be better0Grilled half chicken: not bad, but could be betterFruit tarts: again, looks better than taste0Fruit tarts: again, looks better than tasteTiramisu: dessert of the day0Tiramisu: dessert of the day', 'Was hunting a restaurant for lunch to celebrate a project completion and found Spuntini on Openrice. First attracted by the photos posted by other commentators and proofed that they were right.It\'s not a big restaurant but cozy and comformable with glass window. We, a group of 4, went there on a weekday for lunch and it was almost full when we got there at 12:45pm.Ordered dishes and comments as follows:1. Antipasto salad (choice of 4: zucchini, bell pepper, mushroom & eggplant). Not many restaurants offer this as part of the lunch set selections during weekdays, which shud be appreciated. The portion is smaller than i expected, actually 4 of us can finish 2 dishes with 4 choices each if we want to. Quality is mediocre but acceptable. Anyway i didn\'t expect it to be very good, but can try if one crave for it suddenly.2. Grilled seafood ($65 @)It\'s in  style, small portion and we order 2 pieces. Smell and taste nice, the seafood is fresh and freshly grilled.3. Roasted chicken ($105)It\'s well made. The chicken is  and previsely seasoned. 4 of us shared one. Reminds me of Rosemary chicken of Armaronie\'s which i like. It comes with with side dish of potato wedges but don\'t taste special. 4. Spaggati bolognese mozzarellaIdeal for a lady\'s lunch portion. Quite al dante, quality ok.5. Parma ham rissottoGenerous slices of parma ham, though the taste of rice is com si com sa. 6. TiramisuThis is the only choice of dessert but good. Served in a magarita glass cup with a strawberry on top. I like the thick coca powder on top. Have nice flavour of almond wine. Creamy enough (but not those mousse like tiramisu) and enough for 2 girls to share 1 after finishing the above dishes. 7. CoffeeCertainly acceptable, i\'d say similar to illy quality. Overall comment:a fine little restaurant in the area of ""Star Street"". Average lunch set price (item 3 - 5 above can be ordered as set) around $80 - 90 with coffee / tea. Sandwiches like panini are available in lunch set menu. Generally saying, it\'s pretty good and we enjoyed the lunch there. I\'d recommend to go again for a fine lunch to treat ourselves good or a cozy dinner with reasonable price. There are wines and other products, eg. jam, for sale in the restaurant but I didn\'t have time to explore.Btw, wine during happy hour (12nn - 7pm) is $38 per glass only, worth to have one during lunch for an easy afternoon'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/wan-chai-spuntini/23692?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

Surprisingly it was not very crowded. The restaurant environment is large and comfortable with a modernistic interior design. I got a small round table facing the window. Similar to all other Starbucks stores, orders are placed outside at the counter area. However, customers dont need to stand and wait for the food and drink.

Unlike other stores that are usually very fast paced with a lot of crowd, movement and noise; this flagship store gives a relaxing and comfortable sensation. Its a great place to spend a relaxing weekend.', ""Chicken and mushroom pie ($26)0Not my first time having this as a quick lunch. I found that the fat ratio in their chicken mushroom pie has reduced. I remember I used to be able to find pieces of chicken fat skin in the pie but they only have lean chicken meat and some creamy mushroom suace inside the buttery and flaky pie crust.The service was also exceptionally quick which literally took around 2 mins to have my piping hot pie ready with a pack of ketchup.I found that the food at Starbucks has been improving from time to time and I can't wait for more better food quality and more delicious options.0"", ""Soba Teriyaki Chicken Salad1For 100g, it is around 200 calories, but I truely believe you can cut quite a fair bit if you skip the sesame seed sauce, chicken skin, and the egg yolk, but I just don't care!1The size was just perfect for a light lunch. The mixed green was hidden underneath with soba, cherry tomatoes, marinated seaweed, a few pieces of very tender chicken breasts, soft boiled egg, and some sesame seed sauce.1The chicken was not dried nor tough, it was instead moist and tender, after being nicely marinated with ligth teriyaki sauce which was also not too savoury to my liking. The soft boiled egg was also surprising since it was runny with a rich egg yolk taste.1To me, I think Starbuck's salad is a lot better than before in terms of taste, quality of ingredients, nutrition value. I am definitely excited to try some of their other salad!""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-starbucks-coffee/578821?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

But the mint flavor can be more harder coz I already requested 4 pump of mint sauce, still the mint taste is still very light. Perhaps I requested to skip all the classic syrup thus the mint flavor is not strongly enough.

So awesome ;)', ""Today I went shopping with a friend in IFC. In lunchtime, we decided to have a quick lunch in the mall. Finally we chose Starbucks. For Starbucks, I think there should be nothing special to have a food review as hkgers are familiar with this chain cafe. However, this one is completely special from the others around town. Anyways there were a lot people during lunchtime! (of course, its IFC!). The service here was very good although it's a bit confused for us having a server in Starbucks. The staff even helped us to find a table!!The food choice is much more than other Starbucks. I can even find a lot of hot food selection, such as mushroom soup, vegetable lasagna, pastries, make-to-order salads and the usual cakes and breads. We took Lasagne alla Bolognese and English cottage pie, both of them were tasted with nice presentation given its from Starbuck!!00"", '0 I like this Starbucks shop which has been decorated like a cozy French bistro (complete with some ""outdoor"" seats, which are great for both work and chit-chat). And this is the first Starbucks outlet in Hong Kong to offer hot food items, apart from the usual fare you see in other Starbucks branches around town. Hot food selection 0Hot food selection All items are a la carte but there are ""Barista\'s Recommendations"" for some possible pairings of food and soup for example (sorry, no discounts for such combos). So I chose one of these combinations of Wild Mushroom Soup ($34) + Slow Roasted Vegetable Lasagna ($62) = $96. I made my order at the counter, picked my seat in the dining area, and the barista would bring me my order in a moment. No more crazy table-hunting with food and drinks in my hands!Dining area0Dining areaNice & Neat0Nice & NeatThe Wild Mushroom Soup was essentially cream of mushroom soup, but much better than the canned variety of course. Bursting with the aroma of mushrooms, yet warm and creamy, this soup, together with the complimentary Olive Bread was a delightful start of a hearty meal. 0As for the Slow Roasted Vegetable Lasagna, there were lots of refreshing veggies like spinach, zucchini and bell peppers layered between sheets of lasagna pasta. Topped with baked cheese and drizzled with a tomato basil sauce, the pasta was aromatic, wholesome, filling yet palate-pleasing. 1No visit to Starbucks is complete without a coffee. I rounded my meal up with a Espresso Macchiato ($15) which was a dab of milk foam more than the usual espresso shot. In the picture the foam had already sunken...but with such a slight hint the flavor of the coffee was not much affected.0Admittedly the price tags for the hot food items are a bit hefty (but still reasonable by Central standards), it seems that this Starbucks @ ifc has become an all-time favorite for the A-grade office workers nearby. One minor drawback though, the staff can often get too tied up to tidy up the tables due to the shop\'s popularity and high turnover rate of patrons.', 'Starbucks @ IFC just moved from the first floor to this 2nd floor location.

The seasoning is quite good but the beef wasnt of that high quality  Maybe should try the wagyu version instead?!000', 'Havent been doing food hunting with my mom for a while and decided to give her a new steak experience. The real reason behind is, of course, that I really wanted to try out this deep fried beef cutlet The interior is cozy and not so well lit. With English pop songs playing in the background, the ambience is even more relaxing. Many young couples visited even though when it was already 2pm. Guess it is a popular dating spot? 0The menu is rather small but I am fine with it as long as they get their food right. Their focus is on beef but you can still grab lamb chop and fish as your main with a few other side dishes. You can pair your meat with some red wine, beer, cocktail, sake or even whisky. Very thoughtful of the owner to have included so many types of alcohol in the menu. 00I did my research as always and ordered a deep fried beef cutlet set that comes with an appetiser, salad and rice and a chicken bones dumplings as a side dish. The set looked pretty impressive with the nicely laid out beef slices, mini frying pan on a stove, tofu, salad and rice. 0Tofu and salad were light and refreshing, perfect items to make me feel healthy. The beef cutlet was lightly fried in katsu style with the inside still raw so that customers can control the degree of doneness to their liking. Love that crispy outer layer and tender juicy flesh inside. Some bits of the beef were sinewy but the overall quality is unexpectedly high considered its only $188 for the whole set.000Chicken bones dumplings were a tad too oily but I enjoyed that extra chewy/crunchy texture from those tiny bones.0It is worth mentioning that the waitress there was incredibly friendly and helpful throughout the meal. She proactively recommended dishes and provided extra cutlery and bowls even before I asked . Cant complain at all when I got such great service and a reasonably priced meal with premium beef.

To deep fry a steak in a thin layer of panko but yet it was not chewy. To sear it for a few seconds on a hibachi grill just for color sent my world to another planet. It was amazing and since then, I've been obsessed with gyukatsu.I found that Steak Bar served something like this so I wanted to give it a try. Originally located in Central, it later moved to Causeway Bay's Tang Lung Street. A location much closer to where I live so I came here for lunch.Menu is in English and Chinese. The come in sets that all include salad, rice and appetizer. Along with gyukatsu, they also have regular steak, lamb and even fish.00Ordering is in the form of checking off a piece of paper. Chinese on one side, English on the other side.0I wanted to get the gyukatsu so I chose set D (deep fried beef cutlet) for $188. They have option of wagyu but it was for $278 but it was American wagyu and clearly not the same. So, I stuck with the regular beef. It all arrived on a try with a hot habachi grill that had a slab of butter on it. A bit different than the one I had in Tokyo where they didn't add butter. It was just a bit of oil.0You get two pieces of steak. A pretty good portion size.0I plopped it on the grill. The panko coating was a lot thicker than the one I had in Japan but then that place is pretty famous. The steak was a decent quality and wasn't chewy when I ate it. It came with a tiny dish of yakiniku sauce and a bunch of salt on the other end. It was pretty good.0The rice was topped with a lot of furikake. I have no idea why there was so much. Or why they added it in the first place as it detracted from tasting the steak when I had some rice. I love furikake (I have so many packs at home!) but this was clearly not needed here. That is something I always appreciate about the Japanese. They will always server plain white rice with out fear so the focus is on the protein.0There was a bit of salad. It had a bit too much salad dressing. It was literally drowning in it.0The appetizer was a cube o tofu with grainy sesame sauce. Fairly forgettable.0It was ok. Not the best I've ever had but it was not too bad considering the price range. My return again as I saw they have a coupon on Openrice for free ice cream.

658,Stefanos Homemade Italian American Cuisine,Wan Chai,Italian,2.3,75.0,,"This restaurant doesn't look very Hong Kong to me: a black plastic banner as the shop sign, dark red walls but light grey carpet that will look more appropriate in the office, terrace-type wooden furniture, a hard bench on the wall side with a sharp edge that scrapes your thighs, one or two pictures from italian films and ornaments that look out of place - the deco was an odd mish-mash and I thought I was on the set of Top Chef restaurant challenge lol. They use a very small home-style coffee machine, a cute sight but a further hint of their amateurism which is also starkly borne out in other aspects as I saw. Back to the food: we only had a choice of pasta, and it was either a meaty bolgonese or the vegetarian variety. The pizza had already sold out - the place is tiny, but at 1 pm they have already sold out one of the main items on the set lunch menu lol - a sign of poor kitchen management maybe? First bad sign.As I would rather have pasta anyway, I wasn't disappointed and ordered the carnivorous penne. My 2 lunch companions also ordered pasta, but strangely enough, one of them arrived first even before the appetizer salads. Second bad sign.As the waitress brought over the one solitary plate of pasta, she told us that the salads would arrive later, but it seems she wasn't quite aware (or cared) that it was the wrong way to do things, but she was not unfriendly. Third bad sign. It took at least another 10 minutes before the other 2 pastas arrived - fourth bad sign. Why brought out the first one so early? If it had been a wrong order then it could have waited in the oven in the kitchen and served together with the other 2 pastas. Only serving one dish out of a party or 3 customers could only point to inept service and a cock-up in the kitchen.For desserts, some tables had both tiramisu and ice cream, but we were not asked what we liked and were served chocolate ice cream all round. Drinks took another 10 minutes to arrive, and as befor they didn't come altogether, even though I saw the younger waitress flaffing around the bar table with cups and stuff. Finally it was 2 pm and we had to flag down the equally clueless older waitress to do things on the double. In terms of the food (gosh I almost forgot to mention this lol) things were ok, the bolognese was made with tomato paste and did not have a lot of oil in it, and the pasta was cooked al dente. The portion was a bit meagre though. The leafy salad was quite ok as well, and the ice cream probably Dreyer's chocolate cake(?) The food does have promise, but they must realise that homey is one thing, but lackadaisical and inefficient service is quite another.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/wan-chai-stefanos-homemade-italian-american-cuisine/32328?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

It was quite enjoyable watching the chef cook for us, like the way he sprinkled sugar and added sauce onto the food. Maybe most of the cost of the meal really went to the service of the chef. But when he was cooking towards the end, the sukiyaki pot spilt out some sauce onto my face and blouse. It was ok.

The potato noodles didn't taste particularly good as they didn't absorb the sauce well. It was really quite disappointing.6th bowl: shoulder06th bowl: shoulderThe shoulder gave a much richer taste of beef than rib eye and sirloin. The greens were so pretty with a nicely tied knot. Still the beef was not comparable to those we recently ate in Tokyo...Miso soup0Miso soupThe best thing about this was the tofu cubes at the bottom.7th bowl: udon with beef & eggs07th bowl: udon with beef & eggsWe could choose between rice and udon. Of course we went for the udon. The chef cooked udon first and then beef pieces with our leftover eggs to make the toppings. The udon looked really nice with the toppings.

Again, it was not comparable to those sukiyaki noodles we ate in Tokyo.Green tea ice cream0Green tea ice creamThe ice cream was ok.Hot lemon water0Hot lemon waterWe asked for hot lemon water (they didn't offer cold drinks) instead of coffee.Overall, I would say this set was quite pricey at $580 + 10% considering the quality of the beef and the portion. I had expected better quality of the beef and sukiyaki itself (although my expectation could have been too high given our recent amazing sukiyaki experience in Tokyo).

Maybe the quality of these beef slices was not so good, I found them not so up-to-standard because they totally lacked the taste of beef and they were just too fatty. The beef couldn\'t offer a rich flavour of the sukiyaki soup base either although I had tried to soak the beef into the soup. Maybe should have soaked them for longer, despite the risk of overcooking the beef.0However, I had to admit that the presentation looked very appealing!Raw Egg0Raw EggThe egg was very good, offering a strong egg flavour which smelt so good and was so smooth. Could tell that it was imported from Japan. It looked so pretty and the egg yolk was a bit hard to break.Vegetables & Udon0Vegetables & UdonThere were some veggies and udon underneath the beef. The vegetables tasted much better than the beef, well absorbing the sukiyaki soup base. The mushrooms, in particular, tasted really delicious which were so sweet and went along well with the soup base. The udon was so smooth too! I wish there were more udon.Rice0RiceCould tell that the rice should be imported from Japan as well. They were quite moist which I really liked although I normally don\'t like rice. So generous that they were willing to give you more when asked.Miso soup was served really really hot! Great for the low temperature! Nothing special about the pickles.Strawberry Ice-cream0Strawberry Ice-creamAlthough not specified on the menu, ice-cream was offered to end the meal. It was really appreciated because I\'m such an ice-cream lover. The bowl and the spoon were kept cold to serve the ice-cream. This strawberry ice-cream tasted good, although less smooth and yummy than my favourite Haagen Dazs ice-cream and there were some ice cubes inside unfortunately.In short, should have ordered the Sukiyaki Set instead to satisfy my Sukiyaki desire.

BBQ pork delicious. We also ordered the shrimp dumplings, the pork dumplings, spring rolls etc. The crispy rice cake was delicious, very special crispy bun inside the rice cake. We also ordered 3 dishes, the bitter melon with tofu, fried milk with scallop and fried rice. Oh my goodness, they came in super large portion which we were all so shocked and we had to take away most of them LOL The service was good. The waiters were generally ok.', 'I went here quite a number of years ago and did not return until my colleague booked here since nowhere else was available. You could order most dim sum according to how many people you have. First came the glutinous rice chicken wrapped with lotus leaf. It looked slightly smaller than your average glutinous rice chicken. I didn\'t try it since it was snapped up by my efficient colleagues.  They told me that it was average. Then came the rice roll with shrimps. The three rice rolls were quite thick and tasted a bit like soap. The shrimps inside were big and quite crisp but were completely tasteless. It was at this point that I decided to start taking photos. The xiao mai came and looked liked this:The Xiao Mai of Pisa  0The Xiao Mai of Pisa  Certainly part of the price in these sort of restaurants would be for the interior decoration (nice), service (which was fine) and how the food looked like. But as you could see from the photo, this did not look good. Well, neither did it taste good. The xiao mai were lukewarm, the pork was nothing special, the scallops weren\'t too fresh and just tasted a bit like seawater. Then came the shrimp dumplings and the fried turnip cakes:OK .0OK .To be perfectly fair, the turnip cake was quite interesting. It was fried with some chilli and garlic. Quite an interesting idea. However, the turnip cake was crispy outside but quite dry inside. The result was a bit like a hash brown made with taro, if you know what I mean.The shrimp dumplings were, unfortunately, a bit similar to the rice rolls. The rice pastry was a bit better - at least it didn\'t taste like soap - and was quite chewy. But the shrimps were similarly bland.Then came the chicken with spicy sauce:Courtesy of Jack D. Ripper. - 0Courtesy of Jack D. Ripper. - This was how it looked like.  The presentation, namely, the oddly placed decapitated chicken head with slices of skins falling apart with no garnishing, is acceptable for a small local eatery or dai pai dong but not for a 5 star hotel restaurant. (I just double checked - this restaurant was actually recommended by Michelin 2011   )The chicken was tender enough but the sauce tasted like the common Thai sweet chilli sauce you could buy in any supermarket. For example:Then the Chinese kale with ginger sauce:OK0OKThis was the best dish of all. The Chinese kale was quite fresh and crisp. However, we could barely taste any ginger sauce. It was OK though. The Fu Jian fried rice:so-so 0so-so A Fu Jian (name of a province in China) fried rice usually consists of shrimps, chopped Chinese kale, duck and pork with quite a lot of sauce. Once again, the shrimps were not fresh and the duck tasted a bit ""off"" (a bit sour - i.e. not fresh). The rice was fine. I really wanted to leave as soon as possible but we still ordered desserts. I ordered an almond with sesame soup, which, according to traditional Chinese wisdom, is very good for health.  Rorschach test0 Rorschach testI\'m usually not too fussed about food presentation but like what I\'ve mentioned to you already, this is a 5 star hotel restaurant recommended by Michelin. I\'m not sure how to make of the pattern in my dessert. Is it supposed to be a failed Tai Chi pattern? A painting ? Calligraphy? Or was it not supposed to be anything other than to show that a spoonful of almond paste was placed on top? If that\'s the case, I\'d prefer they mix it properly so it wouldn\'t look that messy.The bill -  HK$260 each person for lunch.

Sun King Yuen is famous for their signature Curry Pork Chop Rice and Stir Fried Beef Flat Noodles.Lunch hours are mad crazy here at Sun King Yuen Curry. Since there is no system for dine in waiting or for take away orders, everyone just stands and blocks the front door in case the reception lady forgets them. To be totally honest, I truly admire the lady's strong memory although I hate how the system works in here. In the end, she did remember me and I got sit pretty soon.2Stir fried Kway Teow ()For those who have dined here before should have known how insanely oily their stir fried beef flat noodles is, so we opt for stir fried Kway Teow () instead. Totally trying our luck, the Kway Teow turned out to be as oily as f. Despite the shiny coat, the Kway Teow was actually pretty nice in strong taste with mild spiciness. The barbecue pork (cha siu) was on the lean side but was savoury and tender. There was also prawns, bean sprouts and green onions on the dish. I felt really disgusted after finishing the dish as I probably had 5 table spoons of cooking oil from this kway teow.

Mine took a while to be served as they were fresh from deep frying wok. The bowl of yellow curry was served slightly earlier with a drooling aroma. A piece of potato sat in the middle of the curry sauce, looking pathetic but delicious.Curry Pork Chop Rice0Curry Pork Chop RiceThe curry sauce was strongly flavoured, creamy and on the sweet side. It was not too spicy and somehow got a bit of bitterness with it. The pork chop was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The parts with evil fats were the most delicious parts. The rice was pretty disappointing, they were a bit too hard for me and many sticked together in a ball.Curry Pork Chop Rice0Curry Pork Chop RiceMilk TeaI had a glass of Canto Milk Tea to go with my strongly flavoured dishes. This milk tea was quite smooth and had a full body. I don't drink Canto Mill Tea very often, I don't know what is good, but this is not bad.Milk Tea0Milk TeaAs you can probably see from the picture, the portion at Sun King Yuen is gigantic.

The beef brisket was quite tender and the rice was fragrant (I take my rice very seriously).  While the curry was quite tasty it was nothing spectacular.  What was spectacular was the portion of my mates' pork chop with curry sauce.  Huge.

All include a salad and miso soup. If you are not interested in the lunch menu, they have a la carte available where you can order a rice bowl and add $20 for salad and soup. The a la carte menu is nicely designed in that it not only lists the ingredients in the bowl but also gives a photo of it. No more wondering what the item looks like anymore!0I ordered the Hoikkaido seafood rice bowl ($208) lunch set. It came served on a stylish wooden tray making it feel like I was eating in Muji Cafe.0The donburi was not very big but it was a decent size for me. Unsure about those who have bigger appetites. It included scallop, sea urchin, crab leg, hamachi, chu toro, salmon roe and slices of pickled daikon. The sashimi was fresh and was of a decent quality. I loved especially the toro as it literally melted in my mouth. The rice was seasoned lightly with a hint of vinegar.0The salad had bits of tofu and a sesame salad dressing was used. It tasted alright. The greens were fresh and crispy.0Miso soup was your average miso soup though I did note they did use a dashi broth instead of what most places do: dilute miso paste with water.0A great single people eating establishment where the quality of the sashimi was pretty decent for a reasonable price. Though for this price, you could probably find better deals at lunch in other Japanese restaurants in Causeway Bay.

Also with the toppings on the sushi, they will mix with those which gave better flavour.0However, I was quite disappointed with the sushi order and the portion was too small even I don't eat much for lunch.0So then I ordered a tuna hand-roll at the end."", ""I had some business in Wanchai today, and decided to try this new sushi restaurant based on the positive reviews on OpenRice.As I was not overly hungry, and wish to have a combination of hot and cold foods, I decided to try the sushi and chicken udon set. I sat at the sushi counter, and informed the chef of my dietary preference, which he immediately acknowledged.The meal began with two small appetizers, including a sashimi salad and an egg custard. The sashimi salad included three small pieces of raw fish, which tasted as if it had been pre-cut and kept refrigerated. The pieces of green lettuce in the salad were not delicately cut to compliment the small pieces of fish, and the soy-based dressing was rather carelessly drizzled on top. While the egg custard was smooth, the dish was served at lukewarm temperature and was not memorable.The most perplexing thing was the order in which the main dishes were presented.Each piece of sushi was served individually, one after the other, as the chef waited until I had finished each piece.However, after only two pieces of sushi, the small bowl of hot chicken udon arrived at the table. I was very surprised but did not make any comments to the staff. As I did not wish for the noodles to soften too much, I ate the chicken udon before any other sushi. The sushi chef had also seen the arrival of the chicken udon, and he waited until I had finished before preparing the third piece of sushi.The remainder of the sushi were also offered in an unusual order, with an egg omelet sushi arriving fifth, and the uni sushi arriving as the last piece. In Japan, the order in which sushi is presented begins with the mildest, freshest, most delicate flavours, before progressing onto grilled items, and finally completing with egg omelet or rolls. During my meal, several pieces of seafood did not adhere to the rice properly, and separated as I transferred the piece of sushi to my small plate. In addition, the flavours of the sushi were not well-balanced, with more than half the pieces being overdressed with sauce and hiding the quality of the ingredient. It is rare, if ever, that I have felt so over-umami'ed after only eight pieces of sushi.This combination of mixing hot and cold foods, and having the sushi presented in a peculiar order, made me unusually full and I declined the cucumber roll and ice cream dessert.From arriving at the restaurant to the end of the meal, all staff encountered were courteous and efficient. The restaurant was about half full throughout the time I dined there, the ambiance was quiet and the seating was comfortable. The lack of attention to detail unfortunately detracted from what otherwise would have been a praise-worthy experience."", ""I always have this struggle during lunchtime  where to find nice sushi in Wanchai? I am a die-hard fan of Japanese food, but when the question comes, it makes me realize its indeed difficult to find a decent Japanese restaurant in this office-packed jungle. Then there comes a day after work that I randomly stroll past this new sushi place, Sushi Jun. You wouldnt be surprised that I immediately decided to give it a try the next day with my colleague, and Im glad it did not disappoint. Heard the resto was managed by a famous chef who was in charge of Grand Hyatts Kaetsu before  no wonder why.Here is what I ordered, the Omakase Nigiri Sushi set (HK$450) which consists of 12 kinds of sashimi and sushi, including toro, sea urchin, sea eel, flounders porch, needle fish, leather jacket fish with liver sauce, striped jack and scallop. The sashimi is so fresh and smooth that it literally slides down your throat in one gulp, and the flavor is so strong that it still remained in my mouth even after I swallowed the entire piece of fish. The thickness of every piece of sashimi is overwhelming  which makes the lunch set totally worth the price.Sea urchin sushi1Sea urchin sushiSeared Toro sushi0Seared Toro sushiSea eel sushi0Sea eel sushiSeared Flounder's porch sushi0Seared Flounder's porch sushiNeedle fish0Needle fishleather jacket fish with liver sauce0leather jacket fish with liver sauceStriped jack sushi0Striped jack sushiScallop with sea urchin sushi0Scallop with sea urchin sushiGrated wasabi0Grated wasabiMy colleague ordered the tempura set (HK$150).

He wouldnt let me speak and even argued with me when I was making a request...!

I had asked for the differences between this set and the $680 one Kuwamizu set before ordering and had been told that there would be no differences for the first 10 pieces. But I think I noticed that there were indeed some differences even for the appetizer. Anyway...Appetizer 1Appetizer We were swiftly served the appetizer by our chef.

He first took out a slice of crispy seaweed, then put some sushi rice on it, sprinkled some sesame, then spread the prepared chopped tuna already mixed with some yuzu(?) onto the roll with mint leaf and rolled it. There were so many different layers of texture while chewing it but unfortunately most of the flavour was mint which was too strong I think. Service was so good that the chef waited for my lunch partner to finish his phone call before starting to make him the roll. (salt & )0 (salt & )Again it was so enjoyable watching him make this sushi. It was cut into 2 halves with the first half in front being sprinkled with salt and wasabi to be eaten first and the latter with sea eel sauce to be eaten second. The one with salt was a bit salty and the one with sea eel sauce could have been less salty if I hadn\'t dipped it into more sea eel sauce ! The sea eel itself was nothing special though.1The egg in front tasted less strong and was recommended to be eaten first before the one at the back which was more sweet. They were ok.Miso Soup0Miso SoupMiso Soup0Miso SoupThe miso soup was quite good. It was concentrated enough and the taste was better than average I would say. The only complaint was the tiny portionPickled radish & 0Pickled radish & The pickled radish (at the back) were pretty fresh and I liked the thick cut.Green Tea Ice-cream0Green Tea Ice-creamWe had a choice over green tea ice-cream, yuzu sorbet or coffee. Both of us went for the green tea ice-cream. It was ok.Overall, I think the food quality was pretty good although we didn\'t get to try more expensive sushi because we ordered the cheapest set.The portion seemed reasonable too because we had too many experiences leaving a sushi bar having spent a fortune with our stomach still complaining! Having said that, my lunch partner seemed to prefer Sushi Ima which offered more special sushi at a similar cost.Service was really good. I would say it offered the best service out of all those sushi bars I had visited in Central. The chef kept refilling our sliced ginger. The servers kept cleaning our tableware, even though there was just 1 rice grain left on the table. The chef also saw us off at the lift lobby after we had checked out. Quite a nice dining experience overall.', '5th October 2017. It was an amazing experience to have omakase lunch at Sushi Shin, a newly opened sushi restaurant on On Lan Street. We went in a group of three. And we ordered the 12 pieces nigiri sets. It turned out all the nigiri were up to a premium standard and precisely made! 1- Marinated octopus in Japanese soy sauce. Its a very refreshing piece to start our dining experience with! The octopus taste so fresh with a well balanced flavour of the custom made sauce, it was tender, sweet with a nice bit of crunch and crackle with each bite. Its definitely a nice opening dish.2- Steamed egg with salmon roes topping. It was a perfect match, the sweetness of the egg engaged well with the salmon roes.3- Karei |  It was a mild flavour white fish to start with, light and tasty with a sweet after taste.4- Kinmetai |  Chef has slightly seared the surface/skin of the fish, its fattiness and oil enriched the tasting experience of having this piece!5- Chutoro | The Chutoro nigiri was strong, juicy, fatty and sweet! Wild toro has a slightly richer flavour than normal tuna, with an enhanced after taste.6- Siro ebi | It was so fresh and sweet! As you all know I will never take prawns in my life, but after Adachi san introduced this piece to me.. I have definitely got a completely different perspective towards ebi. I love the after taste!7- Hotatekai | The hotatekai nigiri was so tender and fresh. It has been a while since I had fresh hotatekai!8- Aji | Chopped ginger and the sauce enriched Aji. The skilful kiss-cuts on the back of the fish enhanced the texture of the piece!9- Kohada | Kohada is always a signature sushi of Tokyo Edomae sushi. It has been seasoned with salt and marinated in rice vinegar before it was served. It taste slightly lighter than other shops I personally think, but still very nice.10- Kinki | Special treat from the head chef, the kinki was so soft and juicy, its skin was crunchy and rich! The marinated radish went so well with the fish with a slight sour flavour, definitely brought it to another level!11- Maguro | Marinated tuna with homemade soy sauce. The sauce married so well with the tuna, its less fat but yet tender. I like it long lasting after taste!12- Wild Salmon | It was one of the highlight of the day. Chef has aged the salmon for a day, marinated it in customised soy sauce and slightly smoked it with Sakura wood! It was definitely a surprise for me how good salmon can be. The treatment made it unique and outstanding! Its texture was so soft and smooth, its flavour was rich and ever better with a fine touch of woodiness from Sakura wood.13- Uni | Hokkaido uni marinated in between seaweed. The uni became much more delicate and it has fully engaged with the flavour of the seaweed sauce. Its outstanding indeed.14- Tuna hand roll | The seaweed was so crispy, and the chopped fatty tuna was very juicy.15- Anago (sea salt) | Seared anago marked the end of the day. It was seasoned with sea salt. Its so soft that it melted in my mouth straight a way!16- Anago (soy sauce) | This was even better than the last piece! The sauce worked very well with the seared anago and its the perfect amount! Its awesome.17- Tamago | Homemade panna cotta by Chef Adachi. Very nice dessert to end this wonderful omakase! 000000000001'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-sushi-kami/544358?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
677,Sushi Kou,Causeway Bay,Japanese,3.8,360.0,0.0,"Causeway Bay has the largest number of restaurants that open at a rapid rate. There is always so much to choose from. As I live near by, I always try something new for lunch from time to time. On this day, I decided to try out a new sushi restaurant called Sushi Kou. Located in a building called Aura on Pennington (which happens to have a lot of other restaurants), the restaurant isn't very big. There are a few tables but majority of the seating is facing the rather large central sushi bar. Of course, I sat at the sushi bar!During lunch time, they have a lunch set menu. Menu is in English and Japanese. All sets come with a salad, chawanmushi, udon, soup and dessert.1As I had a craving for sushi, I ordered the 9 piece sushi plus cut roll omakase set for $328.The meal started off with a salad. Simple with crunchy greens and a light Japanese style Italian dressing with a slight yuzu taste.0Then the chef presented me with their pickles. Or more like a generous plate of pickled ginger. Actually, these were not sliced thinly like most places but diced into chunks. The ginger taste was not too strong which I liked but it was still present.0And then the sushi began! The rice was a good consistency. The fish was fresh.0000This was a highlight. Diced sweet shrimp with a bit of uni with a bit of shiso. A great combination of textures and taste! The sweetness of the shrimp along with the gooey texture was wonderful. Combine that with the sharp uni taste, this was definitely a favorite.0We paused for chawanmushi. The egg custard was smooth and savory. I found some fish meat inside as well.0Then the sushi continued.00Another highlight was this one. Soy sauce marinated tuna. It wasn't too salty to cover the taste of the tuna. But still enough to give it that extra level.0I also adored this. Tamagoyaki two ways. On the left was with truffle which was ok. I wasn't as blown away by that. The one on the right was a sweet version and looked like a castella cake as it was caramelized on the top. Combined together, it was a balance of sweet and savory. Two extreme egg combinations.0The maki roll was a nice finish to the meal.1The set also included a mini udon (and it is very mini). The noodles were smooth and chewy. The broth had a light taste.0The set also came with a miso soup that was packed with flavor. I also found a clam as well.0The dessert was ice cream. That day it was either pumpkin or cheese. I chose cheese and I didn't regret. It was like eating frozen cheesecake.0A great new addition to the many sushi restaurants in Causeway Bay. Especially during lunch time as competition is stiff. Staff was courteous and inviting. Would definitely come again and perhaps try out the 12 piece omakase set or one of their other meals sets.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-sushi-kou/631128?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

A bit of lettuce, corn and cherry tomatoes with a drizzle of sesame salad dressing. It was alright as salads go.0The steamed egg had a thick layer of clear broth which I found annoying as it made the steamed egg more watery than usual.0The miso soup was ok.

I'm unsure why wasabi was added to the side as the pieces already had wasabi in them.0The dessert was piece of chocolate cake.

It was when the male manager came over to ask us to eat faster to finish on time in a very rude manner. It really ruined the whole dining experience to be honest. I appreciated his reminder but he should have really delivered the message in a much softer way. I felt like I was scolded. When we asked for our desserts to check out, the manager didn't offer us any choice while we heard that the customers next to us got to choose between the yuzu sorbet and yoghurt mousse offered by another server. It took quite a long time for him to serve us the desserts which was done after checking out our bills too.

You get to choose 8 pieces of sushi plus 1 roll.  Toro, uni, turbot, sweet shrimp and salmon roe are highly recommended.  The set came with salad, steamed egg, ice-cream and coffee too.Salad was fresh and steamed egg was super smooth with no air bubble at all.  I've been a regular customer for years.  It was run by a Japanese manager in the past and service was consistently good.  You would feel that you are eating in a restaurant in Japan with good food, service and environment.  Now it's run by a local Hong Kong manager and service has deteriorated a lot.  He's always in a rush and his attitude is blunt.  He would make you feel not at ease.  The whole experience was downgraded to become like eating in any other regular local  Hong Kong restaurants.

687,Sushi To by Harlan Goldstein,Causeway Bay,Japanese,2.1,350.0,0.0,"Visited this place for lunch as I've always been interested in their semi lunch buffet concept. Prior to visiting, I had no expectations of this restaurant as I've heard mixed reviews, mainly negative but still decided to come and verify myself.Upon arriving, getting seated was a breeze. Decor was fair and the staff were friendly. I decided to order the deluxe wild 7 kinds sashimi selection while my two guests ordered the miso grilled cod and terriyaki beef set.On with the buffet section. The selection was a little lacking. There were about 10 items to choose from(excluding dessert and fruits) and salads took up 3 already. I definitely saw some items I dont normally see in a buffet like takoyaki and ramen. There were other standard items like teppanyaki fish, tempura and sushi. The quality of the items were between subpar and fair(very difficult to mess up salad). There was nothing done particularly well, though there were a few dishes that were really not good. The ramen was horrible. They have little cups of ramen noodles with some condiments inside and you just had to pour the soup in which was kept warm in a chafing dish. The key word to look out for is warm. It was just a little warmer than body temperature and the texture of the noodle was horrible. The noodle would fall apart with very little pressure applied, there was no biting texture to it unlike some of the other items which I will get into shortly. The tempura fish cake was done poorly too. The batter is still wet in the middle. On with the main course. Presentation was good. The steak was done well. No complaints the flavor and the meat were quite good. The flavoring of the cod was done ok, however it didnt feel very fresh. The texture was tough.Now my Deluxe wild 7 kinds sashimi selection... horrible. I do not expect quality of this kind from a restaurant like this.. or any restaurant as a matter of fact. It was not fresh at all. All the fish I had were quite fishy. I could get better quality from any chain conveyor belt restaurant. The sashimi was served way too chilled, in some of the items it felt like the middle of it was a bit icy, like chewing on a slushie. Texture of the items... now as I was saying previously about the ramen texture, the fish were quite the opposite. The texture was like chewing on rubber, no kidding. The uni, luckily wasnt bitter, but thats about it. There was no taste to it, it could have been anything. The scallop, was very interesting. This may be the first time I've had scallop that had texture to it. It wasn't soft and when I bit into it, it was a little tough. Now the best part, fatty tuna. It wasn't soft, it didnt melt in my mouth, I had to bite into it and the flavor? Missing. It should have been called Tuna fat instead. The shrimp was probably the least unsatisfactory and I would give it an OK only. It was botan shrimp but not sweet at all. It was lacking in flavor which would have been good if it was applied to the fish sashimi which many tasted VERY fishy. The amberjack and what I suspected as saury were as I mentioned, very rubbery and fishy in taste, to the point I felt sick. Finishing it was very difficult and I had to beg my other two guests to take some of my items from me, which they did, unwillingly.What came with the set was steamed egg and miso soup. Miso soup very standard nothing to talk about while the egg didnt taste like anything.Service from the manager there was very good. He came to ask us how things were and made sure we were tended to. However, the person serving our table was not very good. He seemed lost and seems to not know what his job is. The manager on many occasions had to tell him to pick up the finished plates on our table and to give us more tea.Overall, I do not recommend this restaurant. I should have listened my friends who suggested against it. Much better Japanese food can be found at ANY price point around the area so look else where if you want to have an at least decent lunch.

Was advised to try out the 12 piece sushi set which comes out to roughly hkd300 a person after service charge which is quite a bargain in this town for decent sushi. Was not too big of a fan of the restaurant setting as it was dimly lit and the airconditioning was a bit too strong as we were sitting at the end of the sushi counter right underneath the air conditioning. Service was average although they could improve in cleaning up items placed behind the counter (eg saw quite a few containers and boxes clutterring up the workspace behind the sushi counter). Sushi set comes with 12 pieces picked by the chef, small salad, steamed egg and a small bowl of udon noodles). No soy sauce or wasabi is given as the rice itself is premarinated, which was fine by me. However, quite a few pieces of sushi, including the mackeral, had a strong fishy taste and was definitely not fresh. Some of the pieces had a slight vinegary taste which was fine but the fishiness of several pieces definitely killed my dining experience.

691,Suzuike Japanese Cuisine,Wan Chai,Japanese,3.7,250.0,0.0,"Another hidden treasure we came upon with as we explore the neighborhood around our new apartment in Wan Chai near the Convention Center!  Suzuike is located in the mall in a quiet corner with a sleek and subtle entrance.  I have a growing fondness for quiet and subtle restaurant nowadays as it seems that these restaurants tend to put more focus on what's important - the FOOD! obviously and often also the experience for the customer.  Well  I must admit that I sometimes enjoy the glitz and glam of a fancy upscale and sometimes slightly pretentious restaurant but then a casual dining experience is often more enjoyable especially when you just want to enjoy a good meal without having to worry about using the right fork for the dish!  Anyways, so back to Suzuike.... we went for lunch on a Saturday and the restaurant was rather empty, there were only us and 1 other table. There's also a private room with a nice view of the outside streets layered with greens from the trees right outside (restaurant is located on the 2nd floor of the mall so it's not high up!) The decor is nothing to write home about but it is simple, chic and sleek.  They offer various lunch set featuring Sashimi set, Sushi set, Wagyu Beef Terriyaki, Beef Udon set, etc.  Slightly on the expensive side (Sashimi set was around $250, and Beef was 150+) but it is justified by its high quality and reasonable portion.  I ordered the Sashimi set and there's not one piece on my plate that doesn't leave me wanting more!  Everything was super fresh and tasty!    My hubby ordered the Wagyu beef terriyaki and requested for it to be medium rare and it was cooked to perfection!  Beef was flavoursome and tender with a perfectly pink/red center!  Friends who have been to Suzuike have all highly recommended the Truffle Somen but we were not hungry enough to order on top of our lunch set, so we will just have to go back to another visit and we are looking forward to the experience!The staff were friendly and attentive without being annoying (nothing worse than that!). They also seem very knowledgeable on their menu, kindly offer recommendation on the day's special - oysters flown in from Japan, and fresh Uni, etc.All in all, a very nice dining experience and as mentioned, we will be visiting again!""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/wan-chai-suzuike-japanese-cuisine/50965?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

The tofu shaped like tiny drums were amazing, and I love the shrimp sauce fried rice. The desserts aren't spectacular, but the appetizer and mains are. Unlike many other Thai restaurants around town, this place doesn't put too much sugar in their sauces, which is perfect for me.Our kids love this place because if you get a place by the window, you can climb up and watch the people and cars in the busy street below."", ""This has been my all-time favorite Thai restaurant in Hong Kong in the past 10 years. The menu offers a huge range of choices and it is difficult to order something that disappoints. Almost every new dish I try is consistently kept to a high standard, and a few exceptional, memorable dishes are what keep me, my family and my friends coming back.Grilled Squid with Lime Sauce- Don't confuse this with grilled squid without the lime sauce. This is a little bit on the spicy side, but I've been unable to replicate this dish at home. Certainly worth a try. The squid meat is also extremely tender and we just love the sauce that goes with it. Around $158.Tom Yum Kung Soup (with Seafood)- This is one of the best I've found across all of the Thai restaurants in Hong Kong, including those in Kowloon City. Very coconut-y, not overly oily, with excellent use of herbs and a very generous helping of seafood ingredients. Around $60-$70 per serving.Curry Prawns (Dry)- Go for the dry curry prawns--they're huge, the curry is absolutely delicious (could go with rice), and the prawns are incredibly juicy. Similar for the curry crab, although that would not recommended on a romantic date as it could get a little messy. Probably just under $200 for half a dozen king prawns.Coconut Baked Rice (with Seafood)- This one is a Thai version of melted cheese on carbs, except it's with a sweet coconut sauce. The sweet corns and peas go perfectly with the melted coconut cream. I just wish there was less rice and more of the coconut! Around $158.Pineapple Duck Breast- Juicy and succulent duck breast. If you like sweet and sour, this is a great dish. It's also served in a hollowed-out pineapple. Around $158.Grilled Pork Neck- The all-time must-order dish for everyone. Very affordable for the big portion and probably the best grilled pork neck you can find in Hong Kong. Around $118-$128.If you are a first-timer, I suggest you avoid the noodle dishes as they tend to be rather uninspired.Service cannot be better, but that could be because a lot of the attendants there recognize us and therefore always pay special attention to make sure we're happy.

Quite a large portion and the subtle heat was nice. HOWEVER, my colleagues ordered the steamed minced meat with salted egg and a baked Bolognese sauce with rice which were extremely bland. Enough for them to never come back. So its essentially a hit or a miss. To play it safe, just order the breakfast combo if youre not into the adventurous game!0', ""I have been to Swiss Cafe a number of times. It is tucked away down a side street off Queen's Road. There is usually a long wait for weekday lunch, but otherwise you should be able to walk straight in. The decor and service are both no frills, but perfectly acceptable for this type of place. The Cafe itself is also clean as far as I can see, but the drains outside the door can be a bit smelly. Don't let that put you off!I have always had the same thing, the barbecue pork tea set. I love this set at most places, but particularly at Swiss Cafe. They are much more generous with the meat than anywhere else I have been, and the portion sizes more generally are really big. The macaroni soup has a strong flavour which I prefer. I do thing the set would be better with scrambled eggs, but the fried eggs are very tasty and halfway to scrambled anyway, which is nice.The main reason I recommend this place is the price. $40 for a big meal + drink in the middle of Central is amazing. If you want something lighter you can get a sandwich for around $15!! I would go more often if not for the lunch queue.

Fish had a thin cripsy crust on the outside, but very tender and fresh inside. Toegether with raw onions-> BOOM.However raw onion was a bit too spicy for me , and the after taste wasnt so pleasant. gota pop a few breath-mints afterward. Haha.00Fish burger0Fish burger'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/wan-chai-teds-lookout/124320?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw
696,TEN ZUSHI,Causeway Bay,Japanese,4.6,550.0,0.0,"I was very happy and satisfied with the lunch set at Ten Zushi, which was priced at $500 + 10%. The ingredients were fresh, the tastes were special and satisfying, and the environment was comfortable. The service was great. The tofu salad was immediately served once we ordered. The greens were fresh and tasty. The egg custard with crabmeat was served straight after. The flavor was rich and there were plenty of crab meat! This is followed by the omakase sushi set. We had 6 pieces of sushi, an oyster, then another 6 pieces of sushi. My favourites were the Hokkaido cod sushi, the uni roll, and the seared toro sushi! The Hokkaido cod was fresh, raw, smooth and flavourful. The uni was abundant and sweet. The seared toro sushi was layered with sesame and some special ingredients which made it very unique and tasty! Then, the miso soup was served. Unlike the typical miso soup, it contained a lot of squid.Finally, the dessert - sea salt ice cream - was served. It was a satisfying end to the lunch set, sweet and salty at the same time. Overall I highly recommend Ten Zushi!0000000'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-ten-zushi/588421?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw
697,TENKAI,Central,Japanese,4.6,330.0,45.0,"Today I would like to show my friend the best tempura in town. So I bring them to Tenkai at Sheung Wan Aberdeen road.it is only twelve at noon, the shop is queue up with number of people, unbelievable!They provided Premium lunch set for Weekend -Four types of tempura lunch , including tenkai Ten-Don set, tempura lunch sets and tempura lunch special set, Ranges from $180-$300. The major difference between those lunch set is the number of tempura pieces served. Today I encores the Tempura lunch special set $300, 9 pieces of Japanese authentic tempura .The whole set comes with: Shrimp, sea urchin, white fish, conger eel, tenkai egg, Sakura shrimp and veggies (Includes soup , two appetizers and two free rice. )The weather is so hot today, and The iced green tea comes in the right moment ! It is from Shizuoka, the taste is so mild and smooth, with the cold ice, what a delightful healthy drink in summer.All the tempura is so good! Perfectly done!  I cant find any one of them I dont like. It is Served piece by piece. And All the seafood is freshly imported from Tsukuji market in japan! All The appetizers is quite tasty 11and the soup is light and refreshing.1First dish is shrimp tempura and white fish. 1Though the shrimp is not huge, but The shrimp is so fresh and the shrimp head is so crispy! Like it! The white fish is coated with a thin layer of batter, crispy outside and very soft inside, with light fish flavor. Now here comes a slightly stronger flavor - The conger eel . 1The eel got stronger taste and it is a bit firmer than the fish. The vegetable tempura is very nice too. 1This time I drip the veggies with salt Instead of tempura sauce. The apparatus is really tender and juicy, the lotus seed root is crisp and crunchy, and pumpkin tempura is so soft and sweet. Everyone of them got diverse texture and taste.And then here comes the highlight of the meal: sea urchin! 1The sea urchin tempura is so so sweet!! It is so creamy and soft , contrasting with a thin layer of batter, almost melts in my mouth completely! Love it!! . I also enjoy the tenkai egg a lot! 1Thats the other highlight of the meal. Not many restaurants do the tempura eggs, while this requires high level of skills. The tenkai egg is semi cooked, covered with extra thin layer of batter. I cut the egg into half, the orangey egg yolk just flows onto the rice. 1Mix it together with a bit of wasabi and tenkai sweet soy sauce , it is so creamy and rich. A bit creaminess, a bit of wasabi spiciness and a bit sweetness of the tenkai soy sauce. what a simple heavenly flavor! The Sakura shrimps tempura is the third and last highlight of the meal. 1The shrimps are so tiny , but with really strong shrimp flavor! Mix it together with the broth, seaweed and white rice, it becomes chazuke. 1The soup is so clear and smooth, with a hint of seafood taste, together with soften Sakura shrimps and seaweed, it is umami, tasty and moist, also a perfect ending for the seafood tempura meal. All of us really enjoy the meal. however the pace of serving tempura is too fast. One comes another non-stop. That may be due to lots of customers waiting outside, so the chef have to served the tempura really quick for another round. Anyway, I still enjoy the high quality of tempura here,  from the rhythm of light tastes tempura to strong taste tempura. I definitely will come back again for more.'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-tenkai/470394?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
698,TETSU,Causeway Bay,Japanese,3.8,116.0,0.0,"Ah...cooler weather brings me to one of my favorite comfort foods. Ramen. And luckily, new ramen shops always open up in Hong Kong for me to try along with my old favorites for me to revisit. I discovered a new ramen shop that was in the Causeway Bay area in a section I often walk by on my way to the wet market for groceries. The name? Tetsu. For foodie or ramen fans, the name will bring a lot of interest to the ever growing Hong Kong ramen scene. And one of those insane ramen fans is me. Because ramen, to me is not over priced instant noodles! So, I went on opening day!Tetsu is from yes... the land of ramen. Tokyo, Japan. Originally near Shinagawa station, they now have expanded to other areas of Tokyo and well..beyond. They are so popular, they have lines that can last for at least an hour. And what type of ramen do they serve? Tsukemen. Yes, the ramen where you dip away in a bowl of hot soup. However, when you eat tsukemen, there is one problem that is encountered. The soup goes cold after a while. What are you to do? Tetsu has solved this problem by popping you a hot stone into your soup to reheat it. Problem solved.The Hong Kong branch of Tetsu is located next to the Canal Road flyover where there is heavy foot traffic from people waiting to get on crossharbour buses. Fitting as it\'s located near a traffic bridge. However, when entering Tetsu Hong Kong, one glaring difference is noted. There is no vending machine to buy a ticket to order your ramen like they do in Japan. No. You sit down like at a regular ramen place, check off the menu items and pay later at the cashier.The check off menu is similar to all the other ramen shops in Hong Kong. It\'s in Chinese only. You choose what yiou want, how intense your soup and any extras. They have two sizes for your ramen for the same price: 200 g and 300 g. I chose 200 g and it was more than enough for a girl like me.3However, English readers ... don\'t be dismayed. They have a picture menu at each seat with photos, English and Chinese! They have two types of tsukemen. One is the regular type and the other is called atsumori. That is the nontradtional version where they will keep the ramen in a hot soup. For tradtionalists ... don\'t choose atsumori. Another thing that is different than the Japanese branch is they serve tonkatsu and sendagi ramen. The Japanese branch only serves tsukemen and that is it. No other ramen is served. I believe they may have added more items to please the Hong Kong market who are always demanding more variety in their menu.0They have a cute cartoon on how to eat tsukemen. You dip a few strands of ramen into your soup and eat away. When the soup gets cold, request a stone where your soup will bubble away while you ooh and ahh. After you are done your ramen, you request a hot dashi soup to dilute your dipping ramen and drink it up.0Condiments were simple and very typical in many other places. Cold ice water is available in a pitcher on each table.0Of course, being in a tsukemen specialist, I only order one thing and one thing only. I chose 200 g version, normal soup strength and normal chewiness of the noodle. Price: $89. I was informed that it may take 10 minute wait time.Soup was thick and very rich in chicken and fish stock. It\'s also very salty and perfect for dipping.0The noodles were thick and chewy. There was no starchy after taste. Product of a good rinsing by the ramen chef. I read somewhere they use a noodle that is a blend of buckwheat and udon flour. I don\'t know if that makes for a better ramen noodle but this was pretty good all around.0The ramen does include bamboo shoots and char siu but it does not include an egg. Egg is an extra $9. However, I wanted an extra round of char siu so this was an extra $29 for a set that includes extra char siu, bamboo shoots and egg. The char siu was interesting. It was sliced in thick strips and not slices like other places. It was tender and had a very sweet taste of Chinese five spices.0The egg was perfection. The yolk flowed beautifully like lava. The egg was slightly marinated but not too much.0After a while, my soup got a bit cold and I asked for a hot stone. The staff will bring a hot stone to your table and ask you to place your metal spoon on a small dish. They will lay the stone on to your spoon and tell you to slowly put it into your soup. Wait for it to bubble and then cover it up with your spoon.Of course, I played the ""OMG....I\'m a scared girl that doesn\'t want to get hurt omg can you help me"" card so the waiter helped me do this so I could take photos.The stones came in this hot pot. The waiter told me that the 102 meant not the temperature of the stones but that location of the first shop.0The stone is placed on my spoon.0Then the stone is placed gently into my soup. Bubbles erupted and a sizzling sound began. It felt like those cast iron steak places.0After the bubbling subsides, the spoon is placed on top to cover up the bubbles so you don\'t hurt yourself. When all the bubbles are finished bubbling, you stir your soup and around and presto! Hot soup again! If you want, you can leave your rock in there or take it out.0Fun little photo moment.0I added hot dashi soup after I was finished my noodles to dilute it to drink up the rest of my soup. The soup was very rich even after I diluted it. But not salty after dilution.Excellent ramen with a nice gimmick stone that does reheat the soup for a bit. You can request a paper bib if you don\'t want to dirty your clothes while eating. And for their first week of opening, they are offering free VIP membership to the first 102 customers. It wasn\'t busy when I went on opening day and it was 3 PM. I was only number 92. So, now I am a VIP member. I asked what that meant and they said sometimes they will have special ramen for VIPs to choose from and other fun things. AWESOME! Will return again and will try something called a water gyzoa. I was by myself so one bowl of noodles was enough for me. Perhaps next time I come with boyfriend, we\'ll order that. I had a coworker who went the next day and said they were steamed and not pan fried and excellent. Curious I will return for that.'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-%E3%81%A4%E3%81%91%E3%82%81%E3%82%93tetsu/471359?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

The environment is nice and full of bamboo surrounding the dinning area. The sashimi is fresh with high quality. The sushi rice is mixed with the sauce and sushi vinegar. Its a perfect match with the tuna. The taste of uni is kinda sweet without the bitter flavour. I would definitely come back for more dishes in future.000', ""Been to Ta-ke after it moved to Lee Garden II. This was the first time we sat in front of the tempura counter, witnessing the chef bringing us the mouth-watering crispy dishes one at a time.We were told that the Omakase Tempura set, has been available for long, only served to tempura counter guests, 6 seats encircling the tempura counter is maximum, so advance booking definitely is a must.Since one of my friend doesn't like sitting on high chair, so that led us to main dining area in the past visits, no wonder we didn't realized such a value for price omakase tempura set(dinner set also available) until now.This time, while my friend was enjoying each dishes according to the menu (we were told that certain items change with seasons accordingly),as a plant-base eater, I was literally expecting a surprise meal, so I really appreciated Chef Hara and team for specially arranging all those creative, good looking yet yummy vegetarian dishes for me. Therefore, the whole dining experience was thoroughly enjoyable.

Besides its much more convenient location (yes with parking!), Ta-ke have expanded its menu into the realms of Teppanyaki, Tempura and Kaiseki, offering much more choices for pretty much anyone to enjoy.The interior of Ta-ke is much like a journey down a traditional Japanese zen garden  dark and simple wooden walls at the entrance, white pebbles and rocks leading the way into the dining area, layers and layers of bamboo overcrossing the entire space this could go on and on but before I get too deep about the interior I should probably stop, because were here to talk about the food.Apart from my usual favorite sushi omakase I have decided to give it a try on its new teppanyaki lunch menu. To me with the amount of dishes included as well as the quality of the ingredients they offer, $480 is a bargain especially given the interior and location of the restaurant. We started off with Nagasaki Oyster accompanied with vinaigrette. Being currently the season of oysters it is no doubt it is both large in size and extremely fresh in taste.Nagasaki Oyster0Nagasaki OysterThe yellowtail carpaccio comes next and to my opinion this is as expected. Nothing surprising and nothing unpleasant.Yellowtail Carpaccio0Yellowtail CarpaccioAfter that we move on to our fish course  Red Tilefish with Sea Urchin in Fish Soup. By far this is my favorite dish of the afternoon. Served elegantly in a black ceramic plate, it tastes as good as it meets the eyes. Scales of the fish are fried carefully to create a crispy layer that complements perfectly with the silky smooth fillet. A homemade sea urchin and fish soup sauce adds that extra flavor and spice to the general taste of the dish. What surprises me the most though is the deep-fried risotto hidden underneath the fillet. Flavored with black truffle and crispy in texture, this is what I called a hidden gem.Red Tilefish with Sea Urchin in Fish Soup0Red Tilefish with Sea Urchin in Fish SoupThe meat course uses A4 wagyu from Miyazaki and the first thing I noticed is its generous portion. You can expect around 6 dices and for those who are familiar with wagyu, even a small portion of this precious meat will be enough to fill your stomach because of its rich and aromatic taste. Soft in texture and not overwhelmingly greasy, this wagyu is exactly what I prefer personally as sometimes I get too filled-up with the super melt-in-your-mouth A5 grade wagyu. However it all comes down to personal preferences. Accompanied on the sides are mushrooms, deep-fried garlic flakes and a meat sauce.A4 Miyazaki Wagyu0A4 Miyazaki WagyuAs if they are afraid you will leave the restaurant half-full, another generous portion of garlic fried rice, assorted vegetables, miso soup and pickles come next. The rice is fried with small pieces of the same A4 wagyu we tried before, giving more taste and flavor.Teppanyaki Assorted Vegetables0Teppanyaki Assorted VegetablesTo complete the entire set we are served with a small chocolate cake with cherry on the sides. I was probably too full at that moment to take any pictures, sorry!The taste, service and interior of Ta-ke did not disappoint. Even with its high average check I think it is still value-for-money. I would expect the restaurant to continue to impress and it wouldnt surprise me if they obtain any Michelin recognition next year.'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-ta-ke/566120?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
700,Tai Hing,Causeway Bay,Chinese,2.5,61.0,0.0,"This Tai Hing is the new location in Causeway Bay, opened several months already, this place is bigger than the one around the corner where they used to have the place.  0My usual order is the curry beef brisket with rice.  This dish never disappoint, they are never spicy but the sauce is thick and creamy.  Always love the potato fries that they include in the curry, a very nice touch to the dish.  Their curry beef is so popular that the shop makes their own ready to eat canned version for people to buy and eat at home.  0The other famous product that they have is the ice chilled milk tea.  Cold milk tea with ice on the outside.  This is a way for the milk tea to keep cool without losing the taste or be watered down when the ice melts inside the drink.', 'One of the more known styles of Cantonese cuisine is the Chinese Deli. Half butcher shop and half restaurant, the deli prepares, cooks, and serves popular meat dish of duck, chicken, pork, and sausage. You cant miss them, with the roast pork and steamed chicken hanging in the windows. When I am in Hong Kong, these little shops/restaurants/hole-in-the-walls are my favorite and secret grubbing holes. I love these simple lunch plates, As Mr. L put it  Its just meat on rice.Tai Hing is a restaurant chain that specializes in the deli style. They cleaned up the small dingy and dirty communal tables in favor for bright colors and booth seating. I kinda liked the stand-in-line, then sit-with-strangers, and eat-hunched-down feeling. Tai Hing apparently has McDonaldized the traditional Cantonese Deli. Its great for tourists, families, and I guess a younger generation.Tai Hing boasts a roast pork that is so good that they gave it 5 stars. As you walk in, you notice the two large pieces of roast pork hanging in the window with its golden brown crusted skin hiding behind the tender white pork meat. I knew, immediately, that i had to order that. Along with the 5-Star Roast Pork, we also added BBQ pork on my rice plate. The 5-Star Roast Pork was anything but 5-Star. The skin was a little more chewy than it had to be. The presentation of the roast pork had little skin. The meat was dry, so thank god we had the hoisin dipping sauce. With the BBQ pork, I must also say I was throughly unimpressed. The BBQ pork lacked the proper fat to meat ratio (which is 1:1), with barely any fat. Perhaps it is the new generation and foreign tourist aversion to fat, which led them to no include it. I know all Hong Kongers should know the requisite fat to meat ratio on BBQ pork.We also shared a texas toast with butter and peanut butter spread. At least this was more than acceptable. But I doubt, I return to Tai Hing just for the toast. Usually found in Hong Kong cafes, I think Tai Hing is trying to appeal to a younger hip crowd with these sweets. The iced milk tea was also pretty good. I liked how they served it cold with a bowl of ice. I thought that was unique.As much as I wanted to like Tai Hing, with the 5-Star Roast Pork, I had a let down. I know Miss Y and Mr. P liked the toast.Check out some pictures I took at http://wp.me/p12aCk-15R'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-tai-hing/553448?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

But I really fell in love with the Sweet and Sour Pork. It was really damn crispy and good. Yummy! We had some leftovers and it was still crispy at the end of day.

702,Tai Woo Seafood Restaurant,Causeway Bay,Chinese,3.2,120.0,0.0,"Tai Woo is a restaurant that my father seems to like quite a bit. It's one of those Chinese restaurants that serve classic Cantonese dishes along with seafood at night and dim sum during the day (and they even serve late nght dim sum until 3 AM!). To my father, this is the restaurant he grew up on and could always count on being excellent value for money.The original shop used to be down the street but as rent increased, it moved to this current location. I haven't visited this new location. It seemed a bit smaller than the old one but the same decor was present. A very old style Chinese restaurant. None of the newer chic minimalist styles we see now. Tai Woo has several dishes they have won awards for and they proudly display them all over the restaurant including the boxes of tissues on each table. I've tried some of the award winning dishes with my father and yeah...they are pretty good.So, on this day, boyfriend and I came here for dim sum. As it was a weekday, we were surrounded by senior cititizens. Yup ... these are people from my father's generation who still think this place is the best.Menu is in Chinese with a selected menu in English.Shrimp Toast. A bit too oily but packed with shrimp that was pretty good. It had a nice crunchy texture.0Steamed Char Siu and Mushroom Rice Rolls. Skin was not too thick and not too thin. The char siu was ok. The rolls had little bits of shimeji mushrooms instead of Chinese shitake which made it not as strong in mushroom taste.0Steamed Beef Siu Mai. This is a rather old school dim sum that many places don't do anymore. It tasted like the steamed beef balls except with a wonton wrapper around it. Tasted ok and I liked the addition of corn niblets for extra sweetness.0Taro Root, Eggplant wrapped Fish Roll. This is another very old school dim sum dish that not many do anymore. It's basically minched dace fish meat sandwiched between a slice of taro root and a slice of eggplant. It's then pan fried then steamed and layered with sauce. The taro root was still a bit chalky and could have cooked a bit longer. But the eggplant and fish meat were pretty good. An interesting combination.0Braised Chicken Feet. A staple in dim sum classics. I think they had two batches in this dish as some of the chicken feet were not flavored at all while the some of the other ones were too salty. And then some were just perfect. Quite inconsistent.0Deep Fried Spinach Wontons with Lobster Soup. The lobster soup was used as the dip for the wontons. A bit different than other places who would normall provide some sort of sweet and sour dipping sauce. Instead, we were given this lobster soup. The soup really didn't taste like lobster at all. Tasted more like Chinese tomato and potato soup. The wontons were pretty good and not oily at all. It was packed with spinach and pork. Dipping it into the soup just made them soggy so I stopped doing that for the rest of the wontons.0Pan Fried Dace Fish Cakes. These were basically dace fish meat, panfried and covered in sesame seeds. I liked it as the fish meat was good and had a nice bouncy texture.0The restaurant had some dishes that waitresses walk around on trays and report that it's fresh from the kitchen and see if anyone is interested. These items were not listed on the dim sum menu and apparently hot items. Boyfriend was contemplating on getting one but then all 5 dishes were gone in less than 3 minutes from elderly people rusing to get a dish that we ended up being too slow.Rather inexpensive dim sum. We paid a total of $180. Not bad at all. Dim sum is very old style and that is sometimes the best kind of dim sum. When you go back to basics and what you grew up on. Things that are familiar. Will be back."", ""Tai Woo0Tai WooI came here on a Saturday at 1:10pm with two friends.  Having previously had dinner here, I remembered that the food and service was good.

The general quality of the dim sum was only OK   I was most disappointed about the shrimp dumplings, as they are my favorite dim sum dish.  The dumplings were too hard and lacked the nice soft outer layer.  The fried turnip cake was good, but it came without any sauce.  We had to ask four different waiters/waitresses for sauce.  The presentation of the xiu lung bao was nice, but it lacked juiciness.  The plum spare rib wasn't a good mix, probably because we were expecting something a bit more salty instead of sweet.  The spring rolls, beef cheung fan and beef balls were good...... As for the fried baby pigeons, well... they never came!   We joked that they must have flown away... Overall, we were disappointed and won't come back for dim sum.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-tai-woo-seafood-restaurant/3489?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

704,Tainan A Dou Zai,Causeway Bay,Chinese,2.3,75.0,0.0,"Tainan Mr. Bean is a new restaurant in Causeway Bay. Located in an area of Causeway Bay that they are trying to make more hip and cool (right behind Lee Garden), the design tries to mimic a typical Taiwanese nightmarket. Being new and with lunch sets not over $100, it is fairly popular with a lengthy queue. Boyfriend and I decided to try them for lunch and arrived early. Just when they opened to skip the queue.0Lunch menu is in the form of circling what you want on a piece of paper. It's in Chinese only. There is no English h and no 10% service charge. You pay cash only. Price is $65 and $75 (depending on the main). What you get is an appetizer (the column in the middle) and a main (which is a rice or noodle) and a set drink. We both decided to get the $75 sets.1Set Drinks. Set drinks were served in a mason jar. We didn't order anything special. Just an ice coffee and ice tea as we couldn't find the list for special drinks. This is the exact amount of drink that arrived. Why serve a drink in a mason jar without filling it to the top? It made it seem like they were skimpy on the quantity. Which is most likely the case.0Sweet Potato Fries. This was boyfriend's choice of appetizer. The fries were soft and super sweet from the sweet potato. They were cripsy but more on the soft side. They further doused in it sugar so it made it even more sweet. This coating of sugar was really not necessary.1Soysauce Marinaded Selection of Offals. This was my appetizer. A small plate of intestines, pig ear and kidney. The marinade wasn't rich and there was this strange gloop of thick sweet sauce on the side. The kidney wasn't properly prepared as it still tasted a bit gamey that is often found when it's not cleaned properly.0Minced Meat with Rice. This was the rice dish boyfriend chose. Size was not big. It came in a small bowl. The sauce was sweet and tasted a bit like the sauce that was found in my plate of offals. The meat was a bit too oily for my liking. It seemed like it was mostly fat.1Seafood and Mince Meat Noodle. This is what I chose for a noodle dish. The soup was ok. The shrimp was firm and fresh. There was the same mince meat topping as the rice so it was mostly fat more than meat. The marinaded egg was a bit on the bland side. But what was disappointing was the noodles. It still had the starchy after taste that is found in noodles that have not been rinsed properly.0Disappointing all around. Restaurant is designed well with service ok. Prices not expensive. But tood isn't veryg good.. It seems like they focused more on the design and making everything look pretty but forgot all about the taste. There are far better Taiwanese restaurants in Hong Kong, so there is no need for me to return again.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-tainan-a-dou-zai/502907?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

The service was good and the staff members were all very kind and well-mannered. They do not have many choices but I like that we were able to choose the texture of the noodle (hard, medium or soft) and how thick we want the soup base to be. So, it is suitable for anyone. I would definitely recommend it to other people and would go there again next time.

716,TeaWood Taiwanese Cafe & Restaurant,Central,Chinese,3.6,250.0,0.0,"Teawood is one of those places that seem like a solid choice when it comes to not being sure what to eat or if I'm with girlfriends who don't want to choose anything they aren't familiar with. As that is what Teawood does well. It offers a nice consistent area for customers, serving various Taiwanese favorites for a reasonable price in a pretty setting.Boyfriend and I were in Central for Art Central and found that they had opened a new Teawood in Central. We had never noticed this branch before, so we gave it a try. It seemed that the design was different than the other branches. Usually they have a very white and beige design, a very Muji type feel. But this one was more luxurious as they opted for dark wood panels and leather seats. I assume they are focusing more on a different type of customer in Central as opposed to their other branches?Menu is in English and Chinese and is like their usual trademark newspaper type format. However, I noticed that they have reservation service here at night. I guess that's pretty good because the queues at Teawood can get pretty insane.0Cuttlefish Roll in Soy Sauce, Sesame Oil and Wine ($72).We shared a starter of marinated cuttlefish. This was placed over a small candle to keep it warm. I liked it. The cuttlefish was tender and not over cooked. The sauce was not too salty and had a lot of big pieces of sliced ginger that made the whole dish smell fantastic.0Fried Chicken Fillet and Marinated Minced Pork with Rice ($80).Boyfriend had this. It seems a lot of the time we eat at Teawood, he orders this. The chicken fillet crispy but still moist and not dry on the inside. It seemed they marinated the skin with a salt and pepper mixture that is popular in a lot of Taiwanese fried food items. The minced pork was sweet and went well with finishing off the rice. It came with a bit of pickled vegetables and half a soysauce marinaded egg.0Handmade Pasta with Cheese and Creamy Boston Lobster ($138).I noticed they served pasta here, something I never noticed in other branches. When it arrived, I was surprised the lobster was bigger than the amount of pasta. It tasted ok. The pasta was cooked al dente. But what I liked was the sauce. It had a strong cheese taste. It was so creamy and rich. A pretty decent cheese sauce that I think would have been better with macaroni for a mac n cheese.0Brown Sugar Bed Bean in Ice Pearl Milk Tea ($38).Boyfriend ordered this as his drink. Drink was fairly sweet from the brown sugar but the tea used was fragrant and rich. The tapioca pearls were soft.0Rose and Roselle Tea ($40).I chose this drink and it came in a pot that you can refill upon request. It smelled lovely but the roselle over powered everything when you tasted it. I think it needed a touch of honey to sweeten it up as I love honey with my tea. But that is not available.0Tiramisu Danish Toast ($90).I remember the first time I had one of these from Teawood. I had ordered it with such joy but then as I continued to eat, I regretted my choice and I left it in a soggy ice cream mess. I guess boyfriend forgot about my dread of eating this as he ordered it without my knowledge. When it arrived, I was all set for the painful regret that will sink in. But for some reason, this didn't happen. Why? Teawood improved on their signature toast. Improved on it significantly. The bread used was toasted so it was still crispy. The bread used was also better as it was buttery Danish bread. Everything tastes better with butter. They also used a better ice cream (that was coffee flavored) as it was smooth and creamy. I recall before the ice cream didn't taste like ice cream but this strange fluffy cream. It is now just one scoop of ice cream so it didn't melt to become one big puddle, making everything soggy. The ice cream to toast proportions is now more balanced. I'm glad they made such a good improvement on this so now when my girlfriends insist on ordering, I can now nod my head instead of begging no.0Teawood is always a solid place that I go to often. A good option for me to choose for my next girlfriend gathering.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-teawood-taiwanese-cafe-restaurant/486576?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

A building in Causeway Bay with a lot of excellent Japanese restaurants. In fact, this building is where a lot of Japanese expats eat so I'm always assured a pretty decent meal.Tensho had been opened for a year now and I have yet to try it. Not my fault really as there are just far too many restaurants in Causeway Bay. But Tensho was always under my radar and I gave it a try that afternoon. The restaurant wasn't very big but it was spacious enough. There are tables but I opted to sit at the bar table as I love the watch the chef at work. Upon sitting down, I noticed my surrounding customers. They were all Japanese. Another thing was the chef. He looked familiar. I had seen him some where and it didn't ring a bell until I went home later that night. He was the esteemed Chef Ito Katsuhiro. Working previously at Hotel Nikko before opening Tensho in Wanchai until it closed due to building redevelopment. He later reopened under Youka, also located in Wanchai. But that closed. But he has reappeared again! And so has the return of Tensho!0I was presented with the lunch menu. Menu is in English, Chinese and Japanese. Most sets were under $200. Sets include an appetizer, salad, chawanmushi, miso soup and dessert. I decided to opt for the bento box set ($280) so I could try a little bit of everything. Plus, I just love everything in little pieces.0The salad was a simple with crisp salad greens and sesame dressing. Nothing very special about it. Portion size was a bit bigger than expected.0There was an appetizer of spinach greens topped with bonito flakes. This was very light with a small amount of seasoning. Basically, let the vegetable speak for itself.0Chawanamushi was smooth and silky. Appreciated that they didn't put a layer of broth on top that is so popular in some places now a days. Just let the ingredients speak for themselves.0There was also a plate of pickles. Quite honestly, I've been to a lot of Japanese restaurants and this place probably provides the most amount of pickles. They were pretty good, too and helped finish off my rice.0The miso soup was fine. Nothing that really wowed me.0The bento included four different cooked dishes.0There was a deep fried tofu, topped with bonito flakes that is also hit with a slightly spicy paste. The tofu was soft and smooth. The sauce that accompanied it was not too strong.0A braised pork belly with shimeji mushrooms. The pork belly was soft and literally fell apart when I picked at it with y chopsticks.0There was a selection of tempura items that included shrimp, okra, sweet potato, pumpkin and eggplant. The crispy tempura was light and not oily at all.0This last small plate included a piece of grilled makerral, tamagoyaki and salmon roe on top of grated daikon. Again portions here are pretty generous. The tamagoyaki was a nice big portion. And oh so soft and sweet. The fish was grilled perfectly. Lightly seasoned as well. The salmon roe was a good way to finish off my rice. Salty and cooled down by the daikon underneath.0There was also two pieces of sushi. A utterly melt in your mouth toro and a delicately delicious snapper. The quality of the fish was excellent and I can now understand why all the Japanese customers were eating sushi rice.0The meal ended with dessert. Two slices of crisp apple. Simple and to the point.0That is the thing with my lunch. It was simple and to the point. The chef let the ingredients speak for themselves and that is something I can appreciate. I love how quiet it is as I hate lunch places were it's so noisy, I can't hear myself think. The chef was attentive to all his customers. Even at one point, he noticed I had problems picking up the soft tofu and he gestured to a wait staff to provide me with a spoon. He doesn't say much but one could tell, he really cared for all he served. It's no wonder all his customers seemed to be regulars. And I? I'll be back. I'll try a sushi rice next time. !"", 'In recent years , restaurants with authentic Japanese chefs are harder to come by.

They do not offer nigiri sushi but nevertheless they do offer sashimiitemson the menu.Traditionally in Japan chirashi (Sashimi rice bowl) is a dish where chef serves the less popular fish as a way todispose them. But here, the chirashi is probably the best value in Causeway Bay. For just HK$180 it includes ingredients that you seldom find in other shops ( chu-toro, ama-ebi, ikura, kani, uni and akami etc). All the ingredients very high in quality and freshness. The set also comes with a salad , steamed egg, miso soup and ice cream.

They asked if we were sharing and we replied the two having standard set will share with each other and the two having exec lunch with share with each other. So first off, the teppanyaki chef did not smile one bit the entire time, did not address us...the only time he spoke to us was to tell us everything we ordered has arrived.Secondly, the wait staff is quite inexperience. After the teppanyaki chef cooks the food, the wait staff would serve the food. The waiter would come and stand near the chef and pass out four plates of food often times reaching over me or brushing my shoulder, is this a 'cha chan tang'?  Com'on. Third, the quality of food is not even good. The tenderloin was not tender, shrimps are frozen, everything is served drenched in sauces to mask the 'non-freshness', I assume.

What\'s the point of prata without curry? I asked the waiter if the chef can make the curry less spicy, and never have I ever heard a waiter say ""no sorry, the curry is already made so it cannot be adjusted."" To make curry less spicy, you can add more coconut milk?? You can\'t even ask the chef to add more coconut milk? Fine, I ended up ordering pad thai.When the pad thai came, it was all clumped together and half cold. That\'s fine for me, I still ate it but it was basically not worth the price.

There were many set lunches to choose from. 2 were at only $46 but neither seemed particularly authentic Thai. The next lot were between $55-$70+ and were mainly fried rice and noodles with some Thai dishes. The best ones were their executive lunches. Although all lunch sets came with self service salad, starter and dessert bar and coffee, the executive sets had authentic Thai dishes like Yellow curry king prawns, fish on a stove in sour and hot soup, 1/2 whole boneless Hainanese chicken etc which offered the best value. We chose 3 executive sets, Fried lamb with mango - not very good and not much of any taste Yellow curry king prawns- 2 whole king prawns cut into halves, full of rich flavour and not too chilli Boneless Hainanese Chicken- meat quite tender but not the best example of the dish The manager was very helpful and he told us if we order the fish in sour soup on the stove, it would be a full whole fish and the same as the dinner portion size at only $88 with all the things that the lunch comes with. We figured the executive lunches were really good value then. Iced coffee and tea were not charged extra. Dessert from the bar was a cocunut soupy mix with some giant sago and yam.The place was a bit noisy, so we decided to go to Chilli Club for our company dinner next week instead.'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/wan-chai-thai-delight/17339?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw
725,Thai Dynasty Restaurant,Wan Chai,Thai,2.8,55.0,,"Wan Chai is a lunch hotspot. Let\'s not forget that the crowd from CWB who has gotten tired of lineups and repeated chains, or the Admiralty crowd who has reservations over hyped-up joints when they wanted something simpler (and dishes they can pronounce, or are familiar with...) That makes the district extra packed. I was lucky enough to get a table at the new Thai Dynasty in the first week of opening. Luckily enough not many people have discovered the joint, despite students by the hundreds walk past it during lunch hours. The decor was simple -- the typical Thai Buddha statue up front, with wooden furnishing and dim lights, which make my amateur photographing technique even worse in these pictures.Decor aside, lunches are appropriately priced for lunch crowds. The kitchen expects you to order set lunches and leave the a la carte menu for dinner. The lunch menu is extensive and offers wide range of food from noodles in Tom Yum Soup to Chicken in Green Curry. I meanly ordered the Rice with Hainanese Chicken and Grilled Pork, the other party opted for the ""Thai Steamed Seafood with Curry"", also served with rice. The lunches arrived promptly, with the rice dome settling at the center, it\'d be no surprise that the kitchen has it all scooped and molded long before we even sat down. The division of labour ended at the curries. The curry was topped with more may look like scrambled eggs. On first tasting, the yellow \'mass\' indeed tasted like egg, and on the second spoonful I can confirm -- It really is EGG!!! But immediately I took a step back and thought, why was it there in the first place? Ignoring the appropriateness of the egg, the curry was mildly spicy with strong presence of lemongrass and coconut. The sauce was thicker than I anticipated. The prawns and squid were cooked well. Overall the curry was alright, if you don\'t count the misplaced egg, which pretty much was everywhere. (The runny egg could blend into the sauce, which makes it better!)The Rice with Hainanese Chicken and Grilled Pork was a satisfactory attempt on the chicken part. The grilled pork was obviously overcooked and too tough to be called ""fatty pork"", as it claimed to be. The chicken, however, was moist and tender. It has a good flavour, with or without its lemongrass dipping sauce that went perfectly with rice. We also ordered Thai Limeade and Iced Longan Tea with our lunches. The Thai Limeade was simple -- slices of lime with iced water, lightened up with syrup. The drink turned out tangy without the cloying sweetness many may fear. The light addition of salt makes it all the better. The Iced Longan Tea was exactly what the name suggested. It has this caramel taste to it and did not taste half as bad as it sounded.I have yet to try dinner one night to tell how good Thai Dynasty is. The menu looked ok with Tom Yum Soup and Green Papaya Salad and all the usual suspects. Lunch-wise it\'s quite of good value. The food came out piping hot and you can ask for suggestions if you\'re not sure what to order. The waitstaff are very casual and informative with the menu.Thai Steamed Seafood Curry with Rice0Thai Steamed Seafood Curry with RiceRice with Hainanese Chicken and Grilled Pork0Rice with Hainanese Chicken and Grilled PorkThai Limeade0Thai LimeadeIced Longan Tea0Iced Longan Tea'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/wan-chai-thai-dynasty-restaurant/30986?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
726,Thai Farmer Restaurant,Wan Chai,Thai,3.6,145.0,0.0,"2Heading to Wanchai quite often these days because of my new apartment issue, well, it gives me chances to explore 'where-to-go' for eaters. To mention Lockhart Road, what your reaction in brain firstly? I guess some of you will say bars and some say indoor-decoration, and some say... (you know); while I say Thai food. It is not a famous block for Thai cuisine as in Kowloon City, but it matters something in Hong Kong Island.Lockhart Road, close to bar street side, I have already written up one blog about the street restaurant weeks before, and now I find another little restaurant there which is featured with North-east Thai food, and most importantly, impresses me a lot by the friendly and tender service.Coconut Juice $382Coconut Juice $38My lovely best girl friend & trouble-maker girl & new roommate, has such a big influence on me, too many changes before, and now in the way of fresh coconut juice. After days' coconut juicy experience during her backpacker trip in Southeast Asia, her judgement on the coconut juicy makes sense to not only me, but also to the readers I believe. She said, the coconut this restaurant offered, was not the best compared to Thailand ones, but was in good quality. Papaya Salad $582Papaya Salad $58I love any salad in Thai style, because those dishes mean fresh, juicy, hot spicy, crispy, tongue-inspiring... I'm obsessed to the Thai chili sauce in such a rich taste of sweet, sour and spicy, and I cannot stop till the dish is finished. And the Papaya Salad from this restaurant doesn't disappoint me.Green Curry (Chicken) $681Green Curry (Chicken) $68Green Curry with chicken (can also choose from beef/pork) and vegetables, I'm quite satisfied to the purely green color which I seldom find during my recent experience of Thai restaurant. Everything in the curry remains its own feature, like pepper (juicy and fresh), lime (soft and tender), chicken (soft and flavorful). The most importantly, I like the green curry, that is not too coconut-milk focused, not too spicy, but 'curry-enough' Morning Glory $582Morning Glory $58Beans, garlic, and morning glory. You will never let it go when it is on your table. Completed pan fried vegetable has a super moisture and soft texture, and it absorbs the tasty soup completely. The only thing I would worry about is, how to stop eating :0In general, I like this little Thai restaurant. Everything there is normal, normal menu, normal presentation, normal price (this is good); but something is not that normal. I like the cute lady that afternoon, very nice and friendly, very quiet and thoughtful.

727,Thai Flavour,Wan Chai,Thai,1.9,50.5,10.0,"I was walking pass wan chai and just wanna have thai food, so I ordered a prawn pad Thai !!!It cost me $61 dollars including the take away box! It smelled very peanuts when I bring back office. After I ate a bit, I discovered there are some dirty dark spots in my noodles! I was like.... oh my gosh, they didn't clean the frying pan at all before cooking my noodles.I understand that it's busy lunch hour but I don't mind waiting for extra 5 mins !!!I don't think I will go again given there are lots of options nearby!!!!100"", 'I\'m not going to play on words this time, knowing that I have already done that and it was darn funny. This time I\'ll focus on the experience.  Chun Yuen Street at 1 pm is hectic, almost war-zone like, in a way that the mixed crusaders who lunch march their ways into any restaurant they can find. They run in groups, weapons in hand (women: large purses/ men: purses, too -- these days, let\'s cut them some slack!), staking their claims joining the long lines of loud-calling numbers. Those who failed to sit down right away or at least in 5 minutes fret in despair, as if losing the battle. Some determined and optimistic enough they could ""still beat it"" (the time, that is).  Lunching here, afterall, is mostly fast food -- factory-lined processes that didn\'t really need extra time to prepare. It\'s all done before the 12 pm crowd arrives. All it takes for the kithen to do is to scoop and serve. This day, the Thai place has the shortest line, and without further ado, I jumped into the queue, clearly I was right, within 5 minutes, I was seated.  It was the narrowest seat I\'ve ever been seated, and the most uncomfortable too. But that didn\'t matter, it\'s fast food, remember? The shop was quite dark even on a sunny day, as if the owners have decided to skim on lighting for a good cause. We ordered one order of the Hainanese Chicken, and another, a bowl of thin rice noodles with Thai fish cakes and Porkchop with lemongrass and a soup base of coconut chicken soup.  It didn\'t surprise me that they arrived in a flash. Our attention landed on the noodles first. The porkchop was cut into strips, and the fish cakes (2 whole pieces, each cut in half) were piled up on the top, beneath it the ""white on white"" combination of coconut chicken soup base, soaking into starch-white rice noodles and a bunch of bean sprouts for crunch. The broth was not as thick as an ordinary coconut chicken soup you normally would have. It\'s lighter, and had the combination of flavours in it -- the slight richness of coconut milk after greeted by the astringent zesty lime juice. Chopped bits of lemongrass stalks were floating about in the broth, and contributed the flavours as well. Refreshing enough, the porkchop was also of lemongrass flavour -- strips of fried porkchop warmed up in advance. It wasn\'t quite as easy to chew, but seasoning was done thoroughly. The fish cake, thick and fried in advance, was textbook -- with fine juliennes of kaffir lime leaves and coriander leaves. It tasted like the fish cakes I\'ve always had. I would, however, prefer it freshly fried. The noodles were not turned into mush, and that, I think was more than I can hope for given how little time we waited for it.The Hainanese chicken was supposedly boneless, which was a disappointment to begin with. I always considered making it boneless a redundant attempt to be lazy. (Maybe I just like gnawing on the bony bits too much). They come in boneless strips, skin on (comforting!) neatly in a pile. The skin was golden and pieces of meat moist and tender, not exactly full-blown flavour though. (It\'s not overcooked, which offered me some relief). The rice was a fluffy dome well flavored with juices from chicken and the broth the chicken was cooked in. They complimented each other, and on a personal side of things, I tend to like the rice a little bit more because they have taken in more flavorful juices. But well, that\'s just me. The accompanied soup never arrived at our table, but the lime soda wasn\'t half bad. The slight sprinkle of salt muddled with the wedge of lime was just right, combined with sugar and soda water to make a refreshing drink that quench the thirst in the mid-summery day. We hurried through the two orders, and within half an hour, we were out the door as another two lunch-hopefuls hurried in for their turns. It is hard to say where the line-ups go, as they change day by day. Sometimes this place have a line so long it extends towards the store next door, sometimes, like this time, took less than 5 minutes to get in. The food you can count on the simpler orders. Anything more complicated than fried noodles you can skip if it\'s for lunch. Think about it, the popular items are often prepared with care in advance, they probably wouldn\'t spend much time entertaining special requests or those that are too ""different"". It\'s not just about playing safe on the restaurant\'s side, you\'d prefer the better prepared dishes, don\'t you?

For extra 12 HKD we got some steamed vegetables. The food was a very big portion and tasted very good. The thai green curry was a little spicy and had different vegetables and lots of chicken. The pork neck tasted very nice however since there was no sauce with the rice the rice tasted a bit dry and bland. The free soup was very yummy and made with wintermelon. Other lunch sets are with noodle soups and even cheaper.Overall:  The price, the amount of food, the taste and the fact that this is in central make this restaurant my new favourite choice! Very good taste, big portion size... the only thing that could need some improvement is the waiting time of around 15 minutes in the heat in the small (but busy) sidestreet.

My friends chose to eat here before I knew it, so I ended up eating here again in this seemingly Western but Chinese styled restaurant.Why would I say its a Chinese-Version-Western restaurant?You would know the answer right away if you check their lunch menu out.  For the dishes, although they were western dishes but most of them sounded Chinese, which included pork chop spaghetti, beef with rice, spaghetti, spring chicken rice etc. For soup options, there were Mushroom soup or Vegetable soup. Which to me, is EXTREMELY Chinese-version-Western restaurant like the Boston in Wanchai. Yet the restaurants have a large notice board writting all the salads, panini, bagels etc that they offered all day long. So to concluded, it is literally a custard bun - Western on the outside, Asian on the inside. Although being deceived (due to my colleagues) once again into the shop, I found there were actually several foreigners came into the shop. I guess their marketing strategy works. However, would it work the second time? I guess the fact that we could always find a seat during the busiest hour of the day clearly justify thatOkay, so the lunch set were all priced at $48 with soup included. Most of the set came with rice, so if you want to have pasta, you have to add an extra $5 for it. Bad food, chaotic service but adding a 10% charge, what a ripped off.1) Vegetable SoupFirst its the vegetable soup that came with the bread. Since I joined my colleages late, I ordered late. When my soup came, all of my colleagues had already finished their soup and figured I had got a different bread than theirs. Theirs was toast, and judging by the look of my bread, they felt jealous that I had got mine. Having my first bite of my bread, I could instantly tell you that I wished the reverse. The bread was hard as hell and it was bitter. You could say its extremely chewy but it definitely wasn't something that I want to go with my soup. The soup was just a normal one, nothing really special about it.2) Pork Chop with Cheese sauceThe set was originally go with RICE! How absurd! I changed it into pasta and they asked for a topped up which I didn't really care. When the dish first came, it came with rice. I asked for a re-made. The restaurants seemed to have some problems in order taking. 3 out of 4 people that dined that day has got their set wrongly prepared. What;s more, the dish was, to put it bluntly, disgusting. The pork chop was hard as stone and tasteless. What's worse, there were other kind of pasta got into my spaghetti. I guess I was deceived by the word cheese, as I could not taste any cheese flavour at all after I have polished the whole dish. (I was starved.)To conclude, Big Apple, Big Disappointment. I repeated once again, even if you could not get any seating in any restaurant, try not to visit the restaurant (or completely out of the choice to the extreme while I could be). If you are desperate for food, save a meal and go to Mc, Donalds or really do go to Pacific Coffee and grab a sandwich. I will wish you luck if you insist on visiting the restaurant.www.cinnamon4coffee.blogspot,comInteresting Bread possibly the hardest inDaWorld0Interesting Bread possibly the hardest inDaWorldThe pork chop won over the bread in hardness0The pork chop won over the bread in hardness"", ""The reason I visited The Big Apple was because I lost my patient in waiting for a seating in the Laksa Restaurant on the opposite side of the very same street. I did not want to visit the restaurant at first because its name 'Big Apple' and its green store front decor suggested healthy which I wasn't feeling healthy at that moment. Anyway there were five of us, which was very difficult to find a seating in Jaffe Road whereas The Big Apple was among the few restaurants that you could not see a queue outside the restaurant. So there wasn't many choice, let's try it out!Originally I thought The Big Apple was all about sandwiches, but later the waitress brought us a lunch menu and there were pastas and curry etc. $48 for a lunch set with a main dish and the soup of the day was pretty much in a nice price range you could usually find in Wan Chai. Talking about the management of the restaurant, it was a total mess. The waitress were not thoughtful at all. They threw us several tissues and sets of utensil without knowing how many people we had. Then later on when I asked for knives, she really did give me a knife, one single knife for the five of us. She should had known that I was trying to get each of my friend a knife. Having said that, the waitresses fortunately had good attitude and I appreciate that very much.1) The Veggie SoupThe veggie soup came promptly with a toast stick at the side. The soup looked absolutely fantastic, but tasted differently. The flavour was light and did not really give much taste. The soup texture was thin. There wasn't much veggie in the soup. And if there were, they were too soft, almost melted up and became an essence of the soup which gave no texture at all. Yet the toast stick was nice. It was toasted to give a slightly toasted edge, but overall was still hot, soft and spongy.2) The Mushroom SoupI had several sip of my friend's mushroom soup, and it tasted quite interesting. The soup gave a strong mushroom taste. The mushroom flavour seemed to taste fresh but somehow also tasted a bit fishy. The soup was not particularly thick, but it would taste nicer if they add more wiped cream in when cooking to make it thicker. The texture of the soup was enhanced by plenty of mushroom bits in the bowl.3) Grilled Pork with Brown RiceThe sauce topping was AMAZING! It had a strong flavour, pretty sweet but was a perfect pair with the grilled pork. The dish came with a generous portion of pork. The pork pieces were thick, but the texture were very tender and soft. What was great about the pork was that they also had some burned bits at the end, like BBQ Roasted Pork's burned ends. The brown rice were nicely cooked too. The texture was soft and moist where usually they were made dry and coarse. I love the dish despite the dry green beans, and just wished there were more sauce on top.Generally, I felt contented about the food quality the Big Apple offers. There were lots of pictures of their sandwiches and burgers on the menu and around the shop. Most of them looked appetizing, I will definitely try them out in the future.www.cinnamon4coffee.blogspot.comAverage Veggie Soup With Excellent Toast Stick0Average Veggie Soup With Excellent Toast StickInteresting Mushroom Soup with a fishy taste0Interesting Mushroom Soup with a fishy tasteBrillant Sauce Topping and Tender pork on Nice Rice...0Brillant Sauce Topping and Tender pork on Nice Rice...""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/wan-chai-the-big-apple/46183?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
732,The Boss,Central,Chinese,3.6,300.0,,"As the headline suggests I went for dim sum on a Sunday.The restaurant has a slightly odd basement location. The interior is modern, but not fancy, let's say it doesn't distract from the food. Is a realatiy small restaurant (by Chinese standards), probably a bit under 20 tables.We ordered to types of char siu based dim sum. The baked one had a thin shell and lots of stuffing, which was quite sweet - together with the sugar on the bun a bit too sweet for my taste. Not bad, but no match for Tim Ho Wan's signature. The steamedchar siu bao was solid HK quality.The ha gow (shrimp dumplings) where at the higher end of the HK quality range - relatively large and with perfect texture.The sui mai where the least good of the lot with the shrimp overlooked and the overall flavor too mild.Finally we got the boss' signature fried rice, which was truly one of the best fried rice I ever had (and I had a lot in my life) - very dark and savory with lots of shrimp and a bit of green vegetables.As desert I picked one of my usual favorites - mango, sago, pomelo. A relatively disappointing version - too creamy and very liquid.Overall a good experience, but I don't understand why this restaurant deserves I Michelin star compared to many other equally good restaurants. Will come back for dinner, maybe I understand it then.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-the-boss/135392?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw
733,The Butchers Club Burger,Central,American,3.3,126.7,3.0,"Great little burger joint on Wellington Street! Have to say, the buns are great! A little bit crispy and the perfect size for its beef patty! The patty itself is well cooked! Pink in the inside! Not much marination, but the pickles, bacon, tomato, and cheese are in great proportion! The potato wedges were tasty. Personally, i think it is a bit pricy for a burger of this size for $100 and $20 for around 10 pieces of potato wedges. However, overall experience was great!Hamburger1HamburgerOver all, I give it an 8 out of 10 in my burger ratings!', 'Well well well, this time, my caucasian coworkers have brought a new high to my burger experience. As someone with no knowledge of this place whatsoever (before I went), my coworker helped me choose by ordering a double happiness (youneed to scan the menu\'s QR code to seea ""secret"" menu)and the duck fat fries to share.I like the ambience of this place which is casual. The music on the backgroundwere all familiar songs. What a good casual Monday lunch place.It took awhile for the food to come, but man the look of the burger was amazing. The double happiness beef patties were thick (1 inch each) and the cheese was oozing out. The burger buns were different from the normal burgers, with lots of oil (I\'m assuming they are buttered).It was a mess to cut the burger but it was worth it. I can\'t believe I had trouble eating the half portion as I thought it\'s not that big compared to the ones in North America but wow, I was so full! No wonder my other 2 coworkers were actually sharing the normal burger + fries and can\'t finish it. The fries were also very crispy and yummy.All in all, very satisfyingburger fix that feels like I am back to America, but I don\'t think I will go back on my own because the burger is really hard to be finished by just me!Supplementary InformationScan the QR code on the menu for more options!', ""I have been hearing about this place a lot lately, especially the original one in wan chai.As i live in Soho, I was very exicted to go try it myself and as it is very close to my place.When I arrive there, I ask to be seated somewhere but the staff just told me go find a seat by myself, which i found kind of odd and rude, but it is ok I guess it is the policy there!After finding my table, I was ready to get my food but surprisingly they only have one burger on the menu and a secret menu that you have to find on the website and use the QR code..such a waiste of time, don't u think so? I mean why don't u put it directly on the menu instead of obliging people to go on their smartphone and waiste time?Anyway, I order the very classic burger they have, the service was a bit slow (17min to wait to be accurate) considering that they only have one kind of burger to do. Eventually, I received my burger, it was a bit small compare to their ad but i guess it is marketing! The burger and french freid were good, i wouldn't say it is memorable tho for the price.So to put in a nutshell, I wouldn't recommend this place I think there is definately better burger place in town for much better deal even tho it was ok/good. But to be honest, I expect a little more considering the price of the burger and all the feedback I had from the press. On top of that, I found the staff a bit rude behaving like they had found something that would revolutionize the world...guys u just doing burger so a little respect to your customers wouldn't be too much.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-the-butchers-club-burger/434418?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

Two thumbs up- with two beef patties! haha"", 'Saw a lot of commercials and promotion by Green Monday and Green Common, the so called ""beyond meat"" burger patty made of plant-based proteins and fibers, and they cooperate with Butchers Club to co-launch the ""Beyond Meat Vegetarian Burger"", so I decided to give it a try since it looks really appetizing on the photo.HOWEVER, when the real one was shown in front of me, it\'s soooo small and substantially different from what it looks like on the picture, it\'s the same size as normal McDonald\'s burger and the layers are so thin and thrifty, I\'m not sure whether they\'re all there! In terms of the overall quality, it\'s quite oily actually (so again, being vegetarian DOES NOT necessarily mean HEALTHY), although the ""meat"" patty tasted fine and with real meat flavor, but in terms of HK$100 for a single burger, it doesn\'t worth the price at all and I wouldn\'t be willing to pay even HK50 for it! It\'s a pure snatch of  and scam! To conclude, don\'t even bother to try, there\'re a lot of good veggie burgers on the street and won\'t cost HK$100 even with additional soup.

Though it does not sound attractive to me, i still decided to give it a try, because this is a really famous res in the neighborhood, and in Central area, there is no fun eating salad/sashimi everyday for a calorie-sensitive human being...I ordered the basic burger though a so-called ""secret menu"" was provided, but i chose not to order any from them and quickly decided to go with the basic one. Reasons are: a) most are pricey; b) i was not wearing glasses and could barely read the ingredients under dim light; c) i was not comfortable standing next to some fat Caucasians and just want to wrap some food as fast as possible (this is not a discrimination over fat dude, i just dont understand for guys in those shape, how dare they can still eat burger and fries..).After waiting for 7 min or so, I got my burger from a hot waitress. The bummer is that they simply gave me a box (something like McDs burger box, squared one), which was kind of annoying. By no means can i just hold such a box to walk back my office. I need to hold it in the appropriate gestures to avoid it got crashed... Constructive suggestion there -- at least provide a decent paper package.. even McD offered paper bags!Sitting in front of my desk, I opened the burger and it did not disappoint or surprise me, as I did not expect too much lol. The beef was kind of dry and I double confirmed that aged beef was not my cup of tea. Pickles and cheese are great and I think I can have more, when the thought occurred to me that I shall revisit Big Fernand after the meeting this afternoon. I ate the side of the bun that has butter on (so it was like one third). No famous duck oil fries or otherwise I may suffer from breakout tomorrow.Well, for light taste diner like me, I wont visit there again but I wont judge the quality of the beef either. It is just does not match my taste.The most basic burger$ 1000The most basic burger$ 100', ""Having read so many reviews of this burger shop and the beautiful pictures on their food, we looked forward to get some real good burgers in this shop.On the menu hanging on the wall, there is only one choice for burger.

Ittookaround 10 min.for the food to come afterwe ordered [a burger ($100),duck fatfries ($20) and drink ($20)].1It was a greatdisappointment to us. The burger looked good in the picture, but it was VERY SMALL in real. The whole burger was small and the pattywasnot thick at all!According to their description in the website, their patties are made of dry-aged black Angus beef. Hoever, we didn't feel any special about it. The meat did not have rich flavor...To me, it's just similar to Triple O or some normal burger joints.00The duck fat fries were even disastrous. They also looked well in the box. But when we picked them out, they were all soggy and soft and were TASTELESS. I didn't see anything good of using the duck fat except giving it an oily coating.Whenwe paid $100 for a burger,we expect something more in terms of quality.

That was what was going through my head as I was standing outside on the street in the heat while taking a bite out of my $100 burger that was tiny and salty. I\'ve been waiting for the summer heat to subside to try Butchers Club Burger because I have passed by before and have seen the limited seating in the shop, but I decided to bite the bullet one afternoon as the weather had cooled down a bit even though it was still warm. I think most people know about their ""not-so-secret"" menu by now which you can look up online in advance but I decided to get the regular burger since it was my first time there. I placed my order at the cashier, started the fun game of looking for a seat and waiting for my number to be called out. As mentioned, I ended up finding a spot right outside in the alley where people had to stand and eat. Burger + Duck Fat Fries + Coke ($140) - my order was brought out to me on a cute wooden cutting board after 10-15 minutes wait. The burger was really small especially for the price but I was willing to overlook that if it was really amazing - except it wasn\'t. Served with cheddar cheese, glazed bacon, tomatoes, pickles and onion spread, the burger definitely has potential as the beef patty was actually quite tender and juicy. It was just really salty for some reason as if someone went crazy with the salt while doing the seasoning. It was so bad that even downing my can of coke didn\'t help and I ended up not finishing my tiny burger. The duck fat fries were decent but ended up tasting salty as well (not sure if it had to do with the burger which probably screwed up my taste buds by then).

This is my second encounter with The Butchers Club chain, and the first being the sister store in Aberdeen. Now with that as the backdrop, I was in fact not very satisfied with this $100 burger, especially having to walk 15-min over under 32 degrees Celsius.Anyhow, we were lucky to find two indoor seats at 1215pm, and I went straight to the queue to make my order. Didn't know why the cashier girl took sooo long to take orders - there's basically only THE burger and THE fries on the food menu. I ordered a $20 canned coke light for my colleague and I opted for the healthier (and cheaper) option of fresh juice in the local shop just around the corner (oops!).Two original burgers, one order of duck fat fries and a canned pop costed to a total of *ching ching* $240. I would say this is an acceptable price, yet definitely not cheap, for dry-aged beef or so as they claimed on the website. They do have root beer and cherry coke on the menu FYI, at a cost of $30 each, canned.After 13min or so our food arrived. Burger itself was not big, but to be fair, the meat patty was pretty thick, at least so wide that I wasn't able to bite through the entire deck of burger at one go. And no, this isn't a place to show your proper etiquette - they don't have forks so gotta go with your hands!0The bun was grilled but was apparently served at room temperature by the time our order arrived. The beef was juicy, tender and cooked just right, but I felt that the overall burger was lacking flavor so I had to add some hot sauce onto it.Beef cooked just right0Beef cooked just right0The fattening sauce was generously applied on the bun though and the taste of melted butter was good (how could it not, right?).Generous fattening sauce0Generous fattening sauceThe potato wedges were a little too salty, perhaps that's their way of balancing the lack of flavor of the burger? But, at least the fries were not soggy!So what's the hype all about? Probably because it's an affordable burger joint in the proximity of Star Street with Caucasian chefs? Been there, done that.

Finally we get the order number of #24 for the food We order 2 burgers + 2 soft drinks. Our burgers arrive at 12:30pm. I am totally disappointed for the first bite. The bread is cold and the beef inside is just warm only. I couldn't believe such burger would cost me a hundred dollar. I can say the beef inside are good, well fried, but not too juicy.The sauce and the pickles are just so so only. I think it's just a normal burger not worth for such a long queue or charge for $100.

We ordered only one set of duck fat fries to share but since we waited so long for our burgers, they gave us another set on the house. And apologized again. The burgers were so good. Amazingly perfect in every way. And the Chuck? It was so big, it was obscene. Boyfriend's mouth wasn't big enough to bite it all in one bite.

735,The Chinese Library,Central,Chinese,3.9,390.0,0.0,"When you first enter this restaurant, it is clear thatit wants to be in the companyof Central\'s high end Chinese food competition (Mott 32, Duddells, China Tang, even the China Club.). Unfortunately, The Chinese Library falls short of its mark.The room looks very classy. As one would expect from an Aqua Group restaurant,it is a visual stunner. However, the food (I had the Deluxe Set Menu lunch), the service, and the valuefor moneyare just ""ok"".First, the service. While my experience was not as bad as it was for some of the other folks who have posted reviews, it wasn\'t great either. My biggest gripe is that the servicewas extremely uneven, ranging from obsequious to non-existent in the course of a 90 minute lunch. Upon arrival, there was a flurry of activity but as my lunch wore on, the service became less and less. The staff seemed very inexperienced and the service was, generally, hesitant. At one point, a diner at the table next to me spilled a glass of wine onto the floor. Immediately, 5 wait staff sprang to action to clean it up. No problem with that - but unfortunately, for the next 10 minutes, there were no wait people doing anything else but trying to clean up the spilled wine. Trying to get anyone\'s attention to ask for thebill was futile. The only bright spot in the service was Nina. I asked her if she was the head waitress, because she was the only one who moved with confidence, was just the right amount of attentive, knew what she was doing, etc. She told me she was the most junior person. In this case, Aqua Group - please give Nina a promotion - she needs to train the other staff in your restaurant.The foodwas fine. A bit bland overall - nothing to get excited about. For the set lunch, the only standouts werethe groupa and the tofu panne cotta. Everything else was underseasoned or unwhelming. Like the service, the food was not horrible, but it wasn\'t excellent either. The portion size was ok. Again, everything was just ""ok"".My bill for three people including tea and service was $1,208. This is also ok. Not overly expensive for what I got, but not a bargain either.Basically, the Chinese Library is an average restaurant in a beautiful venue. For the moment, it will fillit\'s tables with tourists and visitors to Tai Kwun. However, it is unlikely to get a lot of repeat business given that it\'s location is slightly out of the way for business folks from Central and it faces a lot of competition from the hundreds of other restaurants around SOHO once the novelty of Tai Kwun wears off. For a restaurant like this to thrive, it needs to be spectacular. Unfortunately, The Chinese Library is very, very average.', 'Quick Squiz:Visited for a weekday lunch on recommendation of a friend who visited earlier. Impressive entrance and front desk service, welcoming bar staff as we walked past, exciting (and delicious) menu. Staff were still ""running-in"" with some unfamiliarity with menu and service protocol, but perhaps holding it back the most would be its price.More about the restaurant:Set in the newly opened Tai Kwun in Central, its address on the first floor of the former Police Headquarters instantly gives the place a special aura (I take issue with the official address on their name card reading ""Police Headquarters"". Either Tai Kwun needs to change the official name or Chinese Library needs to change theirs). Signage to the restaurant was lacking probably because it\'s still so new (it is not listed under restaurants at the Tai Kwun physical directory). Staff at the entrance (door, if you may, as it was an impressively imposing one) greeted us with confidence and offered to keep our umbrellas. Walking through the bar area to the restaurant involved being greeted with multiple friendly smiles and welcomes. Very inviting.The dining hall had an aura on entering, with furniture colour not unlike my cup of cappuccino. Perhaps the table right at the entrance was a little too close and open to everyone walking past though (still remember the two ladies looking up at us - and perhaps every other table of guests - entering the restaurant). Anyway, I digress.As a party of four, we were seated at one of their half-moon bench tables. Cushions rightfully plush with appropriate depth and height. Tableware design is welcomingly minimalistic with two sets of chopsticks per person. Table was a little small to fit a lot on it, but their staff kept tabs of our progress so the food wouldn\'t pile on at once. Admirably done.0On to the food - we were provided with multiple versions of menus (too many - really) - a standard a la carte menu, a dim sum menu and a lunch menu (which includes a selection of a la carte and dim sum menu items). We ordered from the a la carte menu and dim sum menu as they provided better choice. If I recall correctly, there were two lunch sets available, with one being at around HK$380 (same price as our a la carte). The lunch menu was otherwise too basic to provide real selection or to really appreciate their offerings.We ordered the following (unfortunately forgot to take a few photos):Chrysanthemum ""thousand cut"" silken tofu in chicken broth ($108 pp)Garoupa fillet with spring onion and ginger Cheung Fun Rice Rolls ($118)Taro puff with aubergine and salted fish ($58)Hokkaido king crab & sea urchin spring rolls ($118)PoachedChinese loofah & matsutake mushrooms ($148)Sweet & sour Iberico pork with dragon fruit & caramelised cashews ($208)Golden seafood fried rice & salted duck yolk ($188)Foie gras & wagyu beef stone pot fried rice ($235)Jasmine tea ($48 per pot)It was welcoming there were not other add-ons you\'d often get at Chinese restaurants (e.g. ""peanuts"" appetisers).Chrysanthemum ""thousand cut"" silken tofu in chicken broth...$ 1080Chrysanthemum ""thousand cut"" silken tofu in chicken broth...$ 108Chrysanthemum ""thousand cut"" silken tofu in chicken broth - stunning to look at and just as great in taste. Only gripe is the shape of the bowl made it hard to finish the last sip of the soup and to scoop up the last bits of tofu.Hokkaido king crab & sea urchin spring rolls$ 1180Hokkaido king crab & sea urchin spring rolls$ 118Hokkaido king crab & sea urchin spring rolls - a unique take on the good old spring roll. This was probably my favourite of all dishes - filled with crab meat and a refreshing sea urchin on top. With dishes like this, there is sometimes the dreaded contrast in temperature between cool filling (or topping) and hot pastry. No issues with this one. Nor did it feel oily at all.Garoupa fillet with spring onion and ginger Cheung Fun Rice Rolls/ Taro Puffs with aubergine and salted fish...$ 580Garoupa fillet with spring onion and ginger Cheung Fun Rice Rolls/ Taro Puffs with aubergine and salted fish...$ 58The Garoupa Cheung Fun was certainly a unique take on this Cantonese classic. Large thick pieces of fish wrapped in an overall well-made Cheung Fun. Two quintessential cantonese offerings (steamed fish and cheung fun) fused into one. Perfect. Two birds with one stone?Taro balls were also delish! The taste of aubergine (aka eggplant) in the taro puff went well with only the slightest hint of salted fish (which is great, in my books, as salted fish could easily overwhelm other flavours). Again, didn\'t feel oily at all.Sweet & sour Iberico pork with dragon fruit & caramelised cashews ...$ 2080Sweet & sour Iberico pork with dragon fruit & caramelised cashews ...$ 208Sweet and sour pork is a staple of my Chinese cuisine - have always liked the general flavour. This one had a very controlled flavouring - one which does not scream acidic (vinegar) nor overly sweet (or sticky). The meat was on the lean side with a bit more bite than your usual offering, which I relate to the Iberico pork. Might I suggest a few more dragonfruit ""flowers"" to carry its name? Portion of the meat was generous and something I would be keen to order again.Foie gras & wagyu beef stone pot fried rice$ 2350Foie gras & wagyu beef stone pot fried rice$ 235This is the foie gras and wagyu beef fried rice. As with the other fried rice we ordered, portions equate to four of these small bowls - on the small side really (I\'d have expected the equivalent of five as a standard portion). Flavour was great though, with the Golden seafood fried rice & salted duck yolk being the universal favourite.It was evident throughout the meal they were striving for five star service (which one would expect given the price) - wait staff kept control of the tea pot and refilled our cups whenever appropriate. My cup was empty for a good 10 minutes toward end of meal though, and the restaurant was far from busy, so it would be interesting to see if they would keep up when there is a full house (which I understand there has been, in the evenings). They should also check on the tea pots as tea always leaked onto the table when the staff were pouring (kudos that they came back to wipe the table dry after). Staff were polite, willing to help and visibly careful in what they were doing. As mentioned above, they kept great tab of our dining progress to keep the food coming at good intervals. However, if it was not because it is still \'new\', I would have given this 3 stars for the above handful of things which I would not otherwise expect at this price point. Hygiene was generally good except for a plate I received with water marks (you could see it in the photo above).Overall, it was a positive experience, with quite a number of items on the menu I would definitely and unreservedly recommend. Seating was comfortable and the ambiance suitable for the food. Air conditioning was weak (to the extent I felt there was none towards the end of meal). But the greatest disconnect would be its price (especially taking into account its location, for a weekday lunch) and service (which needs warming up). Cheaper and more convenient alternatives could be had for a similar price and impression in central Central (Clipper Lounge would be cheaper and Cafe Causette would be similar).'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-the-chinese-library/590531?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw
736,The Diner,Central,American,3.7,149.9,0.0,"Came here for late breakfast early lunch. We were a bit early for lunch but the staff was kind enough to make the lunch earlier for us. Surprised it was quite empty given the location. The breakfast is standard but the sliders were a bit disappointing. The fried chicken for the slider was dry and not much of taste. The decor is fun as its decorated like a traditional American diner. Looks like a cool place to hang out with friends after a long day of work. Chicken was a bit dry 0Chicken was a bit dry 0 Big hearty breakfast0 Big hearty breakfast0000', ""I have always been a little fan of The Diner - because it reminds me of the good times studying in the States - a very American neighbourhood style burger place! This time I asked a friend to try out its lunch set for the first time. $99 for a 2-course and $129 for a 3-course.We picked theOpen SandwichandSlidersas our choice of mains.For Sliders, there were pulled pork and fried chicken mini-sliders. I must say the deep fried chicken was so nicely done (although I usually don't really like deep fried chicken). The meat was so smooth while being excitingly and juicy! The pulled pork one was alright.0The Open Sandwich was GREAT for avocado fans like myself. It was presented in a way very similar to the avocado toast available in many brunch places. But for this one - you get the actual avocado instead of pastes. The chicken is also really nicely grilled!1For dessert we chose the Pecan Pie - I am such a nutty-tarty person. I almost finished the whole dessert without getting assistance from my friend. Again this dish really reminded me of the homemade pies and tarts every mom could master in downtown neighbourhoods in the States. Miss them!0The Diner is really a great choice for lunch (and in fact, for dinner as well). I personally am really into this place. But well - to give a more complete side of the story - the restaurant does not get as positive feedback from my friends. Many would think it's a soso burger place. From what I recalled I do think their burger steak was done just alright.I would say it probably still worth a try if you're looking for some new burger places.0"", ""Read on review this is one of top 10 burgers in HK, with skirt burger being the most famous one. Went on Sunday noon. Only to find out before 2pm on weekend they only have brunch menu, which doesnt include skirt burger.Disappointment didn't end there. I ordered only burger on the menu, the Dime burger. I asked for medium and was told it comes in medium. When it came, clearly was overcooked. Patty was on the small side. Only bright part was bacon was crispy.Service was average as well. One of waitresses told me normally they have 6 but only 2 on Sunday. Maybe that was why.Overall burger was small and overcooked. Very dry, not juicy at all. Really don't see how it could be top 10."", ""Came to The Diners on a late Thursday afternoon and were greeted by a very nice manager.I've been having way too many burgers lately so instead of ordering burgers, I got some nachos.

Nachos$ 980Nachos$ 98My friend ordered The Diner burger, he read it online that it was very good, but he's comment was the 4 burgers he had thru out the week at several other restaurants tasted better then this one... this burger was juicy and greesy but not as good as expected.

The only clue I could tell you is it's located besides Ovolo Hotel Soho and Cafe O, you can go up the escalator next to dragon-i.2Never been to the States but the interior looks pretty authentic American diner to me. We adore the floor tiles! The All-American $118; The Dime Burger $139; S'mores Milkshake $782The All-AmericanNormally I order a full breakfast when I feel like a boring person or I am really hungry, like really hungry. This is a pretty average full breakfast; egg, bacon, sausage, toast and hash browns (but no baked beans ugh!) There's really not much to say about this, prob not the dish I'd come back for. One side note: don't wait till the last minute to finish the pancake because it'll get cold and hard and taste disgusting!3The Dime BurgerI wouldn't say this burger is amazing but for a Sunday afternoon when you were so hungry because you woke at 2pm and not eaten all day, it's definitely good enough. The only thing I have to criticise is the patty being a bit under-flavoured. I actually really liked the sides, the chips were crispy and hot and the coleslaw was sour and refreshing, perfect for a heavy meal.1S'mores MilkshakeThis needs no fancy title, just simply a glass of goodness! This is certainly not that sorta milkshake for everyone, it's very dangerous yet very delicious. It's got a very strong vanilla base with chocolate syrup, and to top it off with the indulging marshmallow fluff, very sweet and fattening #calories #noshame! It would be even better if they add a handful of cinnamon crumbs on top nom! However, $78 for a cup of milkshake? I mean it's certainly a cup of pricey milkshake.0This is random I know, I only took this photo because I found this seat pretty bad ass! This place is a perfect place for fam jam on a Sunday afternoon.The Diner ; G/F, 4-8 Arbuthnot Road, Central"", 'All great change in America begins at the...dinner table.

And you\'ll find the answers very soon at The Diner (not exactly though...)The Diner proudly self-proclaims itself as ""Hong Kong\'s only authentic American Diner"", and it indeed seems so, with all the gluttonous treats such as milkshakes and burgers, you can\'t be too far off.

We advise to tuck those tasty bits back into the burger for enhanced flavours, but of course no one\'s stopping you from trimming them off! We topped up the meal with Pulled pork and cheese fries ($78), a delicious mixture of pulled pork, cheese and shoestring fries. The sweetness of the pulled pork was a surprisingly good complement to the fries, makes you wonder if everything does taste better with fries.

The smokey savory flavors will make you want to keep eating it, until sadly...it\'s finished.While the Diner hasn\'t solved all our questions regarding the Midwestern American 60s restaurant phenomenon, it has definitely given us HKers a good bite hot off the griddle.::||Good For||::burgers and fries with a shake, anyone?', 'It\'s been a long time waiting but finally there is a restaurnt that serves good ribs and american diner food in Central! I have now been to The Diner twice and both times I have been impressed with the quality of food there. First Impressions:The Diner is decorated in an American 1950\'s style diner with red booths and classic diner style interiors. The sign at the door says no reservations as they want to be authentic in the Diner style dining experience. We arrived at the restaurant for a late lunch and there was no waiting time as it was off peak. Previously I went there for lunch and still managed to get a seat pretty quickly. They play great music typical of what you might expect to hear in america, a lot of great blues and 50\'s and 60\'s rock and roll. I felt like I\'m in a ""Grease"" Movie which was cool. Menu:The menu is printed on the paper diposable placemats. They have the perfect selection of American favourites with the majority of the menu devoted to different types of burgers. However, they also serve salads including Caesarand Cobb salads. They have a beef burgerless selection which includes pulled port, chicken and veggie burgers. Plus they serve the classic sandwiches such as Club Sandwich. Don\'t get fooled by the ""Small Plates"" section, although the words used make it sound like a starter, the dishes are large and is sufficient as a main course. They also have a brunch menu which I can\'t wait to try. Hoping it will be an authentic american diner breakfast experience. What we ordered:We decided to go the ""Love me tender ribs"" and the ""Sunshine Burger"" and ordered a lemon ice tea and a mojito mocktail. The Ribs were as the decription says, TENDER and the homemade BBQ sauce was just the right combo of tangy and spice. I have to say that we have been looking for a place that serves great BBQ ribs in Hong Kong and have finally found it. These ribs are delicious, moist, tender and melt in your mouth. The portions is generous - you get 6 large meaty ribs for the price (HKD148) which I think is good value. The ribs are serves with a delicious and refreshing apple slaw. The sunshine burger was fresh and tasty. It comes with a fried egg, bacon, cheese and salad and supposedly a cripy onion ring, however my only gripe is that I think they must have forgotten the onion ring or ran out as there was caremalised onions in there instead. Would have been nice for them to have put the crispy onion ring in but the burger still tasted great without it. The dish is served with apple slaw and delicious thin crispy skin on french fries. The drinks were great, the mocktail mojito was yum, lots of lime and mint and perfect amount of sugar. Service:The first time I went, the service was just so so as it was lunch time and they only had one poor waitress serving but the second time was better, although there were not many customers in there at that time so not sure what it would be like when busy again. I hope they will make sure there are enough staff on the floor in the future. But overall, the wait staff were extrememly friendly. Ecouraged probably by the fact that the bill does NOT include a service charge and the wait staff must earn their tips from good service. I really like this as it encourages good service and you know they are actually getting the tips you leave instead of management pocketing it as in most other restaurants in HK. This is clearly stated on the menu. Verdict: We had a great experience and The Diner and will definately be back again. There are lots of other dishes that we would like to try still and it all looks pretty good. I highly recommend this place.Supplementary InformationService Charge Not included so tip you can on service qualityNo reservations available.'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-the-diner/176935?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

738,The Drawing Room,Central,Italian,4.7,450.0,0.0,"When the skies opened last Saturday unleashing a torrential downpour that ruined Clockenflap for me, my girlfriend and I decided to recalibrate and comfort ourselves with an indulgent brunch at The Drawing Room (TDR). It also happens to be right across from where I live on Staunton Street, which means we got to avoid walking too much under the rain.I had actually gone to TDR the night before only to get turned away at the door. Fully booked on a Friday night! Guess walking in is not an option here (on a weekend). Thankfully K had the good sense to call in advance and book us a table.0The SettingYou\'ll get decent outdoor views and natural lighting here. We would have loved to move in and out of the wide terrace for drinks / coffee / tea had the weather not been so appalling. I can imagine doing the al fresco thing here would be pleasant (I see it all the time from my bedroom window, and always thought ""lovely spot for tea and a book"")Layout is comfortably spaced out, arrangement is long like a corridor, so it doesn\'t feel like diners are concentrated.0While waiting for K to arrive, I entertained myself with the paper and colouring pencils they provided.

Does the name 'The Drawing Room' sound familiar? Well it should. The Drawing Room initially made waves in 2009 when it first opened in a small boutique hotel in Causeway Bay. It quickly made a real name for itself as one of the premier restaurants serving fine Italian fare in Causeway, dare I say, Hong Kong? The Drawing Room quickly garnered accolades, a Michelin star and an extremely loyal and hungry following. So when the restaurant closed down a few years back (for the time being) there were definitely more than a few people that were less than thrilled. But don't worry, because like I previously said, The Drawing Room is back and it's better than ever.Brought to you by the guys behind Drawing Room Concepts: they've successfully opened Ammo, Isono, Alma, Made in HK, Hainan Shaoye, and Hawker 18 to name a few. The Drawing Room is helmed by Chef Gabriele Milani and now sits pretty on the 7th floor at PMQ occupying the plum spot that was once Vasco.Alright enough chatter, lets get to the food.

739,The Drunken Pot,Causeway Bay,Chinese,4.6,160.0,5.0,"Having been working in cwb for a while, just realize this decent place for lunchThis restaurant was located at V Point 27/F, which was rather easy to find. Upon my arrival, the waiter just came out to greet me and and arrange seats for us. Warm serviceIt was 12:30 on a normal working day and the restaurant wasnt fully booked. We were arranged to sit next to the window side and the view was simply fantastic. I could see the whole Victoria Harbour view. This restaurant served set lunch and there were quite some choices in different styles. For example, it served Japanese sushi rice, Chinese steam rice and different small hot pots. Finally, I managed to order a set of Satay hotpot. 1) Daily Soup (): Carrot and corn soup in a cup. It tasted sweet and seemed not much additives added (at least I did not feel very thirsty This was the first time I drunk soup in a cup, just like coffee. Interesting2) Daily Salad (): Typical Japanese salad with seaweed and sashimi. Standard quality3) Steam Dumpling (): Seemed to me that it had been steamed for very long. It was not very juicy and the coating was rather think...4) Chiu Chow Satay Beef Hot Pot (): This is the spot of the lunch! Though it took a while to prepare (~15mins), it did not disappoint us. The soup was tasty, a not spicy but with lots of herbs. There were many toppings, such black sauage, toufu, cabbages,beef, etc. Each was well cooked and the black sausage stood out!

Firstly, steamed fresh prawns dumpling which i was unexpected that it had 2 BIG prawns inside and those were fresh n tasty. My favourite steamed egg sponge cake was soft and not too sweet, but a bit salty, which like wht i ate in some tranditional chinese restaurant in my childhoodAnd we ordered the deep fried pumpkin cake with red bean. Honestly, i was not reli interesting for something sweet, however, this one was not and both side of pumpkin cak was pan fried a little bit crisp, just the red bean was too much for me.

744,The Manchurian Candidate,Central,Chinese,3.6,70.0,,"This is a gem in bustling Central if you love spicy food. For under $50 or even less, you can enjoy a filling, pseudo-Sichuan meal. This is a private kitchen and completely home-run, with paintings a little kid drew hung around the walls of the apartment-like restaurant. Although the place is severely underfurnished, the tables are in fact less cluttered together than many other places in Central. When we came at exactly 12, we were the first few customers and were directed to a table with adequate space and privacy.The lunch menu is very simplethere is a range of Sichuan noodles from Dandan noodles to Zha Jiang (Fried Sauce) noodles () to Hot and Sour Sweet Potato Noodles (). These are all around $30-$50. We ordered one Dandan noodles for share and also had Sichuan Chicken (), Spicy Beef () and non-spicy stir-fried lettuce ().The food came in less than two minutes. The Dandan noodles look a bit different from usualneither the Japanese nor the Sichuanese variety. The soup is a clear (but slightly black) broth and the noodles are slightly grayish in color. The portion is big. The clear soup broth makes this a less heavy dish, as there is no sesame paste or peanut butter. Although there is no shredded pork topping, the soup is well seasoned and I almost had all of it. You will have to finish the noodles quickly if you dont want it to go soggy. This was a tasty dish, though I am not sure this should be called Dandan noodles at all!The Sichuan chicken comes as a cold dish and the chicken is cut into pieces. The meat is super tender and I loved this because I didnt have to pick out the bones. It also has a very special spicy sauce topping that is black in colora truly intense and memorable flavor. The portion size is very generous. This is just $30. No chili oil or peanut.The spicy beef also came as a cold dish. These are slices of lean beef boiled in fermented chili bean paste and soy saucethe Sichuan peppercorns leave your tongue with a lingering numbing sensation. This wasnt greasy and the beef slices were mostly tender, although I was unable to chew on some of them.The vegetables were crispy and juicy and helped soothe our burning tongues.Service was great. They deliver for orders above $150. I would highly recommend the place for casual lunches to those who love spicy food.

745,The Mast of Mozzarella & Co.,Causeway Bay,Italian,3.6,130.0,0.0,"The Mast of Mozzarella & Co is a restaurant originally from Rome, Italy. Their concept? A restaurant, delicatessen and production lab all in one space. The design is white and bright. Clean and well ... sterile. I remember eating there as it was near my hotel in Rome. It was a good place for a quick sandwich before moving on to touristy things. So, when I found that this same place had opened a walk away from my home, I decided to give it a try.Their design is much like the one in Rome. It's also white in decor. But perhaps due to the lack of windows, it's a bit more darker inside. It's also not a very big space so they have everything a bit cramped. Like they randomly placed pasta and sauces for sale in one corner instead of one lovely space like in Rome. There is a small viewing area where you see them making fresh buffalo millk mozzarella and burrata. But it's so small compared to the one in Rome, I felt a bit sorry for the man cramped inside that tiny little room. I guess I can only say to the Italians: Welcome to Hong Kong. Land of the lack of space.0The menu is in English and Chinese. Servers all speak English. There is no one that speaks Cantonese. They serve pasta, salad, panino, pizza and burgers. Your basic popular Italian though the menu wasn't as extensive as the one in Italy. Understandable as they probably want to test the local market. Everything is available for dine in (which they add 10% service charge) or take away. You can even just buy the cheese to go.0010000000During lunch time, they have a lunch set menu that changes weekly. It comes with a soup or salad. Add $10 for a regular coffee or tea. And when they weren't kidding when they said it was regular. I added for an ice tea and it was not only tiny but yeah .. regular. So, I'd save that $10 and drink the free water. Stress tap water because they'll ask if you want sparkling or still. This isn't Italy where no one drinks tap and people drink bottled water. I guess they aren't used to that yet.0As it was my first time here, I decided on the set lunch. Soup of the day was a tomato soup. It was thick and had a intense tomato flavor. Crunchy croutons were placed on top to give it a bit of texture. I found they added some basil as well.0I decided on the panino salame ($108) as I wanted try the mozzarella. I was on the edge for the burrata as I love burrata more but I knew I'd have a busy work day ahead so I wanted something a bit more filling. This came with a side of salad which was lightly dressed with a basic vinaigrette. The salad greens were ok but I did love the cherry tomatoes more as they were extremely sweet.The sandwich was stuffed with a lot of salami and mozzarella with crunchy lettuce and toasted multi cereal ciabatta. A regular ciabatta I'm used to but this? This felt like a healthy beast. The bread was fantastic (though a bit too toasted in some parts). It was covered in so many grains and pine nuts. The salami was wonderful. Not too salty at all. And the cheese? Soft and chewy yet firm. This was really good cheese.0Service was fine though wasn't checked on like the other people around me. Not that I mind as I hate being interrupted while I eat but still was odd that I wasn't asked how I was doing or if it was my first time here. Suddenly, I felt like I was in Rome all over again where I was ignored at a deli as I wasn't blonde like the girl next to me. Food is fine and not overly expensive. I will be back and decide to go a la carte. The lunch sets aren't too interesting and I'd rather see how they fare on something else. Plus, it's good to see a place in Hong Kong that makes their own fresh buffalo mozzarella and burrata and I would probably take some home.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-the-mast-of-mozzarella-co/605281?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
746,The Match Box,Causeway Bay,Chinese,3.7,40.0,5.0,"The environment was full of oily smell, my friends and I did feel that our clothes were cover with that smell too! It was the first time I ordered the normal set, the fried egg with ham was a bit overcooked with lot of burnt egg in it, the portion was too small too!', ""Attracted originally by the dcor and the type of food they serve here in Matchbox, I brought a friend here to try out the food. Honestly we were quite pleased with this new-style bing-sutt, even though its slightly out of reach. Upon stepping inside we were in love already! After being seated to a mini booth we studied the menu, and decided on the following...We picked two items to share, one being their signature meal set of chicken pie in pea soup with pancakes ($38) which comes with a drink - we ordered 'B Jai Yin Yang' for an extra $5. The other item was a very normal beef and tomato rice (, just to be safe!The chicken pie in pea soup was a little strange for us, but not bad at all. We agreed we would've preferred eating them separately, and I shall bare that in mind for next time! Here at Matchbox the chicken pie is a Hong Kong-style pie, being made with a sweet shortcrust pastry crust and only a little filling of chicken breast in white sauce with mixed vegetables. The crust was in no way soggy despite being served in the soup, and was quite rich, but good. The pea soup proved to be better than I thought. Green peas are probably one of my most hated vegetables, and this soup in no way resembled the boring old pea. It was flavoured with lots of ginger and pured, so it was a hearty and healthy contrast to the pie. Pancakes came with a light caramel flavoured sauce and chopped bananas. The pancakes were warm when served, and nicely browned on both sides and soft on the inside. The caramel sauce is not your typical caramel sauce, this one being lightened by the addition of (corn) starch, which also makes it less-sweet! Although some might think they aren't being genuine, serving 'fake' caramel and all, it is actually the preferred taste of many Chinese people who don't like their sweets too sweet any way! Of course it would've been better if served later, but then again we should have told them to - this is a cha chaan teng after all. Beef and tomato on rice ($42) was good as well. Whilst the rice could've been better, the beef was soft but not too much so as a result of tenderizing ingredients (yes, baking soda), and the tomatoes were chopped small enough before being fried so they cooked thoroughly and softened easily, rather than being semi-raw big chunks which I got from Tsui Wah recently. Also in here were button mushrooms, and the main character - the tomato sauce, was not overly acidic and not too sweet either, a wonderful balance!

We were all interested as we have always seen lineups at this place. It took about 10 minutes before we were seated. The restaurant was full so it was expected that service would be slower than usual, however over the course of our lunch we found out that it was not only the speed to be the issue, the service is totally unacceptable. As mentioned after being seated, it took about 10 minutes in order to get attention of the waitress to help us take our order. We ordered the lunch menu and upon ordering the soup and main, the waitress ran off before we could order our drinks. During the whole process she stood there with no expression and did not bother to repeat our order. Our table was then set up in front of us. 3 sets of plates were put down. You must be blind not to see how dirty the plates were. All three plates were still dripping wet, one of them had a full piece of spaghetti laying across the top of the plate. The other two had tomato sauce smeared on the plate. We couldnt tell whether those plates were just not washed well or they just served us used plates. We immediately requested plate changes. Those plates did not return until about 20 minutes later after we requested for it again, after our pizza and pasta have arrived. All three of the plates were then still wet, and we requested to change 2 the plates as it has oranged tomato sauce still smeared all over it.So what happened to our soup you may ask? About 10 minutes after our main course has arrived, they decided to let us know that there was no lobster bisque left. It took 30 minutes for them to let us know they are out of stock. With no choice left we told them to just give us the salad instead. However, about 10 minutes after that the waitress came back to say that we could we served mushroom soup instead which we took. At this point we were able to get her attention and we ordered our drinks. The rest of our order came shortly after. My friend who ordered a coffee having not realized that it was being served with cream already inside requested to have it changed for a black one. At that point we were finished with our meal. 20 minutes have passed and still no coffee. We waved the waitress over to ask whether we would get another cup of coffee, in which she replied ""yes"" and left. During our wait of our coffee, which ended up about 30 minutes we over heard and witnessed what only solidified our how we felt about their service. The table beside us called over the waitress and confronted her for her bad attitude and service. The conversation went along the lines of ""When I talk to you, you give me no expression and do not acknowledge you hear me, I do not know whether you can hear me or if you understand chinese or english. And above all, when you try to talk to me I can not hear you at all, it seems you are mumbling to yourself"".About the food. We ordered, mushroom soup, chicken alfredo spaghetti, spaghetti bolognese, and their carnivore pizza. The alfredo had good flavor, the bolognese was a let down. It had barely any taste at all. The pizza was medicore, like any other pizza you could get anywhere. Overall I thought the food was acceptable for the price. I would not come back again due to the poor service and hygiene. I cannot imagine myself or anyone eating with those dirty utensils and dishes. It does not take much effort to inspect whether the dishes are clean and dry but these people were too lazy to even do that. No excuses can be made for serving plates with wet piece of spaghetti on it or tomato sauce over it.. multiple times.

I ordered the Creamy Salmon bowl and for the cost I thought it would be fresher and there'd be a more generous use of the key ingredients. The salmon was tough and I found it almost inedible.

I can safely say that all of it was just meh. 0Nothing special and I would not be back for it. The spaghetti was okay, cooked well but the sauce was very plain and lacked seasoning and depth.

Its not much, but why?! The cream soup was pretty much awful bland and of canned quality.  Contrastingly, the piece of garlic bread that came with it was quite nice, albeit soft instead of crispy, and obviously not fresh.  Finally  the pasta.  I couldnt help but stare at it for a moment, disappointment washing up all over me.  ?? Au gratin?? There was not a tiny bit of cheese on it.  It wasnt even baked.  It appeared to be just pasta tossed in sauce  really oily sauce, too.  I wasnt impressed.  Anyhow, I had to eat it.  The lobster flavour was artificial, and anyway, I just couldnt get over the cheeselessness.  I probably emptied the whole jar of grated cheese that was on the table.  Not very satisfying, especially when you were expecting a dish of bubbly, golden, melted cheese atop your pasta.

Better than specialists.Good soba.Great value.May get a bit noisy during lunchtime and services need improvement.However, great value, good quality - recommended!>>>>I walked past ""the Yuu"" many times after having ramen at "" Hanchi ban"", ""Yukitei"" or other restaurants at Qre plaza. I\'ve tried the Yuu at Knutsford Terrace, TST, but wasn\'t too impressed with neither the price nor the portion, other than the """" soft egg rolls/omelet rolls with mirin, salt and various fillings like crab meat. It\'s extremely important to keep the middle part soft and gooey. The Yuu\'s was pretty good and had egg taste, similar to the very famous one at ""the Mon"". The yakitori was just average, however.  Because of my previous experiences with the Yuu at TST, I wasn\'t too interested in trying this out until I saw from other reviewers that they apparently specialized in tempura, my all time favorite type of Japanese food! () It brings back childhood memories as it\'s probably the first Japanese cuisine I\'ve ever tried as a kid. I suspect it\'s the same for most of us here? (OK, instant noodles and cup noodles don\'t count! ) They apparently bought a tempura ""stove""(?) in order to increase the authenticity. I am not aware of any particular equipment necessary other than a frying pan with hot oil and a separate pot of batter to dip whatever you fancy in. My wife\'s grandmother and mother used to make it at home. I believe the stove might be an equipment similar to those used to fried chips (?), keeping the oil at a constant temperature and perhaps contains a timer ? (Like the chip fryer in McDonalds). Well, it\'s like Japanese fish & chips!  In addition to the tempura, I noticed from other reviewers that they also do hot and cold soba! This really put it on my ""must try "" list .I finally got the chance to try it over a late lunch one day (at about 1:40 pm.) It was surprisingly packed!  Environment: The restaurant was divided into different areas. Seats in front of the sushi bar, normal tables for four persons and some tatami areas near the window for about eight persons. The whole restaurant was decorated in a dark brown/black wooden panels.  I told the waiter at the door that I wanted a seat for 1. I was duly brought to a table with two lovely ladies, whom (^_), unfortunately, I did not know.  Being a really shy General, I refused that allocation immediately as I find it very awkward both for them and for me, especially when the table was really quite small and when there were single counter seats available at the sushi bar. Funny why it never occurred to him to ask where I wanted to sit. Another illustration of how you must take charge of your own life and not let others dictate how you live! Again, I digress. I sat at the leftmost corner seat of the whole shop. There was a wall on my left and a partition behind me. I certainly had a lot of private space and which was quite comfortable.Service:On the other hand, the problem was exactly that - no one could see me - except the Sushi Chef!  I tried to flag down a waitress who told me to wait for a little while, which I quietly complied. I was handed the menu after a 2-3 minutes wait.  The menu was comprehensive, which included sashimi, sushi, yakitori and other grilled food, many different types of tempura sets, eel rice, hot soba (in soup) & cold soba, as well as their famous egg rolls (Tamagoyaki). I knew what I wanted to order before I came so the decision was relatively easy, ""Assorted Tempura Set"" with Cold Soba. The set originally came with hot soba in soup, which I dislike, as it tends to affect the texture of the soba. Luckily, I was able to switch it to cold soba. When i was ready to order, I flagged down a waitress, who told me to wait. I didn\'t mind waiting for a while as it seemed very busy outside. However, it eventually took 10 minutes before anyone came to take the order. And I might have to wait even longer if the kind sushi chef didn\'t help me drew their attention, thrice!  This is frankly, quite unacceptable especially when some waiters had the time to pour tea and leisurely arrange dishes on others customers tables, which was not something that urgent.  Fortunately, I did not leave the restaurant. It took the waiters 10 minutes to place my order but only 10 minutes for my set to arrive! The kitchen was, fortunately, very efficient. I was pretty sure that they made tempura fresh to order because I could smell the chef frying it from the open kitchen. The tempura came after a short wait, much to my surprise, even faster than the cold soba! Tempura:When it arrived, I figure it might be worth the wait after all. This was because of the green tea salt placed on the top left hand corner of the nice ceramic dish.  One way to eat tempura is not to dip it in sauce but in salt instead . This applies especially to seafood, i.e. the prawn and other fishes. It really brings out the fresh seafood taste. This is what I\'ve learn from my father-in-law and I was hooked to this way of having tempura ever since.So I was quite pleased when they gave me the tempura with green tea salt. 0 This was what the set composed of:Shishamo: The timing of  this fish was very good. No part of the fish was overcooked - which is quite hard to do. Still fairly tender. The fish roes were very flavourful and the meat tender.Shiso : Surprisingly fresh and not too oily. It had a slight tangy taste to it.Crab Stick:  Of course it\'s real crab meat. Very sweet and juicy. I really liked it. This could be very expensive in tempura shops in Japan or ""specialists"" tempura shops in Hong Kong ($60-$150 for one piece of crab stick). You really can\'t beat the price here. Kuruma ebi :  Surprisingly good!  Decent texture had shrimp taste. The frankly speaking, quality was not wildly different from those provided at ""Inagiku"". Certainly, I suppose at Inagiku they use live shrimps whereas they might have used frozen shrimps here. Those at Inagiku might be a bit firmer with a bit more seafood taste but you\'ll need to pay at least triple the price of this meal just for the shrimp alone. In view of that, those at the Yuu did an excellent job. Better than the pretty good tempura I had at ""Take no Sato"" (at Hung Hom) ""New Kotobuki"" (Jordan), ""Zen Tsuru"" (Hung Hom) ""Ihei"" (TST) and ""Ryo Tei"" (Sheung Wan).Fried Ebi head: No complaints. Just be careful when you eat it. It can be quite a pain in the mouth.Pumpkin:  Not too oily. Not overwhelmingly sweet. Just right.Eggplant:  Very fresh. Definitely one of the best I\'ve tried in Hong Kong.Japanese whiting:  Very good. This was surprisingly warmer, crispier, tastier and fresher than Iwanami () or Tenyoshi.  All in all, I was very happy with the tempura set.  I think most tempura so-called specialists shops are simply overpriced with average food quality. At HK$130 for such good quality tempura, I can recommend this restaurant to anyone.  HK$130 plus service was worth the wait. Don\'t forget about the soba :1 The quality of the soba was very decent. The texture was quite hard. The soba should have a high soba ratio. I think it\'s a bit harder than the ones provided by ""Ootoya"". This type of hard soba is very good in hot soup. So I suspect the duck soup soba might be worth trying as well.Condiments: The restaurant provided customers with real wasabi and decent spring onions. However, I believe the spring onions were local ones and not Japanese Banno Negi . Banno Negi has a slightly sharper and spicier taste. The taste of the spring onions provided here were not that pronounced.A quail egg was also provided. You could mix it into the soba sauce if you wish. Not everyone does that. In fact, I seldom see quail eggs provided in Japan.The soba soy sauce was reasonably strong. No complaints. It\'s stronger then the sauce provided at ""Kurotaki"". The key difference between Kurotaki and the YUU is that Kurotaki, being the soba soup specialist , provides you with soba soup. There is no soba soup available here. Conclusion:Service at the shop front was so so. Polite but very slow. Luckily, the staff in the kitchen was very fast.  Seats: For some reason, they do the cha chaan teng style of allocating seats - you\'ll be randomly allocated to a table with other customers whether you want to or not. The place was quite spacious however. There are counter seats for one and tatami seats for larger groups. Not extremely quiet. Pretty nice decor.Food: Not withstanding the really slow service at first, the tempura set was very good! Definitely equal to, if not better than, many tempura specialist shops. You can\'t beat the price.The soba was also better than ""Kurotaki"". A bit hard than Ootoya. I think the soba at both Ootoya and the Yuu (Wan Chai) are good.Price: HK$130 for such a decent set was worth the wait. Recommended. 0: x 2 )   : ""Kiss\'! Yoshi.! !!

Another scene was at Yokozuna Ramen!', ""Had friend popped into my office this morning and asked if I had time for a quick lunch so since Hopewell Centre is just a couple of blocks over, we decided to head over there.  When my friend said that he doesn't eat meat anymore, then Yuu was the only choice I could think of.The wait was short, only about 5 mins but we had to sit at a table for 4 people and share the table with another couple. Thankfully the couple ate really fast and left even before our food came so we had the table to ourselves.My friend ordered the sushi cubes on rice which he said was very fresh and the rice was done to perfection.  It came with lukewarm miso soup and a pickled lotus root appetizer.0I ordered the sushi set that came with udon and the lotus root appetizer.  The udon came before the sushi which was very disappointing because I was not going to eat the hot food before cold, it's not proper to serve that way.  The sushi was ok but the best piece hands down was the Ika.0"", ""There are lots of newish restaurants in Hopewell Centre and surroundings. I have been to the Portugese restaurant and Cucina at QRE centre as well as Le Bons Cafe in the next building. We wanted to go to Nha Trang for lunch but since we parked at Hopewell and it was raining hard, we didn't want to cross the foot flyover with my parents, and my daughter fussed about not going to a Dim Sum restaurant on the 7/F, so we ended up at The Yuu, a King Parrot group restaurant. In the past, I have always found their restaurants nicely decorated and the food of a high enough standard. There were 5 of us and we tried Crabmeat omelette was quite sweet but the texture of the egg was smooth and there was quite a lot of crab inside. Some sweet soup came out of the egg when it was bitten and we all liked this dish  Deep fried bean curd was worse than most I have had. Not crispy on the outside, texture non descript and sauce quite tasteless, like eating nothing  Avocado and crabmeat roll was delicious. Big chunks of crab and fresh avocado slices on top. Nicely presented and almost a pity to ruin the look  Deep fried pork cutlet. My mum really liked this dish. She doesn't like to eat much these days but kept going back for more. So it must be good.  Grilled eel rice in stone pot came and the waitress mixed it for us. Unlike the Korean version, there was no hot paste and the kimchee never came with it. Anyway, it was a bit bland, however tasty and the eel was soft and flavoursome.  Tempura is one of the signature dishes here as the restaurant sells itself as a sushi and tempura restaurant. There were lots of variety of items including uni in seaweed, squid, sweet potato, the usuals and a bunch of spring onions chopped and shaped into a stick. No one had this piece  Fried mixed vegetables with tomatoes was a bit of a waste of vegetables. It came in a red sauce that didn't look right and the vegetables were drowned in this. Some skinless marrows tasted limp and liveless. NO! Lastly, a bowl of soba with wild vegetables were tasteless and the soba overcooked and hence had no bite. Again can be skipped.This restaurant has a nice surrounding and is bright as it has a whole side of glass. It makes me think it may be like copying the very successful the Mon in Causeway Bay. We can never get a table at the Mon even if we book on the day. However, it is a nice enough place for a Sunday lunch and because we don't eat sashimi, the cost was very reasonable00000000""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/wan-chai-the-yuu-japanese-dining/37597?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

This cheesy mochi came it HOT. and the skin was lightly crisp unlike the ones you tried outside which felt like they\'ve fried it over and over again.When you cut the mochi in half...O-EM-GEE. The cheese poured out... all over. Just a wonderful scene. Please forgive me that I didn\'t take a photo of the flowy cheese for u  What about the taste?? FANTASTIC!

I picked the tiger curry with the original level of spice. It was tad bit of spicy but it greatly enhanced the curry flavor some something just plain salted to.. slightly spicy and sweet. I\'ve never tasted such flavor before. This flavor isnt the ones you can taste from a chained restaurant. The sauce wasn\'t as thick, which i really appreciated. The scramble egg was smooth, juicy, and perfectly flavored. It was the first part that i tasted actually > < I tried it with and without dipping into the curry sauce and i loved both!!!!  The pork chop was great too! The cripsy skin wasnt too thick that covered that juiciness of the pork chop.

759,"Tim Ho Wan, the Dim-Sum Specialists",Central,Chinese,4.5,77.5,15.0,"My husband and I consider ourselves dim sum experts since we grew up in New York's chinatown so we were convinced that a Michelin rated dim sum restaurant can't be that much better than what we can get in New York. We were wrong. Tim Ho Wan deserves its Michelin star and the crazy crowds that wait to be fed. We were a party of eight and we ordered almost half of the menu. First of all, it only turned out to be about $10 USD per person, but more importantly the food was incredible. Everyone talks about how good the roast pork buns are - and it's true! Sweet and savory with the tastiest pieces of roast pork and the right amount of sauce. I also loved the beef meatball - the best I ever had and the sticky rice in bamboo leaves came with so much meat! Of course the Sui Mai and the rice rolls and shrimp dumplings were yummy too! The one thing I would not recommend is the turnip cakes...they were pretty bland and not befitting of this delicious place! Definitely go if you are in Hong Kong. Go twice, if you can!"", 'Back to Tim Ho Wan and the procedure. Put your name down, get your piece of paper, fill it out, provide once your name is called, sit down, eat, sip, leave. This is no space to be quietly contemplating anything. There are so many people outside waiting with their pencils and pieces of paper, with looks of consternation, that you would think we are at the races. My tip here, which no doubt goes without saying, is get here as early as possible and be prepared to wait. We arrived about 11.45am and were seated shortly after midday so all was good.The dim sum is delivered fresh based on your order. At THW we had marked down the several dishes, savoury and sweet, that we wanted, so we knew the exact cost (plus service) for our meal. Dishes then arrive once they are ready in no particular order with sweets accompanying savouries. The apparent go-to dish is the baked pork buns. The dough has a touch of sweetness that is not overpowering but combines well with the gorgeous pork filling. There is a nice texture there from the baking, rather than steaming.Almost every dish was excellent including the har gow (steamed prawn dumplings) and the black sticky rice cream. Though the main standouts other than the buns included the ""tonic medlar and petal cake"" which is definitely a classic dish often differently described. I believe it is made with chrysanthemum tea and petals but I\'m really not sure. In the end it is a delicious, slightly sweet, textural jelly that is the perfect cleanser. The other standout was the glutinous rice or lo mai gai. This classic dish, wrapped in lotus leaves, contains chicken, Chinese sausage (tastes like blood sausage here), mushrooms and several other base ingredients. The perfume from the steamed lotus leaf provides an attractive introduction to what is a dense, decadent, and rich package of rice and meat. The only let down in the THW script was the seasonal vegetable being steamed iceberg lettuce. In any cuisine steamed iceberg lettuce is disappointing.'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-tim-ho-wan-the-dim-sum-specialists/61957?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

The lunch set came with miso soup and salad appetizers - those were the usual. The diced sashimi was quite fresh and one could taste the different flavors from the various ingredients easily. I liked the sashimi rice which had the right balance of vinegar and softness. One needed to bear with the very crowded eating area though - customers were so tightly squeezed together that they would elbow one another if a sudden movement was made. The service was acceptable; given the very few number of servers. They only accept cash like small eateries do, so patrons should come prepared. At $163, it's quite an attractive price for such quality food - so a revisit is very likely. 00"", ""It seems whenever I leave my home and walk over to Causeway Bay, there is always something new. This is a new place that features donburi. Located along the same street as Ichiran, is this very tiny shop with no English name. Well, there is: Toyo Katte Don. In Hoikkaido style.0Menu is Chinese only. It's cash only and no 10% service charge. There is no English but there are photos of the various chirashi for those undecided people who never know what to choose.0Or you can create your own chirashi by checking off what you want from a checklist.0For those that want photos of the ingredients, that is available, too.0As I wasn't sure what to order, I decided to try their roasted eel set ($168) as I haven't had unagi in a long time! I had a weird sudden craving. This was two different types of eel (unagi and anago). It was topped with a slice of processed cheese. This was a bit different than the previous photos I saw on Openrice where the cheese was not there. The staff informed me it was a new item. I think I preferred it with the cheese as it really didn't add to it and was a bit rubbery in taste as processed cheese usually is. I got a big slice of eel that was moist. Though a a few parts were a bit burnt. I guess too torch happy that day? But other than that, the meat was at least moist. The rice was ok but I think I would have wanted a bit of sauce so it wasn't too dry.1Set included a miso soup. This was ok. Like your typical miso soup.0Two appetizers were also part of the set. This was pretty good. A braised daikon. The daikon was sweet and soft. I liked it. Probably my favorite from the set.0The other appetizer was a seaweed salad that also had a slice of tomato and some grated onion. I think way too much grated onion but it was ok.0I added a drink though free water is available. This is an apple cider ($36). This was really good and I wonder where they get this from as I'll probably stock up caseloads of it. The amount of carbonation wasn't too much but just enough to give it a fizz. It basically tasted like apple juice with a touch of fizz. Almost as good as Martell's apple cider.0Fairly reasonably priced meal.

One of the options was to choose three mini dons that will come with a bowl of udon. And if you don't want raw food, they have vooked rice bowls as well. Why someone would come here to eat non sushi type items as that is their selling point is beyond me, but it happens. But I wasn't too interested in that. I wanted the premium don!

It also included half an egg with a superior runny yolk. Mixing it all up, this was a pretty delicious. But size portion for this price, I could get just as good elsewhere and for a bigger portion.0Overall, the sides were average. But the sushi was very fresh. Portion size was a lot smaller than I had expected. Would I be back? Unsure. But for this price range, it really isn't that bad. Just the portions were pretty small. Only worth it if there is no queue. If there is a queue, go elsewhere."", 'Another one of the most hype  restaurants last month is definitely the  locates in Wan Chai.  It is one of the famous fish store in Tsukiji oversea branch. First of all, it opens at 12pm so basically you needs to be there around 1130am, so you can get in for the first round of lunch.  It offers various type of fresh japanese seafood bowl .  The restaurant inside is comfortable as you wont feel super crowded.We have been to quite a few japanese  restaurant but few can matches the freshness of .  We ordered the snow crab and fatty toro for sharing.  Both are considered top notch quality that matches well with soy sauce and wasabi.  The table next to us ordered the special premium.  However, based on the look and their conversation, it seems not worth it as the portion is not good enough for two as it has suggested on the menu.  As the restaurant has labeled all seafood come directly from Tsukiji , so you can expect the quality must be good.  It is a norm in Hong Kong that such hype may last for a while, therefore, most likely you will need to wait for 30 or 45 minute in order to get it.  So if you are a  fan, go and give it a try as you mostly wont disappoint.

774,Trois Petites Gaufres Restaurant & Cafe,Causeway Bay,Italian,1.6,86.0,0.0,"Came here for lunch as I saw that Ocio closed and they had a sign that said ""look for our new concept"". Seeing as this ""new concept"" opened, I came to give it a try.I don\'t know why OpenRice calls this place ""TPG Restaurant"" when it says ""Trois Petites Gaufre Restaurant & Cafe"" on the front. But it gives this fancy French name which basically means ""Three Small Waffles"". Waffles were what Ocio was famous for and this is just their new concept for making themselves serve ""French/Italian"" food at a higher price while also serving their famous waffles. I\'m not a big fan of Ocio and their waffles. I always found them a bit too crunchy and over cookied.0It appeared that Ocio didn\'t bother to change their interior other than putting a few ""French"" paintings on the walls. I noticed the staff was the same as before.0Lunch menu ranged from $75 - 88 and included a daily soup or French-style salad, main and coffee or tea. I asked what the soup of the day was and they informed me it was cream of celery. Not really wanting to have cream of celery, I choose the French-style salad and gnocci in pomodoro and basil sauce. I added a regular coffee.menu1menuWhat is a French style salad? When I think of a French style salad, I think immediately a nioise salad with a wonderful scattering of hard boiled egg. What I got was a lot of frisee, four slices of cherry tomato and a very small drizzle of balsamic vinaigrette. I don\'t know what part of this they can call this ""French style"" because not one part was French of any style at all. There was just not enough salad dressing and the taste of frisee was so bitter, I thought to myself that this is possibly the worst salad I\'ve ever had. I love salad but I really didn\'t like this salad. At all.French salad0French saladGnocci in pomodoro and basil sauce was also not very good. The gnocci was dense and heavy. The tomato sauce (which they fancied it up by calling it ""pomodoro"" which is tomato in Italian) just tasted like pureed tomato with mouthfuls of raw rosemary and a sprinkle of dried basil. It wasn\'t even fresh basil. And why the addition of rosemary let alone raw rosemary? It made the sauce horrible.gnocci in pomodoro and basil sauce0gnocci in pomodoro and basil sauceI chose the coffee with my meal. I really don\'t have high expections for the coffee but this was the worst coffee I ever had. It tasted like water that was brown in color. I rarely not finish my cup of coffee but I couldn\'t finish this one. No matter how much sugar, milk, whatever ... it still tasted like water. Even McDonald\'s makes a better brew than this.They may have fancied up the place by giving it fancy names and raising the prices, but the food was not very good.

776,Trusty Gourmet,Wan Chai,Chinese,2.0,47.5,0.0,"Arrived the restaurant @12:15 (make sure before lunch time and expect to leave before 1:00 pm).  Their service was terrible, rude, no manner, kept pushing for orders (I understood they wanted the table back before 1:00 pm, but it is not the way to do business). We ordered , ,  and .  First the  was overdone (what a waste).     and  is just so so (sorry the restaurant is over complimented).  If you are fond of traditional , you are at the wrong place, the mix of their special soup and  are wrong combination.  Overall, won't go back."", ""** Appologies, Photo lost  **My friend highly recommended this restaurant for its soup and noodles bowl, so we went to try it out today and see if it was that great. Apparently the most brilliant aspect in Trusty Gourmet was its soup - there were about six soup choices on the menu, while the noodles was additional sides that you could add in to your soup accordingly to your preference, just in case you won't be full solely drinking the soup. There was an ad on the wall, promoting a private kitchen styled dinner by a Chinese chef called 'Brother Peter'. Another glance over the cashier, you might find Br. Peter managing the cash counter. There was several dishes stating they were especially prepared by Br. Peter, then shouldn't Chef Peter stayed at the kitchen? I kept wondering. I ordered Fish Maw and Pork Bones with Dumplings () and added rice noodles. There weren't any fish maw in my soup but I actually didn't expect there was any judging by the price anyway. To be blunt, I personally reckon the soup wasn't that special at all, the taste was quite light in taste. Adding to the fact that it was just a plain soup, it gave a feeling that there did not use much ingredients used to braise the soup. The soup tasted more like a noodle broth than soup to me. The noodles wasn't that particularly special either. The dumplings were meat dumplings, the wrapper was quite thin and the meats were tender enough. However I don't personally like meat dumplings without a single bit of veggies in it, it was just boring to me.To Conclude, I reckon the restaurant used the soup as a gimmick and make the noodles optional. It is pretty pointless to me, who on earth would just solely order the soup without any noodles? It simply wouldn't fill your stomach. Moreover the fact that all four of us didn't finish half the soup suggested the soup really wasn't that good at all. The bowl of soup with noodles could be find in any noodle restaurants served as a noodle bowl but switch-able noodle type. There won't be a revisit from me.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/wan-chai-trusty-gourmet/35251?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw
777,Tsim Chai Kee Noodle,Central,Chinese,3.7,34.5,2.0," (English name : Tsim Chai Kee Noodle) is a perhaps one of my favorite places to have noodles when I'm in Central. And apparently, so did the Michelin Guide as it's listed in one of it's recommended places to eat in Hong Kong. Located literally across the street from the famous more tourist crowded Mak's Noodles, I honestly prefer Tsim Chai Kee to Mak's and I tell my tourist friends to go here instead.A small noodle shop that sells three basic items: wonton, fish balls and sliced beef. Menu is in English and Chinese. There is no 10% service charge.0The noodles I always order is this. A double whammy of wonton and fish balls for an inexpensive $37. Portion size is alright. It's not too big and not miniscule in size like Mak's. The wontons are large with a good mixture of pork meat and one huge shrimp wrapped around a thin wrapping. But my favorite? The HUGE HUGE fish balls made from dace. They are so big they always make me smile from the size. And they are fantastic. Unlike other places that use dace meat, a fish that has a lot of bones, there are hardly found in their balls. The balls are firm and has that nice bouncy texture. The soup is a clear shrimp based broth though there is a bit of MSG detected. The noodles are firm and perfectly al dente.0So, if you see a long line at Mak's Noodles, perhaps try this one across the street. Definitely a better bowl."", 'great wanton with two juicy prawns in each dumpling, as well as a tasty fish ballthe soup was lovely and the egg noodles were nice and Al dente 0', 'a Waton noodle cost $28 is very reasonalbe in central district.0i order aWonton rice noodle. as theWaton & noodle are cooked, so it could be served quickly.10it contained 3 bigWonton, bigger than nornal size. wrapped with shrimp and pork. but the soup tasted like water........', ""Note that it's a small establishment, so be prepared to share tables with strangers!Loved the fact that each bowl only cost $25 upwardsU have 3 toppings to choose from:- King Prawn Wantan - big, juicy prawn wantans.

778,Tsuen Kee,Wan Chai,Chinese,3.7,30.0,0.0,"Talking about Beef Brisket Noodles in Wan Chai, I would usually think of Tsuen Kee, as this was the place where I was brought up with. Today I had this sudden crave for Beef brisket so I went to have lunch in Tsuen Kee. Luckily there were seats available, so I do not need to wait for a seating. There was indoor and outdoor seatings, which under this hell temperature, there was no way I am sitting out. The indoor decor was simple with white tiles, wooden tables and stools. There wasn't any AC but there were several fans around each of every corner of the restaurant. Guess what, I was sitting at one of the corners, under the fan and sweat to death during my lunch! Try to grab a nicer seat if you are planning to visit. Funny - In the store, there was an over dressed waitress wearing a black suit bottom and a sky blue blouses with white ruffles collar. Her look was absolutely absurb in the surrounding environment. Well I guess she was the owner of the restaurant, so she had to be special among them lol.1) Fried Fish Skin $13There was no exception for eating in a HK noodle shop without having a dish of fried fish skin. The fried fish skin came in a small bowl and the portion seemed to be rather small at a price of $13. Nonetheless the fried fish skin was very crispy. It did not have any flavour itself, so present this bowl of soup on the table beside the fried fish skin. The bowl of soup was extremely salty but nice to drink, it should have contained a lot of MSG in it.  After dipping the fried fish skin into the soup for a few seconds, the crispy fried fish skin now became a mixture of crispiness and softness, which was the best essence of the fried fish skin.2) Beef Brisket Flat Rice Noodles $21The portion of the beef brisket flat rice noodles was rather large, so were the beef briskets. The beef briskets were actually beef brisket and tendons. The texture of the beef tendons were made too soft, which lost its usual chewiness. The beef briskets were tasty, they were mostly half fat, but the lean ones were not as tender as those with the fat ones. The flat rice noodles were rather soft but were very smooth. The smoothness should be due to the oil that was added to the soup base. The soup base were full of the taste of beef brisket. It was so tasty which I could not help drinking half of the bowl. Yet after having the bowl, I was in thirst. The soup was rather salty, so I guess they have added in MSG in that too.Door Front0Door FrontThe colourful Menu0The colourful MenuFried Fish Skin.

It seemed like the cha chan teng to eat during my party all night days where a bunch of my friends and I, after a whole night out, we'd stop here to have breakfast before heading home to sleep. And as my party days have long been in my past, so has Tsui Wah.Entering into this one, I notice it's been a while. This shop was now a bit more run down. Almost an ode to yesteryear.Menu is in English and Chinese. There is no 10% service charge and cash only.I ordered a beef and egg macaroni in tomato soup ($56). It came with a drink. When it arrived, my entire bowl was super oily. Even the bottom of the bowl. The tomato broth lacked any sort of tomato flavor and was just super greasy. The egg had a runny yolk that disappeared into my soup and didn't add any extra flavor to it. The beef was so soft but it lacked any beef flavor. They also had a lot of potatoes in it which was odd in my opinion. The pasta itself was overcooked. I ate away sadly. Maybe I should have gone to Tai Hing and ordered their macaroni in tomato soup as it was much better. I won't be back to this one shop anyways.0"", ""Came by for lunch the other day and was able to be seated immediately upon arrival. The booths are a little small and service was prompt and efficient by the staff.Started off with the Soya Sauce chicken wings that were decent. Chicken wings were fresh and the flavoring was good.Moved on to the sweet and sour prawns pan-fried noodles which was also okay.

781,Tsui Wah Restaurant,Wan Chai,Chinese,3.3,50.0,0.0,"Our usual dim sum place was full, so we drove to Wan Chai to see what we could possibly have for lunch. We were planning to go to a kebab place, but it was not opened. I then noticed there was a Tsui Wah right beside the kebab stall. Is it just me or is Tsui Wah popping up everywhere? The outside looked quite classy for a Tsui Wah, and I always love coming to this place for slightly overpriced local food. We entered the restaurant and were ushered upstairs. I must say, the decor was quite impressive, in comparison to the other Tsui Wah Restaurants I have been too. The restaurant chain is really starting to go for a more modern feel, which I appreciate greatly.

The toast was really small, but the eggs were cooked very well. This dish came within two minutes of placing our order, which is what I call speedy service. breakfast set C - vermicelli w/ shredded pork 0breakfast set C - vermicelli w/ shredded pork This dish was served hot. Once again the portion was tiny in comparison to the other Tsui Wah Restaurants. The soup was was only a little bit over-seasoned this time. The shredded pork was very fat. This dish took five minutes to come, which I would still consider very speedy service. crispy bun served with condensed milk0crispy bun served with condensed milkThis is one of Tsui Wah's all time most popular dishes.

The amount was just right. shredded pork & mushroom w/ fried noodles0shredded pork & mushroom w/ fried noodlesI always order this, as it is one of my all time favourite dishes. The dish was steaming, and when I put a bite to my mouth, it was too hot. That is a very good sign. There were more ingredients then usual, which I liked very much. The noodles were fried perfectly and the portion although it appeared smaller, was actually larger than at other Tsui Wah Restaurants. My only complaint was that there was too much sauce, and it was more viscous than usual, I prefer it slightly thicker.  inside of the pineapple bun0inside of the pineapple bunpineapple bun0pineapple bunThis was a huge disappointment. As a classic Tsui Wah dish, I believe the standard of this pineapple bun was appalling to say the least. First, it was not hot. Secondly, the top of the pineapple bun was not crisp at all. With that being said, when I finally proceeded to bite into the bun, it was not warm, or tender, and I felt really disappointed. I think if this branch is to survive, the pineapple bun must be improved to meet the high quality standards set at this restaurants other establishments. Otherwise, the reputation of Tsui Wah in my mind will drop many points. milk tea!0milk tea!Luckily, the milk tea was not a  disappointment. A classic, and a definite must have. What really added value to this simple local drink was the presentation and the choice of cups to serve it in. Hot, yummy, rich, soothing goodness. The overall dining experience was pleasant. It was not crowded at all, probably because it was only 11:00am on a Sunday morning. I am delighted that there is now a Tsui Wah in Wan Chai, as it is less crowded then Causeway Bay and Central. However, the quality at this branch is much lower than the other eateries. Maybe, this place still needs a little bit more time to get into the swing of things, but I'm not sure I will be returning here in the near future. I will, however be paying the Tsui Wah in Causeway Bay a visit to restate my confidence in this restaurants pineapple bun.Supplementary InformationFor first time diners, it may be useful to know that it is customary to bring the bill downstairs to pay. I would also recommend going on a Sunday morning as there will be less people, however if you want an authentic Tsui Wah experience, then you have to go at lunch time on a business working day. It is great that there is now a Tsui Wah in Wan Chai near the bars, a good place to sober up after a good night out at the nearby bars and clubs.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/wan-chai-tsui-wah-restaurant/82579?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

I chose hot and it did not disappoint.The noodles were served with the usual extras, spring onions, menma (bamboo sprouts??), half an egg and chasiu (the meat).Although everything was of good quality, I found there to be too little meat. Normally (at other tsukemen places) you get two full slices, however I only received one, and it looked a bit chewed up rather than clean cut.

The sauce as the menu described, is made with lots of pork bones, chicken bones, seafood and vegetables. It does have a very distinct flavour of bonito fish to it that makes it stand out from the usual tonkotsu base that most ramen shops make.

We both liked the original flavor more than the ""spicy"" one -- the sauciness is tooooo mild.But the noodles is quite decent. Thicker than general ramen, the texture is firm and chewy.  To fit (some?) Hongkongers\' taste, the restaurant serves both ""hot"" and ""cold"" (more specifically, ""chilly"") noodles. Definitely go for the authentic chilly one! The hot one has a softer texture. They serve generous portions. You can decide the portion, small, medium (210g) and large (270g), without extra charge. Medium filled me up and left me no space for post-meal desserts. Their soft-boiled egg and chashu taste so-so. They should really improve the soft-boiled egg!

Boyfriend added $20 for this and soft drink. The deep fried chicken wasn't too good. A bit dry.0I wasn't too keen on the appetizers this time around. I guess a tip is to skip the appetizers. Save your money and just order the ramen. However, would like to note on the service. I wonder if they were that much in a rush to get us out but they removed dishes the minute it looked empty. It got to a point where they even took away my glass of soft drink when there was still some in it and took away my boyfriend's plate where he put some food in it for later eating. I felt that was pretty rushed and rude of them to do so without asking if we were finished before taking it away. For that, this review now gets and ok."", ""I have never wholeheartedly like ramen although I have them for meals once in a while as B loves ramen. It's certainly very hard for me to lick a bowl clean as I often found them too greasily heavy, but not here. I literally finished up the last drop of the dipping sauce with the last strip of noodle.The housemade special thick noodles are so tsuru tsuru and shiko shiko that you can't help slurping. The sauce as the menu described, is made with lots of pork bones, chicken bones, seafood and vegetables. It does have a very distinct flavour of bonito fish to it that makes it stand out from the usual tonkotsu base that most ramen shops make. The impressive thing about their broth is that it doesn't have the kind of greasy heaviness that most ramen soup bases suffer owing to the massive amount of pork bones used.As for the shoyu tamago and chashu were also perfectly done and complement the noodles well.Oishii!!a la carte menu0a la carte menutable setting0table settingSpicy Tsukemen$ 800Spicy Tsukemen$ 80Original tsukemen$ 780Original tsukemen$ 78Stewed pork inside broth0Stewed pork inside brothSpringy housemade thick noodles0Springy housemade thick noodlesLunch menu0Lunch menu"", 'Finally we got to try this new tsukemen restaurant in CWB. We started queuing around 11:45 am on Sunday, 15 mins before the shop was open.The pork bone and fish broth is not strong and thick enough. Errr, a big no for tsukemen broth. And it is a little too salty -- I mean the fish taste is too strong for me. It is not as salty and oily as some reviewers on Openrice criticized. These people don\'t really understand what kind of food they are judging . We both liked the original flavor more than the ""spicy"" one -- the sauciness is tooooo mild.But the noodles is quite decent. Thicker than general ramen, the texture is firm and chewy.  To fit (some?) Hongkongers\' taste, the restaurant serves both ""hot"" and ""cold"" (more specifically, ""chilly"") noodles. Definitely go for the authentic chilly one! The hot one has a softer texture. They serve generous portions. You can decide the portion, small, medium (210g) and large (270g), without extra charge. Medium filled me up and left me no space for post-meal desserts. Their soft-boiled egg and chashu taste so-so. They should really improve the soft-boiled egg! Most ramen shops I have been to in HK serve better runny eggs.Deep-fried chicken which comes with the set was pretty good. Overall, it was just okay. Not impressive at all. Will visit again if I crave tsukemen in CWB (I believe there are better options in other districts!) and there is no long line outside the shop.

783,Tsukiji,Central,Japanese,4.5,100.0,8.0,"On a holiday noon, what better way to spend my lunch other than with my loved ones. As she like Japanese food, i decided to bring her to this restaurant as the reviews are quite good on Openrice. It was located on Central, just a couple minutes walk from Central MTR. They offer quite a wide range of Japanese food, ranging from sushi, sashimi, and meat etc. When we reached slightly after 12pm, the place was already almost full. I guess it was so popular as their menu was quite comprehensive. Banana beef rollThis was also one of the better beef roll i have tasted. Beef was sliced till thin, juicy and tender at the same time. The only thing is that the rice roll was quite huge in portion, and may not be able to fully taste the beef instead. Soft shell crab hand roll Portion was quite huge, as the soft shell crab was overflowed wrapped in a seaweed roll. In order to enhance the taste, i poured some soy sauce in it so that it can be slightly flavourful. It was crispy on the outside and yet the meat was soft. Grilled steak we ordered a main course. Even though the steak was cooked slightly towards well done with not much redness in it, but the meat was still soft and tender. Sauce was poured onto it.Clams with sake Normally when i dine in a chinese resturant, clams was usually cooked in black bean sauce or the chinese way of cooking. When i comes to a Japanese restaurant, i will definitely want to try it being cooked in a different way. I liked the way how the soup taste, as the sake did not overwhelm the whole dish completely. The soup was clear and sweet, with the clams juicy as well. We practically finish drinking the whole soup off.  00'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-tsukiji/14620?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
784,Tsuta,Causeway Bay,Japanese,3.8,131.0,18.0,"Tsuta is pretty much famous. Awarded the first Michelin star for a ramen restaurant in Tokyo in 2016, it has a really REALLY long queue. Or as my coworker once told me, she got a ticket at 7 AM and was told to come back at 5 PM where she waited a further hour for her bowl of ramen when she tried the Tokyo branch. After this bit of fame, they expanded branches to Taiwan and Singapore, they now have their third branch in Hong Kong. Located in Causeway Bay's Tang Lung Street, a street already filled with several other ramen restaurants.When it first opened, there was a long queue. I waited a month later and there was no one in line. I guess hype ended quickly. But summer was way too hot for ramen so I waited until today to go try it out. I was curious. Why did the queue die down so quickly? Why did the hype end when other places (like Ichiran and Lady M) still garner long queues year after they opened? Now, I haven't tried the Tokyo branch due to the fact I really have far too many other places I plan to eat and it was just not on the top of my list. Just to let you know I cannot compare to the original branch.The restaurant was chic in design with a red and black color combination. A bar table faced the chefs at work. When you enter, the staff presents you with the menu. The choices are identical except of the soup. You can choose shoyu or shio. After you tell the staff what you want, you pay right then and there. Cash only or you can use Octopus which they have a machine located on the wall. There is no 10% service charge. A ticket is given to you and you are told to give to the staff who will bring you to your seat. This was weird to me. The original shop (and pretty much EVERY RAMEN RESTAURANT IN JAPAN) have a vending machine where you order your ramen. Here they mimic this vending machine concept but there is no vending machine. Which goes to my next mind boggling thing about Hong Kong ramen restaurants. How come they don't install vending machines? Is it that hard to for Hong Kongers to use that they have to get rid of it? Or they just like to hire people to pretend to be vending machines?After I was shown to my seat (which was super big and had a nice long handle to hang my purse), I waited for them to make my bowl.I ordered the ajitama char siu shoyu soup ramen ($149). I mean, go big or go home, right? It included four slices of char siu, egg, bamboo, leek and truffle paste. Just to let you know, portion size is small. Don't expect to roll out of here with a full stomach. But we're here for the best, right? Quality over quantity, right?0The char siu is sliced when your order is received so it's not presliced and laying there like other restaurants. the char siu was pretty good. Not fat at all but still tender and soft. It was sliced very thin as well and didn't remind me of eating char siu but more like ham. Or pastrami. Interesting.The egg was fantastic. It was lightly seasoned and the yolk. The yolk was beautiful. Runny and creamy. This was really perfection in an egg.1The noodles were good as well. They were springy and firm. Note that they had small brown specks interlaced within the strands. This is due to the use of four different types of flour used to create the noodles.1I ordered the shoyu soup as this is what the original shop's signature dish. Like the original branch, they have a cap on how many bowls they serve a day. 400 is that number here but just to let you know in a city where there are more than 400 people, I have yet to see them close early. Now, soup is what makes or breaks a good bowl of ramen. It's all in the soup. Their shoyu soup is made up of chicken, clams, dried fish and three types of shoyu. They then top it off with a small amount of truffle paste. Now, here is where it slightly failed for me. The soup was clean and light. It wasn't heavy at all and it did go well with the rest of the clean light ingredients before me. But then the truffle paste hits it and everything just disappeared. It was far too strong and suddenly the light balance of everything was gone. All that hit me was this strong pungent odor. In a way, the truffle paste ruined everything and I couldn't get rid of it. It just lingered on and on.This made for a sad ending for me. I was not sure was it worth it? Everything was wonderful until I hit the soup. The soup, the core of everything and anything that is ramen was such a let down. Probably the most expensive ramen in Hong Kong, this seriously upset me as I should come out happy, right? But I wasn't. I was confused. I was not satisfied. I wasn't even full. I couldn't even finish drinking the soup, an insult to the chef, I'm sure. For it was the soup that let me down. I really won't be back but I end my review with an ok as I did like everything else except the soup. And it gives me pause to think, how willing am I to go queue up in Tokyo for this as well?"", 'Japan Ramen Flavors galore with a touch of Truffel and amazing Soba noodles.Can select between strong and weaker flavor, 1 or 4 slices of Charsiu pork. recommend to come during afternoons on a weekday to avoid delays.

786,Tubino,Causeway Bay,Italian,4.0,137.5,0.0,"The restaurant takes up 2 floors in L\'hart, and there\'s an internal staircase with a chandelier that leads up to the 2nd floor. The downstairs is brighter with the big panes of windows letting the light in, and upstairs the blinds are closed behind the bar which means you could almost be fooled for thinking you\'re having dinner instead of lunch. The use of fake brick walls gave it a rustic feel, which was balanced by modern lamps and tableware. They put some thought into the water jugs, not the run-of-the-mill ones you get at Ikea / Pricerite. The Tubino logo was printed on the sugar sachets and coffee cups, and their coffee also bears their brand. I guess it must have had some history considering it was ""since 1932"".Tubino coffee0Tubino coffeeStairs and chandelier0Stairs and chandelierBar0BarA little alcove0A little alcoveThere was an ?Indian/Pakistani manager and another waiter of darker skin colour, and the other 3 I saw were your typical young Chinese dudes with funky dyed hair. It seems they work as 2 separate teams - once I saw the expat waiter bring up a basket of bread in one hand and a pile of dishes on the other (intended for the kitchen), he eyed and gestured the other 3 Chinese staff to help him serve the bread basket, but they were all engrossed in their own conversation and completely ignored him, so he had to put down the dishes and serve the bread himself. Fair enough if it\'s your job, but it\'s team work that makes a restaurant run smoothly.We arrived a bit earlier than our booking, and was seated upstairs. Others started to file in and soon the place was near full but still maintained a quiet and comfortable noise level and ambience. However, everyone else that ordered after us got their bread baskets and appetises before our table! That was quite poorly done, considering I had already asked nicely for the bread (was starving) and they still served the other tables first. The tables were a tad too close to each other, which meant that when the waiters had to walk between two tables to get to the other side, his butt (or his front) would be pushed right against our table. Not a very appetising thought. If only there were 3 instead of 4 tables along the middle of the room, that would have been much better. I hope the restaurant could take this into consideration of their customers\' comfort despite a dent in their profits. The toilet was very technologically advanced, you pressed a button the right and it opens the door, and you hit the Lock button on the inside to maintain your privacy, and the sign outside turns from a green ""available"" to a red ""occupied"". A novel approach, but I just hope these mechanical things don\'t break down as often as they do in real life. Would be unpleasant to be stuck inside and have to find a technician/fireman to come rescue you.The set lunches were very reasonably priced with a good range of options for main courses. Set lunch menu0Set lunch menuThe minestrone was tasty and had quite a lot of nicely chopped vegetables, the salad was fresh but uninspiring, though they managed to get the mix of olive oil vs. balsamic vinegrette right. Minestrone0MinestroneSalad0SaladWe ordered the chicken and the pork for mains, and added a salmon spaghetti (they changed it from fettucine for us to my mum\'s request) to share.

The chicken was juicy but the cajun spices didn\'t come through for me. The pork was a much better option, it was of a very good quality and you can taste the freshness from each bite, and there was just enough fat to keep it moist and tender. The salmon spaghetti in tomato sauce was a well executed dish, the pasta al dente and there was just the right amount of sauce to keep it all together. The salmon was pan fried and cooked through but still retained its firmness and juice.Salmon spaghetti0Salmon spaghettiThere was a complimentary dessert of 2 cheesecakes and a blueberry mousse cake, just enough for 2 to share.Free dessert not bad0Free dessert not bad The rose tea was a fragrant infusion of rose buds and sweetened gently, with a girly pinkish hue that shimmered through the glass tea pot. The coffee was aromatic and thick enough, with a thin cap of cream on the top.A look around the other tables revealed prettily a tiramisu in a glass bowl decorated with 2 kinds of biscotti with a berry selection at the side, a long mille feuille with a light sweep of cream inbetween the layers to hold all the fruit together, and other colourfully made cocktails and drinks. All in all, the food was of an above-class quality for the price, and although the waiters were a bit slow initially, they made up for it by being more attentive in the end. (However, they forgot to lay out a knife for my mum until I got up to ask for one). The waiter gave us another 10% off which he promised to give us again if we see him next time. Gimmicky, but it works on me. Dinner\'s a ""fine dining experience"", or so the waiter claims, and for ~$300 a dinner set, that\'s a bargain. Corkage fee is $200 a bottle.', 'Overall it was a good experience; the seats are comfortable and the place is cozy with pleasant music.  The service was personal.

I can taste the syrup so I assume it's not the fresh kind of coconut juice but it's still good.The big plate of pad thai came shortly after (when I only get to drink a few sip of the soup). The waitress also gave me a condiments tray for my pad thai which I think is nice service! There they have sugar/salt, dried chili, the salty fish sauce, and some type of vinegar which I tried to mix with the pad thai (except for the sugar/salt) and I found the vinegar the best condiment to go with to my surprise! The pad thai has an artificial orange color to it, a bit more ketchup / tomato paste than other restaurants, but the flavours go well together.

Since we were a pair of two, it was much easier to pick and to try out a variety.0To begin with, the appetizers (so-called ""Antipanti"" in Italian) were Toast with Tomato and Meat Sauce (left) and Parma ham with melon (right), two of the most typical appetizers one could find in an Italian restaurant. The toast was freshly baked and sauce topped was still warm when served. Parma ham was cut in excessively thin slice, but the sweetness of the melons got the dish back on track. 0Soup (Zuppe) of the day was Carrot Soup. Not that I liked the layer of olive oil on top, I must admit that a light but fresh carrot could be tasted. Good that the portion was not too big for ladies.00Next we had the first round of the main dish (Primi) - Spaghetti with spicy Tuna in Tomato Sauce (top) and Risotto with Spinach and Parma Ham (bottom). Frankly, I was rather disappointed upon serving. The spaghetti was well cooked, yet it failed tremendously on the tuna paste which felt as though it was just scooped out from the tin, and had it chucked on the top of the pasta. The apperance was not as pleasant as the photo it seemed. The risotoo was quite the same - fabulous taste of spinach blended with the risotto, but very few parma hams and the quite poor-looking dish. Kind of reminded me the school food days, sorry to put it this way.00The second round of main dish (secondi) included the Chicken stew with Eggplant (bottom) and Sole Fillet with Green Herbal Sauce (top). At this point, I subconsciously started to reject the dishes as I was overwhelmed with the bizzarely-looking main dishes. Both the chicken stew and fillet were good in terms of cooking. However, they were completely not presentable upon serving, especially the excessive olive oil which nearly filled the whole plate and the collapsed eggplants which were trying to hold the chicken stew stabled. All but failed to captivate my appetite.0Last but not least, the dessert (Dolce). The Spurmone ""Italian Ice cream"" was perhaps the anti-climax of the 5-course lunch, bringing me back with a slight satisfaction before I paid the biill. Velvety Chocolate Mousse cake was too sweet for sweet-tooth like me.As far as I am awared of, serving good Italian dishes requires not only the fine taste but also the ability to impress the guests the moment upon serving. The food in Uno Duo Trio were great, all finely cooked and tasty. But the impression I had for nearly every dish was not what I expected, given the flavours were good. Some dishes even went to the extent of halting my appetite in the middle of the course. When it comes to Italian dining, impression is just very important in words that can\'t be explained.', '2 days ago I cross through Yiu wa street and I notice that there is an Italian restaurant that I haven\'t tried yet- Uno Duo Trio. I was quite hungry so I decided to give it a try. When I enter the restaurant I notice that it was quite full, so I thought to myself that bad it can\'t be. the restaurant has several options for lunch, and I choose the option that include antipasti, soup and pasta for 148$ the antipasti that I choose was tomato and rocket salad, the vegetables were very fresh and salad was tasty, not dry and not to wet from the sauce, in total I was a good choice for appetizer. the daily soup was cauliflower creamy soup; the portion wasn\'t too big so I had left some space for the pasta. the soup had a great texture, thick enough and you can feel that it made from a fresh cauliflower. the antipasti and the soup were served with bread that the waiter told me that its homemade bread and it defiantly taste like homemade bread. the pasta that I order was a kind of pasta that called ""small ears"", I ask the waiters what does this name means, and she told me that the shape of the pasta is like small ears. of course I was had to order it and see what it means...  so I order it and it doesn\'t really looks like small ears but the taste was amazing, very simple sauce of rocket, olive oil and sausage, but the ingredients were in a very good quality and the pasta was al-Dante like in Italy, so everything together create a great dish. even though I didn\'t plan to eat in Uno Duo Trio from the beginning, I was so pleased with the food so I decided to order dessert. the lunch menu has some desserts but I wanted to try their Tiramisu, so I ordered from the dinner menu. the tiramisu was the defiantly the best tiramisu that I ate in Hong Kong. it wasn\'t too sweet, but not bitter from coffee, it had the right texture and it also served with a round caramel and nuts cookie that was really good as well.I really enjoyed my lunch, and I will go there next time for dinner.Great! small ears pasta0Great! small ears pastaGreat! tiramisu0Great! tiramisu', ""Dropped in to try out this place based on well-regarded reviews. Lunch menus are typically shorter but concise, and one would expect better value. The chef is highly skilled and what's been stated on the lunch menu was smartly presented.

The question is, if it was fine dining / haute cuisine, where the chef shows off his or her skills, and charges the meal for quite a bit of money, one would expect a little more than the average dining venue:- White table clothes would be ideal, bare wooden tables with mats works too, but paper liners- Service: feels like an afterthought, rather than a key element in building a relationship with customers (paying for this kind of money). For someone not familiar with finer Italian food, some explaining would be great.- Setting & Ambience: Basic, but it's the pop music that is very confusing. I don't expect Italian operas, but something relaxing (Italian or not) is adequate. - Food: Baking your own bread sounded promising, but only once a day and not available at lunchtime The disappointment is compounded by the fact that the starter (1 soup, 1 blood orange & fish cold platter) took 20 mins to arrive, and without olives / biscuits / little snacks, we were quite literally playing with our fingers... The main courses took 10 more minutes after taking away our empty starter plates. Whilst the risotto and lemon chicken were delivered, it was unfulfilling.

795,Under Bridge Spicy Crab,Wan Chai,Chinese,3.7,48.0,0.0,"Everyone knows this place. It's famous for serving spicy crab. Tourists flock to this place. But did you know this place serves lunches that only cost $48?If you want the $48 lunch deals, let them know. Otherwise, they send you off to a nicer section of the restaurant where you will be surrounded by tourists eating crab in the afternoon.0Once boyfriend and I requested the lunch sets, the waitress moved us to another area of the restaurant. Yes, mainly the door where there is lack of air conditioning. The menu is then in a one page laminated paper. It's also all in Chinese. There is no English. Yes, not for the tourists. Basically, for $48, you get a bowl of rice and a Cantonese main such as sweet and sour pork, a soft drink or Chinese soup of the day. There is no 10% service charge and no tea charge. They only add $5 if you want coffee or ice lemon tea. That, people, is cheap.lunch menu0lunch menuSoup of the Day. Yeah, this was soup of the day. It came exactly like this. Hmm...service seemed a bit different once you weren't ordering crab. Anyways, I don't know what kind of soup it was but it tasted and looked like curry beef brisket. There was chunks of beef brisket and sweet carrots. It was thick and yes ... I kind of needed a bowl of rice right about then. It wasn't bad. It was just very very strange.0Sweet and Sour Pork. This was pretty good. It was not too sweet and not too tart. Right balance of flavor. The pork was not overly coated with flour like so many places now a days. Pork was also moist. What was amazing was the pineapple used was not canned but fresh pineapple chunks. Why do I think this? Some of the chunks still had the tough centers in them and ther were not removed properly yet.0Chicken with Scallions and Chilli. A very simple dish that I like. Chicken was moist and tender and not undercooked. The scallions and chilli gave the chicken a rich fragrant taste. All was drizzled with a bit of soy sauce. Simple yet perfect.0Aside from the messy beginning, the food was actually good in a very tradtional sense. The food was back to the basics. Nothing fancy. Just good, honest meals.

It was quite spicy but the linguine was cooked al dente. I'd have preferred it less hot. The seabass wasn't very fresh I think - And the skin was slimy - which I don't like. Fish with skin should be seared on both sides until the skin becomes super crisp; another technique Jamie Oliver taught was to de-skin the fish (without completely detaching the fish from the thin layer that holds it together), that way you could sear both sides of the skin and there would be NO SLIMY SKIN at all. Slimy skin on steamed fish is fine. They ought not have sauteed it - please get rid of slimy skin!! >< Chargrilled salmon steak with herbs n' mayo sauce chargrilled salmon0chargrilled salmonDisappointing. I might not have realized that it was salmon had I not been informed beforehand...in other words, bad. Perhaps it wasn't properly seasoned..? Not enough salt? Should salmon steak be seasoned or marinated? Yes if you want it to taste special, like this supertasty miso-marinated fatty salmon G made a month ago - but that aside, salmon doesn't need a lot of treatment to be yummy right?  something must've gone wrong with the steak itself then. It wasn't very dry so I don't think they overcooked it. The bed of greens accompanying the steak was just as oily, sour and salty as the starter. and it consisted of roughly the same ingredients.  Not sincere. Chargrilled sirloin steaksirloin steak0sirloin steakAgain, not a fan of huge slabs of meat...so I didn't try this one. But according to D it's one of the best steaks he's had!

Parma ham was a bit too salty for my taste but I'd call this a pizza I enjoyed. The waiter recommended that we roll up each slice from the outer rim and eat it like roll so that with each bite, we get a bit of everything - salty, chewy stringy cheese, plus the extra crunch of the crisp crust. yummy! The dough is freshly made each day. I'd recommend this restaurant's pizzas.

Thanks to the group-buying promotions, I recently got the incentive to break my prejudice and try a few places around these areas. I purchased this 3-course buffet lunch offer, $215 nett for 2 ppl. Thinking that my mother would like to have some quality food, I invited her to go with me. Im a buffet freak, so I looked forward to this day.Finally came the Day. W52 occupies the G/F & 1/F of a narrow building capturing an alleyway as its outdoor terrace area.  Its chic outlook and design blends well with the location. Contemporary bar on ground and a cozy restaurant on the upper level. Indoor space is not large, but still allows six tables to comfortably spaced on one side, and maybe a few more tables on the other side. Elevator is in the middle. Antipasti table, with a large variety of appetizers like fresh greens, Parma ham with melon and fresh fig, smoked salmon, cheese platter, zucchini mousse, pasta salad, Russell sprouts, tuna Carpaccio ..., is set right at the entrance. Next to this table at the corner is the dessert table neatly displaying more than 10 types of 5-star dessert, from tarts, mixed fruits, 3 types of cakes, bread & butter pudding, mango custard filled crepe, puff, tiramisu, panna cotta, to crme brle. We received friendly service from the waiters. The manager was there at the beginning to oversee the operation of the lunch session. Our lunch set also includes 1 main course, selected from 3 items. My mother and I both chose the fettuccini with capers, anchovy, tomato and olive. There were actually three other items on the menu that we could choose at an extra cost + 10% charge. After taking the order, a lovely bread basket with 4 kinds of fresh and warm bread was set on our table, including a special squid-ink roll, crispy Italian breadstick, baguette, and spongy focaccia. I asked the waiter for olive oil & balsamic vinegar  perfect partners for focaccia. I was delighted that he gave me a red label - balsamic vinegar that has been aged for at least 12 yrs. I also asked for Tabasco, black pepper and parmesan, the waiters brought them up to me with great efficiency and always WITH A SMILE!  That's what you call quality service. No complaint at all about the quality of the food on the buffet table. Having a taste of each dish can already make a lady full.The fettuccini was nicely done, though it could be more al dente. Also, the kitchen may need better quality control cos my mothers dish was quite dry without olive and capers, while mine was well mixed with sauce and ingredients. To my own surprise, I finished up the dish! W52 might not be the best restaurant that Ive visited, but it scores high on everything  from service, food, presentation to hygiene. A little complaint I might have is that my fork was not properly cleaned, but the waiter apologized twice to me and promptly changed it for me upon my request. Oh, here is a bonus - every customer got a souvenir - a cute pack of toothpicks made with natural Japanese wood  no bleach, no chemical. A final note to the restaurant:  the table of young female Caucasians were laughing and talking out loud and disrupting other customers, well, me and my mother to be exact. If the restaurant manager or captain could do something to deal with this kind of situational problem and keep the dining place pleasant, that would be an extra credit to W52.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-w52/37558?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw
810,WIRED CAFE,Causeway Bay,Japanese,2.8,140.0,2.0,"Wired Cafe is currently doing a crossover event with Funassyi, an unofficial mascot for the city of Funabashi, Chiba, Japan. He (she? it?) is basically a pear who likes to dance to heavy metal music and yes, he can talk. You have to look up some videos of this guy dancing. It's insane and I couldn't stop laughing.Anyways .... this is what Funassyi looks like. For the event, Wired placed the figure outside their restaurant. That is pretty much the only Funassyi decoration they have.0For the event, they have a special menu. If you order anything off this menu, they will give you a Funassyi button.0They also have souveniers such as mugs and tote bags for sale.0This is the button I received when I ordered off the menu. I thought it was a bit stingy as last time I came for the Kumamon event, they gave me two buttons as I ordered two things off the menu. I did the same this time, ordering two things off the menu, and I only got one pin. They also didn't let me choose the button, unlike last time. I guess they changed the policy this time? Or maybe last time the waiter just didn't care.0Funassyi Pear Juice ($58).I ordered the pear juice. After all, it is a pear! This came served in a glass with the pear designed all over it. The drink was pretty good. You really can't screw up canned pear juice.0Funassyi Hamburgers ($98).From the menu, they sure looked cute. When they arrived, the faces looked a bit ... squashed. Trust me, this is the nicest way I could photograph them. In reality, they looked like something out of a horror movie. But that wasn't the end of it. The burgers were horrible to the point of unedible. The two mini burgers were different. One was a hamburger, the other chicken burger. The patties tasted like the strange artificial meat patties I bought one time from the 759 Store frozen section that were from Korea. They tasted rubbery and strange. The bun was hard as a rock. Seriously. HARD.AS.A.ROCK. And the fries? They were crunchy like potato chips. It appeared they fried them and refried them again prior to serving to reheat them.0I don't understand. The Kumamon event, the food looked ok. It wasn't perfect but at least it looked ok. The food also wasn't good, but at least it was edible. This time, the food was not fit for eating. It also looked like the pear was screaming in pain. Which is pretty much how I was feeling. The juice was great though. Like I said, you can't screw up pouring something out of a can. I highly doubt they freshly squeezed it themselves as it tasted exactly like the canned pear juice from Japan that I buy every so often. Even their PR company faiils as well for when I posted how sad my meal was on Instagram, they were the first to like it. Did they like it because they, too, know it was bad and thus approved? Or they just blindly like everything posted about their restaurant?Will not even bother to try the rest of the menu. I suggest you can pretty much skip this event. Even if you are a fan of this pear, skip it. Don't bother."", ""Waiter walked off when I hadn't finished ordering. I had to follow up to get the coke I ordered that came after the food ($38!). Waiter didn't ask how I wanted my burger done. The coffee float had too much ice. The menu didn't make clear the ingredients in the burger. The burger itself was not tasty at all. Bacon wasn't crispy - more like ham. They don't give you enough ketchup And also it was just a boring, stodgy burger. Give you only a small cup of tepid water and no-one refills. Loud annoying music playing.

812,Wagyu Vanne,Causeway Bay,Japanese,3.8,375.0,0.0,"After trying out Sensou for lunch a while back, I decided to give Wagyu Vanne a try.Wagyu Vanne shares the same restaurant space as Sensou and J Pot under this one big entrance called Goosango. While Sensou is focused on Western fare, J Pot is for hot pot, Wagyu Vanne is for meat grilling. As it's in the middle of the restaurant, there are no windows, thus more darker in lighting. Each table has a grilling station. When you enter, you are also greeted by a fridge showcasing all their beef.Lunch time they have lunch menu. Menu is in English, Japanese and Chinese. If you choose to grill, you can choose the tasting menu. If not, they offer sets that include a salad, soup, main and dessert. As I didn't feel like grilling, I ordered a lunch set.0It came with a salad. The menu said pan fried scallops with fresh garden salad. Um...I saw no scallops. I found no scallops. When asked, they said they ran out of scallops and had replaced it with parma ham. To me, I think they should have informed me some time before I ordered that the scallops were going to be replaced with something else. There was no apology for this as well. The salad was ok. Nothing to really rave about.0The soup was a crab miso soup. This was ok. Nothing exceptional about it. There was a lot of fresh crab meat throughout.0But this was the main event. I chose the Hiyami F1 Wagyu Steak with Japanese Rice and Teriyaki Sauce ($228). It came with a some pickles and a small appetizer dish of soy sauce marinated zucchini with corn. The appetizer was warn and not too salty.0The teriyaki sauce came in a small pitcher that poured over in one thick texture glaze. It was sweet and it flavored the steak nicely. The steak was cooked to a nice medium rare and was soft and tender. Portion was not large but it was enough for me.0Dessert was beautiful and I think was probably the best of my entire meal. It was a yuzu sorbet with fresh strawberries and blueberries. There was some biscuit crumbles and shards of crystallized honey. All on top of a monaka wafer. Not only was it beautifully presented, but the textures and flavors were on point.0Overall, the food tasted nice though some were a bit average for the price you pay for. The dessert was the star. Service was good except for the part of informing me about the scallop replacement. They do have a lot of people working at this restaurant. Considering the number of actual diners, there was far too many of them and they did cluster around chatting. Though they did notice immediately when service was needed. Like Sensou, the food was fine. But would I be back? Unsure."", ""Recently opened ( May 2019) and had a craving for quality yakiniku. On a gloomy  Sunday, we decided to try something different from the ordinary.  With so many options, it's worth a try for something new and not overrated (yet). Entrance was a bit difficult to locate..as you the entrance is called Gosango..just before the main entrance to 535 Tower on Jaffe Rd. Hostess was super friendly and that's a plus, especially in Hong Kong. We decided for the dinner set A menu over the lunch set menu A. No a la carte at lunch - which is good to keep things simple. The staff will cook the meal at the table for you and explain each dish. Good value for money!!

This was my first visit to the shop and after its been relocated in Wanchai.The shop can sit around 30 people with a patio for a dozen of diners when weather permits. Better to visit in small groups.Unlike those ramen specialists in town that only offer a narrow choice of ramen (just with variations in the intensity of soup base/seasoning or noodles cooking time, etc.), one like me may have difficulty to choose among wagyu beef, pork or the traditional char-siu (sliced pork) from the menu in Wakayama because I would like to try many of them.a) Wakayama Ramen ($105)  8/10Wakayama Ramen - Soup base is great0Wakayama Ramen - Soup base is greatIn my first visit, I picked the signature Wakayama ramen to sample. With a clear broth, the soya sauce like soup didnt impress me when it arrived. The large bowl contrasted with a single, small slice of char-siu, half egg and a fistful of noodle gave a feeling of a small portion served. However, on a sip of the broth, my taste buds were awaken by the intense flavour of the bonito () used for making the soup base. The ramen was slightly thicker than the ones commonly found, cooked to al dante. The char-siu and egg were not much to mentioned. The pencil-like Thai asparagus was with tough stems that beyond chewable.b) Deep Fried Chicken Gristle  ($48)  8.5/10Deep Fried Chicken Gristle - Good to go with beer0Deep Fried Chicken Gristle - Good to go with beerThis dish was beyond my expectation. In the dish I could find chicken thigh and fillet which gave different textures, especially some with skin to give a crispiness.

A few pieces of wonton can also be found and they have very thin skin packed with a mixed of veggies and meat. While the soup base is very clear and delicious. A lighter kinda soup to enjoy with families.00Chicken noodlesWe have also ordered a simple plain chicken noodles. The noodles are very smooth with a good chew to it. Also, the broth has a good chicken meat flavour and you can definitely drink them as it is not too savoury.0Iberico pork tan tan noodlesIt has become my favourite kinda noodle from the restaurant because it can kill 2 birds with 1 stone. I like Iberico and I like tan tan noodle. The slight spicy nutty flavour from the tan tan noodles is very tasty when complimenting with the crispy fatty pork cutlets covered in a thin batter.0The fried seaweed on the side can also be eaten too if you are obsessed with seaweed like me.0Siu Long BaoWang Jia Sha's siu long bao is very famous. With no disappointment, the dumpling has a very thin and elastic skin, while the filling is super juicy with some minced pork. This Shanghainese delicacy is always one of our favourites and Wang Jia Sha does a pretty good job.000It's good that they have now opened a branch in cwb Soundwill plaza, it's so accessible and I can see myself coming here again because the environment and seatings are also very comfortable and spacious."", ""Wang Jia Sha is a fairly popular chain of restaurants serving Shanghai dishes in a modern setting. Popular among families as they are always situated in a shopping mall, I think I've been to quite a number of them as they are always a safe choice to go with family and definitely not something I would think to go with friends.Recently, Wang Jia Sha has opened in Causeway Bay's Midtown with a whole new name. The English name is Wang Jia Sha but the Chinese name literally means Wang Jia Sha In the Mood For Love. Hmm...ok? Curious, a couple of us decided to go there for a late lunch, thus a bit on the quiet side.The restaurant shares the same floor as Greyhound and you can actually use the same entrance for both restaurants. It appeared they shared the same bar.0Bar? Yes, bar. This Wang Jia Sha has a bar. The restaurant, itself, is very different in design than the other Wang Jia Sha. There was an open kitchen. It had a color scheme of black and red. There was even a dragon that looked like street graffiti. All this made it look like I had walked into a club in Lan Kwai Fong.0As there was bar, they had a drinks menu with alcohol and cocktails. Things I had never expected to find in Wang Jia Sha.0The menu still featured Shanghai dishes. Menu is in Chinese and English and in the form of a piece of paper to check off what you want.Pearl of the Orient ($42). Out of curiosity about the whole bar concept, I decided order a mocktail. This was strawberry and lychee with lemon juice. I also noticed they added red dates which made for one very sweet drink. There was lot of ice so I wonder if it was supposed to be slushie?0Fried Long Dumpling and Shrimp ($42). Served with Worcestershire sauce for dipping, this was really good. The wrapping was thin. The filling was just enough. The shrimp meat was mixed with carrots and other vegetables for a bit of crunchy texture.0Deep Fried Dumplings, Mixed Meat and Mushrooms in Pear Shape ($38). These were super cute and they did look like pears. The dough was sweet and the mixture of meat and mushroom was gave it a savory balance.0Xiao Long Bao ($48). They had two different xiao long bao. Regular and one with crab meat. But I just wanted regular. Though filled with soup and the skin was perfectly thin without falling apart, I found this way too salty. I had never had such salty xiao long bao before. All I tasted was a mouthful of salt. This was the least liked item I ordered.0Tan Tan Noodles with Iberico Pork Chops ($98). An upgrade from the usual pork chop and tan tan noodles as they used Iberico pork. The pork chops were excellent. Tender and moist. The coating was not too thick yet extremely crispy.0The noodles were al dente. The soup base was not spicy and had a rich peanut taste that I like.0A younger, hipper design with most stylish plating of the food in hopes of drawing in a younger customer base. Prices not too expensive and food was fairly decent.

816,Warren Restaurant,Causeway Bay,Chinese,3.7,100.0,0.0,"To me, I really prefer having Chinese food during CNY period. After a very fun night spending time playing MJ with friends, we have stopped by this local HK style restaurant for a feast for the king.We have started with a bowl of daily soup which is ""Winter Melon with Pork Tender Soup"" . It\'s hot and not too salty. I also like that there is no / very little MSG because I can clearly feel it on my tongue that there is no tingling feeling. The pork tender is super soft and it\'s quite surprising that each bowl of soup comes with a big piece of meat!00Deep fried potato cake and chicken wingsThen we have a deep fried snack platter. The potato cake is pretty surprising because it\'s decently creamy and crispy on the outside. Although they are probably frozen but they do choose good ones. The wings are crispy and nicely seasoned also.104 Treasure RiceIt\'s been a while! Salted duck egg and red sausages are the staples of 4 Treasure Rice. For the other 2 Treasure, we got ""assigned"" randomly with roasted BBQ pork and roasted duck meat. The amount of rice is very generous and it is sprinkled with some light soya sauce.1I am not a big fan of red sausages and I have only tried the other meat. The duck meat is lean with almost half and half fatty skin and meat ratio, it\'s always nice to enjoy it with some of those sweet plum sauce on the side. The sweet and savoury taste complimented nicely with the strong flavour from the duck. I wish I can get more meat out of it though! 1The BBQ pork (char siu) has a mix of lean and semi-fatty type. The smokey taste is strong and it is nicer once it gets warmed up by the rice. I particularly liked the fattier ones because the lean ones can be a bit chewy.Overall, it\'s still a very hearty plate of true Hong Kong comfort food here. The salted duck egg really lifted the flavour of the BBQ meat.1Lava French ToastFrench toast is definitely one of the best kind of Cha Chaan Tan style food to treat yourself. Rather than the classic peanut better french toast with syrup, the restaurant makes it a lava version with a super doper runny custardy centre. The deep fried toast is covered in egg and stuffed with a lot of runny rich egg yolk like.1Once cutting into it, the filling just oozes out immediately. The filling is similar to those ones in lava custard buns which is absolutely delicious. It\'s sweet but not too sweet. It\'s rich but you can easily share this among 2 people. I still like the old style but I think this modern twist has bring this traditional snack into the next level!1Lastly, we also ordered a dessert which is a grind walnut almond sweet soup. It\'s quite sweet when compared to the french toast. It\'s somewhere between thick and runny and it has a very subtle nutty flavour.0Milk with eggI have heard of this drink for a long time and I think this might be my first trial. It\'s basically hot milk with a raw egg breaking into it. Then you will need to stir that raw egg into the milk, making it a light yellowish drink. It\'s amazingly enjoyable with a creamier texture. The taste is a bit like steamed egg with a stronger milky aroma. Give it a go if you can handle half cooked egg or if you like drinking milk.0Coke with salted lime and lemonThis is probably a drink for everyone because it\'s just coke with both salted lime and lemon at the same time. It\'s sweet and savoury, so it is delicious as you can imagine. A great drink to ease our appetite after a very comfort food to our heart.0It\'s a very classic HK style cha chaan tan but with some twists here and there. There are some very traditional food items like milky egg and BBQ roast meat, but there are also some innovative items like lava custardy crispy French toast. The seat is spacious and clean so give yourself some relaxing time feeding yourself with some very authentic HK style food.'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-warren-restaurant/506637?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

Wasabi Warrior was on the same street as , the Chinese herbal tea shop. I got there at around 12:20pm, before the lunch crowd. The servers there walked me through their choices  they had sushi rolls to nigiri, to sashimi, and even hot Japanese rice bowls (teriyaki chicken or eel). As it was very hot that day, I opted for one sushi roll and three nigiri.As recommended by my friend, I had the Cooked Tuna and Avocado sushi roll ($19). I ordered the spicy version but they gave me the one without the seven-spice. It was still enjoyable, probably better than the spicy version. The tuna was dressed sufficiently with mayo, on top of it there was a slice (or two) of ripe mushy avocado, making the roll creamy and airy. Glad they gave me the non-spicy version as it felt refreshing and clean (in line with my original intent).Cooked tuna and avocado roll - Creamy fillings!$ 190Cooked tuna and avocado roll - Creamy fillings!$ 19I picked two types of nigiri out of the seven they offered that day: regular salmon, regular tuna, regular scallops, seared scallops, seared salmon with avocado, inari sushi with crab sticks and inari with seaweed. (1 for $12, 3 for $32, 6 for $52)Seared nigiri - Sushi rice packed too tightly$ 320Seared nigiri - Sushi rice packed too tightly$ 32Both seared nigiri were lightly charred with lines of mayo drizzled on top. I had two seared scallops nigiri, which was coated with a sweet sauce which tasted like teriyaki sauce, a bit foreign but it tasted good. The scallops were soft to the bite, which was a big contrast tothe rice below. The rice was packed way too tightly, one had to work the rice in the mouth for a bit before it disintegrate. Same goes for the seared salmon nigiri, salmon and avocado were always a good match, upped by the sweet sauce. But the rice was simply too packed. Maybe it was how the Aussies liked it (??).I didnt have the inari sushi but I had to mention them because OMG the inari sushi were gigantic! They were at least three inches long! They werent stingy with the crab stick/seaweed for the inaris either. I think it will be an excellenttummy filler.My lunch came to be $51 for four items, which was reasonable considering its location in Central (comparing to some upscale supermarkets where six pieces of salmon nirigi cost over $100). I usually eat much more than my fellow Hong Kong girl friends, but I felt full after my lunch at Wasabi Warrior, thanks to the bulk of sushi rice.'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-wasabi-warriors/432590?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

I don\'t just love the food, I also like it\'s forever bustling atmosphere.  Also if you like to bump into the rich and famous, West Villa is definitely the place to be.  I can pick out movie stars, singers, TV stars and famous politicians 9 out of 10 times I dine in this restaurant.  This time a famous celebrity sat right next to my table.Back to the food!  The variety of dim sums that you can order in this place is amazing and they also constantly bring out new dishes.  Rather than the usual Prawn Dumplings and their famous BBQ Pork, I ordered the mix chinese sausage buns.  The bun absorbed all the taste of the sausage and it is so delicious.  Another dish that I would like to recommend is the rice with beef and tomatoes.  You probably thought I was crazy ordering ""HK Cafe Style"" dish in a proper Chinese Restaurant.  I can assure you that this is the best rice dish with beef and tomatoes you would have ordered!  The rice was lightly fried with eggs.  The beef was tendered and full of flavor.  The reason why I like this dish so much I think was the source.  The source was full of tomatoes and also button mushroom bits.  Simply delicious!Still my favorite restaurant!

821,Westwood Carvery,Central,American,4.0,265.8,2.0,"I reserved a table for 2 a week ago for lunch and went their 1/f restaurant for dinning today. Usually I went to 1/f for dining instead of the ground floor as ground floor is always packed with diners. However, today when I went to 1/f, the bartender told me that the shortage of manpower, they did not open 1st floor for diners. So I have to go back to the ground floor. Luckily, today is not full. I was wondered why the restaurant is not full as usual. I noticed the servers and duty in charge person changed, I hope there's no change of my beloved uni pasta. When dish comes, the outlook is as same as before, taste like before .....however I cannot tell whats going wrong....seems the dish is not so delicious as before? Hm....in past time, I visited there at least 1 time a week...recently I tried the other restaurants and almost forgot this , haha....but today, I revisited again, it did not bring me any surprisingly good....not surprisingly bad....just I have no intention to visit again......0"", 'I am totally excited to announce that my Uni past is back to Westwood again!!!!!!! wow!

My friend and I were super disappointed but still stayed for lunch.  The waiter was really sorry about our disappointment and suggested for us to try their signature sandwich, which we did. To both of our surprise, it was very good. We highly recommend it. Their lunch sets include a soup or salad, a main dish (beef dip sandwich in my case, comes with freshly made fries and an apple), and a drink. We got a regular lemonade and a pink lemonade. The quality and taste of food was good here, including service. I would definitely come back to this restaurant despite the original disappointment of discontinuing sea urchin pasta. Signature beef dip sandwich - Tasty0Signature beef dip sandwich - Tasty', 'I came here on Tuesday for lunch with my family.  We ordered the pasta of the day which was sea urchin carbonara lunch set and 2 x prime rib sandwich sets. The sets came with drinks which we ordered the freshly squeezed lemonade plain, green and red colours. Note the plain one is really plain, order the green (cucumber) or red (raspberry) colour is better. We chose 2 x soup of the day which was cream of cauliflower and beef and barley as the entrees for our sets. The service was good, the soups were mediocre, nothing outstanding but the same standard as you expect from a normal Chinese western style restaurant but at a lower price. The prime rib sandwich wasnt as good as it use to be, the bread wasnt crispy nor did it have enough butter and was cold, not sure if it was toasted. The prime rib was warm and very tender, juicy with a great beef taste, Id prefer more of the slices were medium rare instead of mixed. The fries were good and well seasoned, but the portion seems to have got smaller.  However the pasta was really smooth and creamy flavour which was probably the highlight.  Took the apples home as we were full but they werent crispy! Some more attention to quality control is required, but Id still go back!

Their slow cook prime beef sandwich (au jus) was pretty good too. Love the horse radish spread on the Ciabatta bread. Gives a good kick...however I do I wished there were more beef inside coz I dun feel full at all eating that @ $148. One of my fave was their Crab Cake appetizer @ $188 (!!!) it was a big portion and you can really taste quality meat in there but wished they could have more tar tar sauce considering the crab cake is pretty big. Their Michael Mondavi wine cost $570 which I think is quite over priced but it was better than ordering their wine per glass which cost $108 - $118.Overall a good dining experience but too costly for causal afternoon lunch.', 'Westwood Carvery is famous for its standing rib roast, but what about its other dishes? We came here today for lunch. Their prime rib  la carte order has its price increased by roughly two-fold since my last visit a few years ago ($450ish), too expensive for me to have for lunch. My friend took a half portion of the prime rib sandwich lunch set ($128 for a half portion and $168 for a full portion) and I had a grilled cod with vegetables lunch set ($178).The lunch set comes with a drink (either lemonade or coffee) and a choice of soup or salad. I had the salad. It was a very small portion with a mayo-based salad dressing drizzled over the top. The salad was alright.Both of our main dishes came in less than 5 minutes. My grilled cod came first, but the sandwich followed in a minute or so.The prime rib was well-roasted, fine-textured and very tender, not falling short of our expectations of a primal cut. And pinky roast beef is best friends with horseradish sauce and onion. Add to that some hot, crispy fries and you have the perfect meal that will leave you in food coma for the remainder of your afternoon at the office (which was okay considering that we got news during the first half of our meal that Typhoon no.8 was expected to be hoisted shortly).My grilled cod was a very different dish. The cod seemed to have been deep-fried, because not only was it overly crispy on the outside, but oil was dripping down as I cut through the fish at every point. Too much oil and not enough flavor beyond saltiness, unfortunately. The cod also came with a slice of grilled pineapple, half a red pepper and a few spoonfuls of diced onions and potatoes. Oil had been showered over the veggies. Somehow, though, fat satiates, and not in a bad way, because natural fats improve our mood and with food satisfaction happening much sooner, we eat less overall. If the fish was steamed, I might instead have gone for a cake after the meal, which would have made me feel even worse afterwards.The hot coffee (Americano) was slightly on the sour side, but it was freshly brewed and helped my digestion a little bit.Looking around, almost everyone had the half-portion sandwich. Most people ate with their hands, dipping the sandwich into the runny brown sauce and licking their fingers clean at each turn, evidently too absorbed to care about table etiquette. The dining area is extremely small, with a seating capacity of roughly 15-20 indoors, so expect this to be very casual and a bit noisy. Service was decent for a busy lunch hour.Final bill came down to around $340 with a 10% charge.Half portion prime rib sandwich (Lunch set)0Half portion prime rib sandwich (Lunch set)Grilled cod (Lunch set)0Grilled cod (Lunch set)', 'When I first started working in Central last year, lunch time was actually one of the most intimidating hours because finding affordable and comfortable places in the area was actually a challenge and I never thought I would be able to make it through. Now, having exceeded the maximum number of months in one place, it\'s hard to believe it\'s been over a year working here, and it\'s even harder to believe there are so many reasonably-priced and delicious restaurants in our pedigree! Little did we know that there\'s a real hidden gem serving prime rib sandwiches in a Central alley. When T told us that he hasn\'t been there before, we were like ""STFU!"", and we decided to go there for our happy-almost-end-of-the-week-lunch/Chinese New Year lunch gathering last month.0Located inside Wo On Lane, Westwood Carvery is a small and casual place with only 4 to 5 tables, so early booking is a must. The place is an easy one to miss and you may casually disregard its existence at first glance. Service was friendly and polite. Having reserved a table at 1:15 p.m., Yves, being her charming and punctual self, successfully got us seats at 1 p.m. and wonderfully prepared some cute red envelopes for us!0Westwood Carvery offers several lunch sets ranging from $128 to $200 which are served with either a salad or a soup, and a drink. The famous Prime Rib ""Dip"" Sandwich set was what we came here for. For that, they offer two sizes: the regular size ($128) and the large size ($168). Since it\'s not officially the end of the week yet, and you know, we wanted to stay fit and healthy, we opted for the regular size one.0(1) Believe it or not, T chose the Green Salad to start with which was surprising considering he\'s the athlete among us. However, it was certainly a decent and light salad to set your stomach for how much meat you are about to gulp down your throat. The salad dressing tasted fine and distinctive.Green Salad1Green Salad(2) Yves and C ordered the Cream of Spinach Soup which was quite pleasantly presented. The soup was naturally flavourful and creamy, and the tiny bits of bacon further elevated the taste of the soup. It was just nice to have something warm (and green) during these cold, cold days.Cream of Spinach Soup0Cream of Spinach Soup(3) The long-awaited Prime Rib ""Dip"" Sandwich finally arrived with freshly made creamy horseradish on a ciabatta bread and beautifully came with French fries and an Apple. It was definitely worth the hype! The taste of prime rib, the sauce and the bread interacted with one another magnificently, forming some of the most delightful and attractive tastes in our mouths. The beef was tender, moist and after dipping into the flavourful gravy sauce, the meat instantly melt on our tongues, due to being gleefully and perfectly cooked! The fries were sheer deliciousness and the apple was also a refreshing and healthy complement to such a heaty, meaty dish!

827,Wing Wah Noodle Shop,Wan Chai,Chinese,3.3,50.3,0.0," (English name: Wing Wah Noodles Shop) has been here for 68 years. A small noodle shop, it seems like all the other noodle shops throughout Hong Kong except for one thing. They are one of the few shops that still make their wonton noodles by the age old tradition of using a long bamboo pole to make the noodles. It's hard work, sitting on a pole while you bounce up and down to make egg noodles found in bowl of wonton. Years ago, many shops made their noodles this way. But the younger generation wasn't interested in picking it up and noodles were produced in a big factory as it is faster and produce larger amounts. And so this tradition is dying away.Wing Wah will be one of them. The owner is too old to go on. The younger generation doesn't want to pick up the reigns. And so, after 68 years, it will close at the end of August. Recommended by Michelin, it was not that guide book that brought me here. It was the first foodie I ever encountered, my father, who took me here. As he explained the process and to seriously appreciate this small bowl of noodles. To him, this wasn't just a bowl of noodles to fill the stomach and move on. To him, this was a bowl of sublime perfection for its simplicity and deliciousness. After that day, I returned. Usually on his birthday and just have a bowl. That has been seven years. After hearing it was closing, I went one more time for a bowl.I guess many other heard it was closing. The usually quiet shop was super busy. Each table was full and when I left, a small queue had formed. Many people around me were first timers. A few asked what did they serve. Many were taking photos.Located in Wanchai, right across from Southern Playground, the restaurant is small and very old fashioned looking.0Menu is in English and Chinese. There is no 10% service charge. They are your typical wonton noodle shop, serving wonton noodles. braised beef brisket and even pork knuckle (which is really good as well).0They make their own pickled radishes. These are always very sour but super crunchy.0I ordered a bowl of wonton noodles ($44). My usual order. You get a total of 5 wontons in this small bowl.0The noodles are clearly the star. A lot more hard than other places, the noodles are darker in color as well. It's super al dente with no starchy after taste.0The wonton skin is thin with a brownish tinge. I assume from the flour they use. They use the traditional way of half pork and half piece of shrimp per dumpling. Different than other places that have changed it up by giving you more shrimp and less pork. The filling was savory sweet. The shrimp was fresh and firm.0The soup is also delicious. Using a traditional method of pork bone, dried flounder and shrimp shells, the soup is bang with flavor. The broth is clear and not heavy. Fragrant and not oily. You can tell it was cooked for hours to produce this amount of flavor.0It is still one of the best wonton noodles in town. It may look simple, but so much work was done to create this. One can only appreciate and thank them for creating something so wonderful. Something that I was lucky enough to try and savor. Sad it is closing. Sad that another craft will be lost to modern technology. And so ... goodbye Wing Wah. Good bye to the past."", ""After spending both money and time in Central, Mum and I hopped on the tram to Wanchai to hunt for good food. Our target this time was Wing Wah Noodle House at Hennessy Road in Wanchai. Wonton noodles appeared to be a staple here. The noodles are made using a special technique inherited from the forefathers. The dough is being pressed by a bamboo pole repeatedly to produce a springy texture. This technique requires a man to hop up and down on the bamboo pole which sounds to be quite a tough job to many noodle makers.We had one of the usual soup versions which is more commonly known as 'Sai Yoong' by the Hongkies.  It is served in the traditional way where noodles are placed on top of a glass spoon with a few wonton dumplings at the bottom.  We also tried the dry version with the shrimp roe on top, also known as Har Ji Meen in Cantonese. The noodles appeared to be thinner than our Malaysian wonton noodles, with a strong presence of alkaline water. It possesses a springy texture and it goes very well with the soup base made of 'Tai Tei Yu'. This fish is burned over a charcoal fire till crispy and fragrant before being added into the soup. The fragrance of the fish is infused into the soup and this gives a natural sweetness to the soup.Mum likes the noodles so much and she just can't stop thinking of it until now. Wing Wah Noodle House is a restaurant which deserves a revisit.0Springy Noodles served with Robust Soup0Springy Noodles served with Robust SoupFresh Shrimp Roe0Fresh Shrimp Roe"", ""Wonton noodles is one of my favourite foods and so every now and then, I will go and look for a good bowl. The only good noodle place near my office is Wing Wah in Wanchai and so that is where I went today.Sadly, Wing Wah is very inconsistent and today's noodles were too soft, broken into bits and the wontons were all wrong. They were overcooked and some of them broken up. One wonton only had a big piece of uncut pork inside and the shrimp had swam out into the soup.  I also ordered a plate of boiled vegetables. Usually boiled vegetables at noodle shops are a bit too much for one person but the portion at Wing Wah has only about 6 vegetables, so only enough for one person and at $30, that is expensive for a noodle shop. Today, the vegetables were Kai Lan and very crunchy and green, the beef flank sauce I asked for instead of oyster sauce goes better with it. So at least that was a consolation. The other thing that you must have if you go there is the pickle turnip in a jar on the table. It is pickled in vinegar with a bit of chili and while waiting for the food which is often quite slow, it's nice to have some. In terms of wonton noodle shops, I much prefer Ho Hung Kee or Mak's as they are more consistent. After a bad bowl at Wing Wah, it will take me a long time to want to come back again. Sadly, this isn't the first time I have had a bad bowl of noodles here although I have had good ones too.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/wan-chai-wing-wah-noodle-shop/4024?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

829,Wing's Catering,Wan Chai,Chinese,3.5,50.0,2.0,"My boyfriend and I were around the area to take care of some errands.  He insisted to take me to this restaurant and was sure that I would love it.At first, I was skeptical about it, but ended up he was right.  I enjoyed the rice plate and think I would eat it again if I am near by the area.Since there are so many restaurants to try in HK, I have became a little more critical and selective on the restaurant\'s choices.I would look at their environment, space, service and of course food quality.First, Comfort is one of the things I notice when I sat down.  I must say any small eat (   ) places in HK have too limited of space.  The minute we sat down, I feel like I want to get out of the restaurant asap.  I guess that\'s the goal for all small restaurant owners in HK.  They want the most turn over for their limited tables.  As soon as I sat down, I felt really cramp and my back was literally touching the person\'s back behind me.   I look around the restaurant, even though it\'s small, they keep it very clean.Second let\'s talk about the service.  Their service appears to be very efficient.  I got my chicken rice out in about 3 minutes.  However, I think they forgot about my boyfriend\'s order, so we had to remind them.  By the time I almost got done eating, he just got his plate.  Thank goodness he usually eats really fast like a vacuum cleaner.    It only took him about 5 minutes to clean up his plate and we finished both our plates about the same time.Lastly, but most important part of the review is the food quality.  Is it worth it to go back even with the discomfort and the absent minded services  I said to myself... "" YES"".  The chicken dish was tender and flavorful.  I ordered the chicken with pork neck meat and it was delicious.  It came out hot and juicy.  The sauce is a bit sweet like teriyaki sauce with just enough pepper to give it a kick.  Chicken was so easy to break up with just the chopsticks.  With a little bit of chopped gingers and onion on the side, brings out the flavor of the rice and the chicken when eat them together.Despite the small cramp seats and the hick-up of the minor delay on the service, HKD 50 to buy you a quick and good lunch in Wan Chai is very reasonable.  Can\'t expect HKD 50 to have luxury seats and first class service, since food quality was good, I would go back and buy lunch box and bring back to office in the future. 0'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/wan-chai-wings-catering/31154?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

The Sriracha Mayo was very tasty and it was slightly spicy which made it very appetising. I would say there could have been more Avocado though. That said, it was a pretty good wrap and the portion was reasonably big.A drink was included in the set which could be soft drink, iced lemon tea with $10 top up for hot drink at your choice. I ordered coke zero which had nothing special to talk about.Two of my friends ordered their wings. They smelt pretty good when served to us but it was really a bit worrying that it might not be filling enough just having 10 wings. Really had to say that it was super inconvenient to eat the wings with forks. It would have been much better if they could provide gloves for eating the wings. I noticed some other eaters got gloves, maybe on request again?At the end of our meal, a discount of 15% was offered to us as a token of their apology for their late service today. Had to say that the service of the female (seemingly only) server while that of another guy was not so friendly because he always wore a black face.Not a bad place to come back but I think I would still go for the wrap rather than the wings."", 'So this is the Wingman and I would expect they should do it way better than any bar.... right?The seating was pleasant, and service was great.We ordered the lunch menu that came with the cream of mushroom that tastes and thin like water.Wings, yes they do have many varieties, but most of them are not as saucy as I would expected. Dry.... most of the wings are dry and small.Fries and fried lotus were not bad.Verdict: Maybe my preference is the juicy big fried wings with or without sauce. I probably will not come again cause any bar can serve wings.'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-wingman/626030?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
831,Wolfgang's Steakhouse Hong Kong,Central,American,2.5,444.0,0.0,"Sorry but it didn't live up to expectations and also the reputation it has in other countries. Food was not impressive - got a New York Sirloin and a Dry-Aged Beef Sandwich. The steak had no seasoning and the baguette used for the sandwich was rock hard. Couldn't chew it or rip it off. We took out the stuffing and left the bread.Service - the staff were just chit chatting amongst themselves and singing along to all the songs in the background. There was only 1 other table at the time and they sat on the opposite side. Made the restaurant seem more empty than it needed to be. Not up to par with the Wolfgang image.The Dessert of the Day was Creme Brle, unfortunately the consistency was too thick and gloopy, and the caramelised top was too hard - making the shards difficult to chew.For the price we paid, we could have easily gone to a Michelin Star restaurant.But the french fries were good, my highlight of the meal."", '2017 has been a pretty slow year for restaurant openings so far but things are about to look up with a number of interesting names slated to open in the next few weeks. Leading that list isWolfgang\'s Steakhouse byWolfgang Zwiener, an import from New York City that specializes in dry aged steaks and quality seafood.0I was looking for a place for my Father\'s Day celebration so this is just a very convenient choice for me. With 14 locations worldwide including Japan, Korea and Singapore (opening soon), Wolfgang\'s Steakhouse has earned their reputation as one of the top-tier American steakhouses and I\'m looking forward to a great time here celebrating my first Father\'s Day with my little nugget.0Caesar salad($125) - Before our steak arrived, some salad to keep our cholesterol level down. This is what a textbook Caesar should look like with freshly chopped lettuce which is nice and crisp. The crispy crouton was perfectly crunchy and the shaved parmesan was the ultimate icing on the cake.Caesar salad$ 1250Caesar salad$ 125Wolfgang\'s crab cake($158) - Could this be two in a roll? You bet it was. The crispy crust of the crab cake really provided a pleasing contrast to the delectable lumps of crab meat in the middle. Unlike some places where they put mashed potato into the mix to minimize their cost, this is just fresh crab meat all the way. Very very nice.Wolfgang\'s crab cake$ 1580Wolfgang\'s crab cake$ 158USDA Prime Rib-eye steak($880) - Finally, today\'s main event - our 700g rib-eye steak which has been dry-aged for an approximately 28 days like the rest of the steak here.USDA Prime Rib-eye steak$ 8800USDA Prime Rib-eye steak$ 880This came with a very flavorful crust. The texture was just perfect. It was tender, juicy and the flavors were developed very nicely after the dry-aging. I thought it was a little pricey but without question, very tasty and addictive.0I got the chance to check out their ""old-fashioned"" steak sauce too. This tasted a little like typical barbecue sauce but more on the sweet side. Not my cup of tea. Having my steak with its own jus is just fine with me.0I didn\'t get to try their other signature dishes like their Wolfgang\'s salad and grilled green asparagus (I did nail down their signature crab cake). I guess I\'ll have to find another excuse to come back for those in the near future.'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-wolfgangs-steakhouse-hong-kong/528192?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
832,Wong Chi Kei,Causeway Bay,Chinese,3.9,110.0,0.0,"Wonton noodles are a classic Cantonese dish. It may be simple, but it's far from it. There's a lot of work that goes into making this simple dish. Everything from the noodles to soup. A lot of work is put into it. Stepping into the Hong Kong wonton noodle where there are already big names like Mak Siu Noodles and Chee Kei among others, is Wong Chi Kei. Originally from Macau, they are a third generation family business. And now, they have expanded into Hong Kong.As I live near Causeway Bay, I decided to try them out for lunch one day. They are located on the second floor so you need to go up a flight of stairs. Menu is in Chinese but English is available upon request. There is a 10% service charge. Seating is spacious and fairly comfortable. There really wasn't a need to share a table with strangers.Wonton Noodles ($38). The bowl of noodles came with four wontons. The soup was a clear broth that had a strong taste of dried shrimp and fish. There was sprinkle of crunchy garlic chives.wonton noodles0wonton noodlesThe wontons had a thin wrapping. The amount of shrimp with pork was a nice combination. Not too much shrimp to overpower the pork but enough to enhance the sweetness of the shrimp.0The noodles were smooth and thin. Biting into them, they were al dente. I read that the noodles were still prepared the old fashioned way: bouncing on top of the noodles with a bamboo stick. A method that is rare or pretty much nonexistent in Hong Kong. There is a theory that if the noodles are made this way, they will be even bouncier in texture than ones made by a machine.0Fried Dough Wrapped in Rice Sheet ($28). As it was lunch, one bowl of noodles was not enough because it wasn't a big bowl. I added a snack. This was pretty good. The fried dough was still crispy. The rice sheet was thin and slick. Usually they put the peanut sauce and sweet hoisin sauce on small plates on the side, but this was not the case here. They squiggled it on like a decorated cake.0Fairly decent bowl of wonton. No need to wait in line like the other more popular Chee Kei that is in the same area so that's a plus if you don't want to wait. I noticed they have afternoon tea sessions that include a drink. Would be back if I needed a wonton fix."", '0With over a half century\'s history, the restaurant was reknown for its housemade noodles using bamboo sticks.0Beef Brisket with dried flat noodles ($55)0Although it was called ""beef brisket"", the noodle was served with a mixed of beef tender and beef bisket covered in rich and intense beef stock.0The noodle was cut and cooked evenly. The lye taste was still prominent despite the flavourful beef stock. The way the noodle was prepared made it very absorbing. The noodle got mixed in the thick collagen rich juice easily.0The beef tender was soft and jelly-like. It literally in my mouth once I mashed it with my tongue.0While the beef brisket gave a more solid texture with a tougher chewiness. The easily tore meat fibre should be suitable for elderly.0If you wanted to add some complexity to the dish, feel free to add some of their housemade chili oil for extra spiciness and flavour.Chili Oil0Chili OilThe chili oil was not very spicy but it really gave an extra kick to this heavy and savoury noodle dish.Chili Oil0Chili OilIf you wish to stay away from the chili oil, don\'t worry, a complimentary bowl of shrimp roe clear soup was also provided with your dry flat noodle.0The small amount of shrimp roe sinking at the bottom was already flavourful enough for this hot bowl of clear soup. It was such a nice match with the dry noodle.0I have been craving for a good plate of beef brisket flat noodles for months and Wong Chi Kei has got everything I wanted! The flavour of the beef brisket, the texture of the noodle, the taste of the chili oil and clear soup. They all reminded of the old Hong Kong authentic taste of simpleness.Pickled Ginger Preserved Duck Egg with Soft Yolk($38)0There were six pieces of preserved duck egg with a runny sexy soft egg yolk. The eggs were served with pickled ginger as well as some scallion.0Having them all together in one bite would be the only way to enjoy this traditional small dish. The freshness from the scallion and sourness from the pickled ginger balanced out the thick and strong preserved flavour from the duck eggs. The crunchiness from the sliced ginger also made a great contrast to the soft eggs. It was a dish that I could eat again and again!Pickled Ginger Preserved Duck Egg with Soft Yolk($38)...$ 381Pickled Ginger Preserved Duck Egg with Soft Yolk($38)...$ 38Steamed noodle rolls stuffed with deep fried dough ($28)0This traditional dish was my childhood\'s favourite pick at any congee shops.

It was a refreshing drink with a noticeable smooth red tea base and fresh orange juice.Housemade Iced Tea ($32)$ 320Housemade Iced Tea ($32)$ 32The menu has a lot of other typical Hong Kong dishes.

833,Woo Tung Yakiniku Dining Bar,Wan Chai,Japanese,3.5,115.0,0.0,"This restaurant located in a little slope in between Admiralty and Wanchai. My friend recommended me toorder the Lunch BBQ set whichincluded miso soup, salad, pork, chicken and vegetable for BBQ, and a bowl of rice. The soup tasted a little bit strange to me as it had some kind of alcohol flavor. The salad was not spectacular but at least was fresh. The waiter wouldcook the meat and vegetable in front of you. Once the food was cooked, the waiter would put it on the dish. Both the pork and chicken sliced perfectly which was neither too thick nor thin, and it was still tender after the grilled. There were 2 choice of sauce that you could dip the meat to it. I thought one was fruity flavor and the other was just the standard sauce. Overall, I thought the food was okay, but the service was good and the best part was no oily or BBQ smell was found on my cloths afterward.Miso soup0Miso soupSalad0SaladBBQ0BBQBBQ0BBQ0', ""One of our colleagues made a booking for this poplar restaurant. The restaurant is situated on a slope inside an old Chinese style building. We had to walk three levelstake off our shoes and walk into a tatami room.

The set also came with a salad and a bowl of miso soup. The miso soup was with tofu and some onions. A bowl of rice and a small dessert, apple vinegar sherbet . Two coal stoves were provided to nine of us; which I have to say was not quite sufficient. Not enough space for everyone.Having said that, the chicken was really tender. The pork was fine but a bit thin. Make sure you use their specially prepared yakiniku sauce. . It's excellent with everything.   I didn't try the beef (I changed it to pork). But my colleagues seemed happy with it.Friendly service despite demanding customers.Although a bit pricy in view of the relatively small portion of the set (compared to Iroha), I realize part of the price was for the decor.

834,Wu Kong Shanghai Restaurant,Causeway Bay,Chinese,3.5,160.0,10.0,"Today is everyone's birthday in the Chinese calendar. Happy Birthday !!We chose one of our favourite restaurants for lunch. Wu Kong in TST is an old favourite for those of us who live on HK side as it is an easy location to find. This chain of restaurants do not use MSG in the dishes. The HK restaurant moved from their Times Square location a few months ago to Lee Theatre Plaza. And this is our first visit to their new home. 0The place looks more packed in terms of proximity of tables and there seem to be many more tables. The plus point is one side of the restaurant is glass windows with a good view of Causeway Bay below, so the place was bright.We ordered most of our old favourite dishes: Smoked fish. They manage to keep the fish soft and there is no taste of soil that you find with this dish in other restaurants. This is my Dad's favourite dish Ham blocks. My husband's always orders this dish. Here they are in delicate chunks and there is no thick layer of jelly or fat. The meat was quite finely chopped and the flavouring is well balanced0 Wor Tips (Pot Stickers)  and Fried buns. The wor tips went so quickly I didn't get a photot. There was juice inside the dumpling which is rare and very welcomed. I prefer the skin to be more brown and crispy though. The buns I found to be too soft. I like them with more bite and texture, the flour they used may be a bit too refined0 Fish head and glass noodles in casserole. I am not keen on fish head but I had some glass noodles, mushrooms and pork. The sauce was tasty and instead of just serving the head, there was a big chunk of the rest of the fish too0 I forget the name of the duck dish but it is deep fried boneless duck pieces eaten with steamed pancakes, cucumber, leeks and hoisin sauce, just as you would with Peking Duck. I love this dish. It makes me think of a KFC wrap00 Chinese cabbage in pot soup had many different ingredients inside: river shrimps, bamboo shoot, cabbage, ham, egg dumplings, mushrooms. The soup was bland, so we had to ask for some salt. After adding salt, it was just right0 Although we did not finish the dishes, we couldn't resist ordering Toffee Bananas. When they arrived, they looked wonderful. However, the inside had a big layer of soggy dough and the bananas were not ripe. So a huge disappointment. I had to separate the crispy toffee from the floury dough and just eat the toffee. Very messy0All in all, the restaurant almost kept up its usual standard. We had to wait 10 minutes for a table even though I had booked and we arrived on time. We were shown to a smaller table than we wanted. But no doubt these are teething problems which would all be sorted out in time.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-wu-kong-shanghai-restaurant/79212?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

The restuarant was not crowded and we got a table almost immediately. It's a large restuarant and probably about 10 tables were taken. The noise levels were quite low for a chinese restuarant. The staff are very friendly and some of them speak some English.We were looking at the ala-carte menu to order and they said it's better to order from the lunch menu where the same dishes are cheaper.

The average price of the dim sums was very reasonable, ranging from $15 to $26 for most of the items, and they claimed all the dim sums were cook-to-order. If given a choice, dinner is more attractive than lunch. a) The Classic 3 - Signature Shrimp Dumpling  ($26), Shrimp and Pork Siu-mai  ($21) and Chinese BBQ Pork Bun  ($15)  7.5/100Judging from these 3 typical dim-sum can almost conclude the overall food quality of a Chinese restaurant. Unlike the modern version of shrimp dumpling and wanton in which large shrimps dominate the whole dumpling, the piece I had was of the right mouthful size. However, it got an overstated name which as the shrimp was not very fresh and the dumpling wrap was not in semi-translucent form.

The roasted goose was decent with the lower quarter and tasty, the skin was a bit crispy. f) Hand Chopped Cucumber ($28)  7/100This should be an easy and yet pleasing appetizer, however, the use of black vinegar was a way too diluted and a pinch of sugar was missing to balance the sourness.g) Short Ribs and Rice with Black Bean in Clay Pot ($32)0The waiter kindly reminded us an approximately 20 minutes waiting time was required and this set a high expectation on it.

841,Xuan Sushi,Central,Japanese,4.3,350.0,0.0,"We accidentally pump into this Japanese restaurant locates in Central after not able to get a seat for several restaurants earlier during the lunch time.  After a quick check on the openrice, we decided to give it a try as we are a bit tired already.  By the way, Xuan Sushi is a recommended restuarant by Michelin guide for several years.Locates on the third floor and with moden but yet contemporary setting.  With a bar table and around 10 plus tables, it is quite comfortable indeed.  Weekend lunch has 10 choices includes omaisaki sushi, sashimi, seafood rice , sukiyaki beef set, etc.  Me and honey after debate for a bit and we both decided to go for the deluxe seafood rice  (#3 on the menu) per their recommendation as waitress explains there are around 10 plus seafood assorted all together included ""Uni"".  Just too good to be true right?Boy, this seafood rice  is amazing!  Presentation is wonderfull and you can instantly sense the seafood is extremely fresh.  The orange colors uni, the salmon roe, toro, scallop, etc.  It just look amazing.  After mixing the soy with wasabi, I immediately tried out the horse mackerel, and it is so good and fresh.  With the perfect vinegar blend rice and body temperature serving, it has instantly become my flavor  ever!  Also, the rice includes a mixed of seaweed and pickel ginger that simulate our taste bud and texture.  The toro is also amazing, and it is almost the best toro I have ever had ... of course it is a bit exaggerated by me.  Haha.  The next up is the Amaebi (sweet shrimp), and it is flat out amazing.  Normally, Amaebi from any ordinary sushi restaurant will be a bit too soft but this one is really fresh!  Almost you can sense a bit of chewy texture, and it is absolutely delicious.  Uni is sweet and matches very well along with the salmon roe.  OMG.... We are pleasantly impressed!Lunch set of course comes with typical meso soup and steam egg.  Both the soup and steam egg is loaded with ingredients and flavour.  Very vood, but they are simply overshadowed by the amazing rice.You can have the choice of coffee/tea or ice cream.  HKD 330 plus service charge for ""seafood rice lunch set"" is a bit on the high side pricewise.  However, the quality is absolutely worth it.  We will definitely come back in the furture to try out their other offering.

842,Y Shanghai,Admiralty,Chinese,4.1,346.7,0.0,"It's surprisingly that I haven't been here before. First experience for lunch and will definitely be back again to try the rest of the menu. Ive ordered the fried noodle with assorted seafood, vegi dumpling, friend Eel and Vegi sweet & sour soup. The noodles were fabulous! Perfect combination of crispy base and sauce with the seafood. Yummy"", 'Had lunch there due to the location although read the bad comments on openrice.We were being assigned in a booth seat, but I think the table setting is quite interesting, the seasonings are put in a shelf on the wall which like in a local restaurant.  Its good, not too noisy during lunch peak hours.All the foods we ordered were very fine, especially the soups (hot and sweet).  The portion of the noodles was little bit small I thought but abalones were not bad, sauce was good.Service is very average, I would expect it could be better in related to their prices relatively.000000', 'Good Shanghainese restaurant in Admiralty.Decent quality food at reasonably price.Natural light and comfortable seats but a bit busy.  >>>Second stop of my in-laws from Japan (first stop was "" House of Jasmine""). This time I chose something closer to work for a quick lunch with the in-laws.First we ordered Smoked Egg: apparently one of the signature dishes of Ye Shanghai. It\'s Shanghainese smoked eggs with a little bit of cavier placed on top. The eggs were very aromatic! Everyone liked it. I was in two minds whether to take photo of the eggs (again, I was quite focused on listening to my in-laws and responding with my very limited Japanese as well as providing translation services to my Hong Kong family members....*phew*.) before I know it, those were gone. Anyway, as always, the smoked eggs at Ye Shanghai were good, slightly fluid at the centre with a strong smoked taste of tea leaves.Ma Lan Tou: Nice small plate of chopped up vegetables named "" Indian Kalimeris Herb"" (found it on the internet, I hope it means something to you because it doesn\'t mean anything to me ). I\'ve only tried this at Shanghainese restaurants and not in other Chinese restaurant.  It is very delicate type of food (read ""small"") which I believe Japanese people are quite fond of. Indeed everyone liked it. Basically its chopped into very small shreds, steamed and tasted like it was mixed with some peanuts. You take a spoonful of it and pick those up with your chopsticks. The texture is a bit similar to slightly dried spinach. My description might be a bit weird but it\'s extremely flavourful. It had a very nice and fresh vegetable fragrance. Try it and you might like it.  : 0: Ma Po Tofu: I couldn\'t resist ordering something spicy. Again, everyone really liked this. Quite spicy but definitely not overwhelming. I believe most could handle this. The spicy level is perhaps similar to 1/2 - 1 teaspoon of chopped chilli. Enough to give you a hint of spiciness but nothing to worry about (if you usually eat spicy food).The great thing about it was that it had a bit of the tingling sensation from the spices (including aniseed), which is what most people are looking for if they are having Sichuan cuisines. The tofu was very smooth, almost as smooth as Japanese style mapo tofu (which placed a lot of focus on the softness of the tofu above everything else.) Recommended. : ! 0: ! Lion\'s head: My in-laws were pretty freaked out when I suggested ordering this. They were freaked out by the name (bearing in mind where there were, i.e. HKSAR, is not impossible that we actually consume lion\'s head - nothing is impossible in Chinese cuisine. ) Anyway, I ordered it for fun. It\'s basically simmered pork meatballs with vegetables and Chinese mushroom in a thick gravy. The meatballs were the size of a fist so probably that\'s how the artistic name came from. I\'ve tried Lion\'s head in other Shanghainese restaurants but I can\'t differentiate between very good Lion\'s head and mediocre Lion\'s head (yet). Anyway, this seemed not bad. All the ingredients were reasonably fresh, the meatballs had a good balance between lean meat and fatty meat, about 7:3. Even the in-laws liked it. """": 0"""": Fried string beans with bamboo shoots: I always order this whenever I\'m here. It\'s hard to go wrong and quite popular with most people: """": 0"""": As always, it\'s very flavourful.  The string beans and the bamboo shoots were coated with a bit of salt with flour sauce. The string beans were very fresh and crisp. I\'m a big fan of bamboo shoots. I think the bamboo shoots here were soaked properly but not soggy; also very crisp.Just a gentle reminder, since Shanghainese cuisine generally use a lot of salt and vinegar. The taste is slightly on the strong side. It\'s made with Chinese wine, soy sauce, salt and pepper. The taste might be a bit heavy for some. Xiao Lung Bao: This is always a sure fire hit with Japanese family and friends:(No photo available: It\'s gone before I manage to pull my camera out! ) I\'d say not as good as those provided by Xiao Lung Bao specialists like ""Ding Tai Fung "", ""Wong Ka Sa "" and possibly ""Crystal Jade ""; however, the quality was decent enough. Every Xiao Lung Bao had a lot of flavorful meat juice inside. The skin was not too thick and the pork had decent pork taste. Be careful when you lift the Xiao Lung Bao, it\'s easy to break.All in all, not bad and we ordered another portion. (This reminds me to go to ""Ding Tai Fung"" or ""Wong Ka Sa"" on their next visit. )Kung Po chicken: Another tourist\'s favorite, whether from Japan or elsewhere.  : 0: According to some recipe books (which I\'ve relied on when I was cooking abroad), it\'s normal to add Chinese wine when flash frying the chicken with red and green peppers before adding at least a teaspoonful of chopped red chili. Luckily, they did not tone down the spiciness too much and there was still a hint of chili aftertaste.The chicken cubes were very tender. Fried with cashew nuts and chopped red and green pepper. Quite good but a little  bit oily.Stir fried Scampi with tea leaves:This is also something which I\'d usually order and the quality here tends to be fairly consistent. Fortunately, this was another hit with everyone one the table. The river shrimps / river prawns / scampi (how you call it depends on where you\'re from) were flash fried with ""Lung Jeng "" tea leaves. The taste of ""Lung Jeng"" tea leave are somewhat more ""licorice"" in taste than the bold ""Pu Er "" tea leaves. I believe Lung Jeng Tea Leaves is classified as a green tea  as opposed to the fermented Pu Er (check the HK tea museum for the details, it\'s very interesting). : 0:  Anyway, the scampi should be marinated in a bit of salt water before flash fried and were quite fresh. I\'d suggest the restaurant put the river prawns in a small pot or a dish similar to those for the Ma Lan Tau. It would make it a lot easier to fish the scampis out.Another gentle reminder: Remember to add a few drops of Shanghainese Black Vinegar before you eat the scampi! It adds a lot of complexity to it. The Shanghainese Black Vinegar taste very much like balsamic vinegar.Recommended.  A great thing about ""Ye Shanghai"" is that almost every dish had the option of ""topping it up"" to cater for the number of persons you have. In my experience, the restaurant is quite honest and fair when going about it. They certainly won\'t rip you off.  We did everything in usual portion other than the Scampi and Kung Pao Chicken because we weren\'t too hungry and the last thing we wanted was to waste food.""Salted pork and vegetable fried rice""Nevertheless, Chinese and Japanese need carbs - i.e. rice, where in the form of fried rice, sushi, congee or onigiri (rice balls). There may not be room for desserts but there is always room for some carbs. So after having another look at the menu, which contained quite a large number of options, we ordered this:: OK0: OK The literal translation, if I remember correctly, was  ""Salted pork and vegetable fried rice"". It may not sound like a very interesting dish judging from the name. But this in fact one of the highlighted dishes. The rice had possibly been cooked in a clay pot and had the crispy rice at the bottom. So we had a bit of that in each bowl of rice divided for us by the polite staff. The salted pork was similar to thick cut ham, not exactly cured like the Chinese ham (Gum Waa For Tui) but it taste similar.   The rice was not too soggy. The texture was not bad. It\'s more similar to a clay pot rice than fried rice. The vegetables gives the otherwise dry rice some moisture.  Service and Environment:Good service, nice, polite and patient plus willing to divide up the rice. But the place is usually pretty busy during lunchtime so not easy to flag down staff. Tables were spaced widely apart and the chairs were comfortable. But the ceiling wasn\'t high enough and could get a bit noisy at times.  Natural lighting: Large windows which allows natural light to enter, which relaxes diners in spite of the noise. Certainly a very nice lunch location in Admiralty.Nice jasmine tea . Not just something to wash down your food with. It\'s worth drinking it slowly. It\'s very aromatic.Price: I find the price very reasonable price for the location and the quality of the food. HK$1,500 for 6 persons including service charge and a few beers(that\'s right, bottled Tsing Tao beers during lunchtime for my father in law - that\'s another common language. )  I remember that they had song performances of the good old days in Shanghai. So possibly a good dinner option as well.Recommended. :: """""""":  (Chef Jacky )! : ! : """"!  : """"  : """" (),, () : : OK: OK () Fine Dining ! ~: Supplementary InformationParis is also known as ""Paris of the East"" in the past.

843,Yachiyo Ramen,Central,Japanese,3.3,135.0,0.0,"Hot hot outside with such a perfect sunny weather right after the typhoon in Hong Kong, I was out for weekend lunch with my roommate in Central. Yachiyo, is just downstairs; to all the people living in Central, it is such a convenient neighbor-dining spot. It is a up-floor restaurant in Soho Square, with a limited L-shape dining space which serves even half of it to the open kitchen. Weekend lunch time is quite empty. The menu is not complex, just Ramen (Ramen, Tsukemen, and Japanese cold noodle), Fries, BBQs, Salads, and some Sashimi. As a normal dining place for an easy and light lunch in a decent price in Central, it is a good choice.The free Japanese starter is always a delicious dish. The salted seaweed is quite tasty and the dish tastes very similar to instant noodle. Well, to me, I prefer sour and sweet starter, like something similar to marinated ginger slice 44My friend loves fresh Sashimi Salad very much, but I think the appearance is not attractive enough and the salmon tastes over-soft. Salad is not bad, especially the slightly sour sauce, which caters this season very well. My choice is Ramen, and a mixed of cold and warm style (Tsukemen Ramen - Japanese dipping Ramen) with a good presentation. The soup is a mixture of Miso and Tonkotsu (pork bone), but not warm enough and a little too salty. To be tough, Ramen is not elastic enough while as it turns cold it is really strong in texture. The pork is just too rough. I love the spring egg (Onsen Tomago) very much, because they use Japanese sweet soy sauce to make it.2Deep Fried Oyster, needs time to be prepared by chef, but it turns out really good, especially the fried flour skin. I don't think the fried oil is some kind of superior brand or imported stuff, while I appreciate the skill of chef, who makes the flour skin fluffy and crispy in mouth, and even performs better than oyster itself.Overall, it is an ideal place for business lunch or weekend quick meal, cozy environment and good service. Not expensive as Central's consuming level, and I will recommend the fries for sure.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-yachiyo-ramen/19327?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
844,Yaki ANA,Causeway Bay,Japanese,3.2,196.0,5.0,"Yaki Ana, located in Causeway Bay's WTC is a mainstream Japanese restaurant serving very main stream dishes. They have other locations, all strategically located inside malls.During lunch time on weekdays, they have lunch sets. It's pretty extensive and it includes everything from sushi to yakitori. Lunch sets include a miso soup, appetizer, chawanmushi and dessert. Menu is in English and Chinese. I decided to come here for lunch before heading to work.This is the chawanmushi. It was layered with chicken broth on top for added flavor. This made the egg way too watery and was more drinkable than scoopable.1Appetizers were pickles. These were ok. Nothing really exceptional about them.0The miso soup was also not much to write home about. Just a regular dashi diluted miso.0I ordered the Japanese skewer set for $178. The photo looked like this with various little salts for dipping.0In actuality, I didn't get any salts for dipping. I guess it was for show? It did come with a super tiny bowl of rice.0There was a total of eight skewers. From left to right: corn, chicken wings, sardine, chicken thigh. The corn wasn't very sweet. Not as sweet as I expect from Japanese corn so I'm suspecting this is not Japanese corn. The chicken wings were pretty good and clearly the standout. They were still juicy and perfectly seasoned. The sardine was not too fishy in taste. The chicken thigh had a nice spread of teriyaki sauce.0From left to righ: tsukune, chicken thigh with leek, shitake mushrooms and leeks. The tsukune was tender with lovely bits of soft bone minced in. But the raw egg yolk that is usually used to accompany it was not provided. The chicken with leek was cooked well with a good basting of teriyaki sauce. The shitake mushrooms were juicy as well. And the leeks were ok.0The dessert was matcha warabi mochi. This was chewy with not much matcha taste.0Overall, the food was decent enough and for that price, I really cannot complain. But service ... what is it about the Lubuds group of restaurtants? Or is it just the ANA series of their group? Because this is the third restaurant from this group where I have received the most horrible service. The only one with good service was The Pho and that was a food court. When I arrived, a staff walked by me and said please wait. So, I did. But then the staff came back and walked right past me and out the door. When he did come back, he ignored me again and went off to serve dishes. I thought to myself ... ok. He's probably just the waiter, so waited. But this same person came back and finally asked me how many people. I said one and he told me to wait while he cleaned a table for me. Are they that understaffed?When I decided to order, it took me a long time to get anyone's attention. It seemed the staff were always so busy cleaning tables to look around. I saw several other people waving hands in the air to attract attention. It got worse when food was just slid across to me from another table. Are you that lazy to not walk one step forward to place the food in front of me instead of reaching over from another table and plopping it down? This happened for my miso soup, my chawanmushi and my dessert. Each time served by different people in the same manner so it wasn't just that one person. I expect food thrown down in front of me if I'm at a dai pai dong or a cha chan teng. But I'm not at one of those places. Trying to attract attention to pay for my bill was also aggravating as no one again looked around while I waved my hand in the air for at least 5 minutes. When I finally caught someone's attention, he acknowledged and never came back. I waited 10 minutes and wondered ... where was my bill? Aggravating to try to attract attention again just so I could pay and get out of there! No matter how good the food tasted, the service was just horrible and for that, I won't be back.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-yaki-ana/469993?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

The quality was ok in general in terms of buffet, although I would say most were quite salty. There were some really fresh and crispy greens, carrot/cucumber/celery sticks, smoked salmon, 3 types of cheese (quality a bit sub-par), cherry tomatoes, sweet corn, some pre-mixed salads with Japanese dressings like sesame, Japanese-style appetisers like  but they were really cold, Japanese-style small dried fish, sliced Italian-style veggies and some cooked chicken slices which were really hard. The oden was ok, although not as good as those served at convenience store in Japan of course! For fruits, there were only some dragon fruits and pineapples. My personal opinion was that, the cost of $138+10% seemed not so justified by this simple buffet, so you really have to top it up by ordering a main.Unagi Don - Eel Rice Bowl$ 660Unagi Don - Eel Rice Bowl$ 66Unagi Don - Eel Rice Bowl$ 660Unagi Don - Eel Rice Bowl$ 66The rice and the eel were hot!

The half boiled egg mixed with the rice made the rice very smooth and was really delicious!Dessert - Chocolate ice cream0Dessert - Chocolate ice creamThe accompanying ice cream was quite thick and dense. A perfect end to the meal!Overall, we had quite a satisfying lunch with reasonably good quality of Japanese food. Service was quite attentive as the waiters/waitresses took away the finished plates quite promptly. It was quiet enough for a nice chat over lunch.

We had been craving some high quality yakiniku again so decided that we would go for yakiniku lunch sets right away. However, there were quite a few choices of yakiniku lunch sets and it took us a while to decide to go for two Deluxe Yakiniku Sets at $220 each. All set came with miso soup, appetizer, salad, rice and ice-cream. We also paid $66 for an extra order of beef tongues + chicken and another $66 for another extra order of chicken + pork.Salad, Appetizer (Bamboo shoot & Beef), Beef Fat & Roast Meat Sauce...0Salad, Appetizer (Bamboo shoot & Beef), Beef Fat & Roast Meat Sauce...The salad and appetizer arrived very soon after they had taken our orders. The salad and bamboo shoot were ok but the beef was so hard so that the below average mark was mostly due to the beef. The roast meat sauce was totally unnecessary because I found that the beef itself was seasoned very well.Deluxe Yakiniku Set$ 2200Deluxe Yakiniku Set$ 220The waitress didn\'t introduce the beef when she brought them to us. So we asked. Those on the left were  which were off the menu while those on the right were flank steak. The flank steak looked pretty mouth-watering right? We asked if there was any recommended order of eating and the waitress answered ""up to you"".0So we started off with the less fatty  before our additional orders arrived. The  were quite yummy. They were not super super tender like those at 298 Nikuya Room but were still ok texture-wise and had strong flavour of beef.Beef Tongues & Chicken, raw on plate$ 660Beef Tongues & Chicken, raw on plate$ 66Then our extra order of beef tongues and chicken arrived. The portion was a bit disappointing because last time our extra order of beef tongues at 298 Nikuya Room was so big and it was only $55!The roasted chicken was very tender, smooth and had strong flavour of chicken. A waiter said they imported everything from Japan. No wonder. We hadn\'t had such high quality chicken in a long time.Beef Tongues0Beef TonguesThe beef tongues were quite chewy, unlike those at 298 Nikuya Room which were super tender. I would say such chewy texture was also good.Flank Steak0Flank SteakFlank Steak0Flank SteakThe flank steak were of course very tender given the fat distribution. But my lunch partner said the  gave a stronger flavour of beef. I personally found the flank steak too fatty. The  was good enough if you wanted to consume less fat.The rice was just plain rice, a lot worse than those offered by 298 Nikuya Room which was so moist and smelt so good. As the rice was not particularly good, I didn\'t ask for more despite the need to eat more rice to balance the fatty meat.Chicken and Pork$ 660Chicken and Pork$ 66Then our extra order of chicken and pork arrived. It arrived last as we didn\'t place this order at the very beginning. There was nothing special with the pork. The pork did taste good but it was too fatty and there were only 2 slices. The above average rating was mostly due to the chicken.Ginger & Red Bean Ice-cream0Ginger & Red Bean Ice-creamOne of the good things about this set was that ice cream was included after eating so much fatty meat! The ginger ice-cream was ok but there were some tiny ice cubes in the red bean ice-cream. Maybe just couldn\'t expect too much from these freebies.Apology for comparing this place with 298 Nikuya Room throughout this commentary given our recent yakiniku experience at 298 and their close location. I would say 298 Nikuya Room was better in terms of the types of beef included in the set (they offered both thin and thick cuts and different parts of the beef for you to try), bigger portions (also taking into account extra orders), service and ventilation. But of course 298 Nikuya Room was slightly more expensive and you couldn\'t occupy their tables for so long during lunch hours. Having said that, it was still a good place to go given that you only need to spend $220 for some really high quality yakiniku from Japan!

847,Yakiniku Futago HK,Causeway Bay,Japanese,3.7,119.0,1.0,"Working life in Hong Kong is known for being hectic and worker bees around the city barely have enough time to have a decent lunch, let alone enjoy it. With the average lunch time being just 1 hour, a lot of people rush out for a quick bite; some just don't even bother and end up ordering delivery. That's why fast food restaurants and online delivery services have a market in our city. Having a schedule this packed, it's no surprise that the idea of leisurely flipping meat briskets and basking in the fumes of a BBQ stove rarely come up as a lunch option. As extra and rebellious as I am, I had to go for it during my weekday lunch hour; surprisingly, it was very manageable and you leave with a filled up stomach, no odor and time to spare.A page of Yakiniku Futago's menu during a weekday lunch period (Thursday)...1A page of Yakiniku Futago's menu during a weekday lunch period (Thursday)...The Yakiku Set w/ extra meat (HK$118)This branch of Futago is located near my office which is right below the J Plus hotel. My friend and I went in without making a reservation and was told that it was full at first (1:15pm); but after a two minute wait they sat us down as I guess some of their customers pulled a no show. Since we got there relatively later than the regular lunch hour, we were told that the bento combos (HK$80+) on the lunch menu were sold out, and we could only order the yakiniku sets, which was what we wanted to get in the first place. We ordered two of the Yakiku Set (bottom left on the menu) with extra meat; the set comes with a bunch of side dishes and a drink.Yakiku Set - The combo comes with rice, salad, egg soup, seaweed, tamagoyaki, and kimchi.

The meat comes separately....$ 118Side DishesThe side dishes of the set were served first. The portion was definitely generous with the rice and salad filled to the top and over. The kimchi is your standard kimchi, but it was a pleasant surprise to see that they have included two pieces of tamagoyaki and seaweed.Yakiku Set: An assortment of beef ribs, pork neck, chicken tender, pork belly, and ox tongue...$ 1180Yakiku Set: An assortment of beef ribs, pork neck, chicken tender, pork belly, and ox tongue...$ 118The MeatThe meat came shortly after. Considering that we ordered the extra meat option, it felt like this was the original size as we left feeling full but not belly out kind of full as I had expected for ordering extra meat. The assortment included beef ribs, pork neck, chicken tender, pork belly, and ox tongue. The briskets were decently sized, but it did give off a feeling that they were scraps. Nonetheless, I do recommend getting the Yakiku Set because it has the most variety of meat.Yakiku Set$ 1180Yakiku Set$ 118The stove was very cute and petite with an exhaust pipe right above it. We got to adjust the flames which added to the fun, but as an infrequent BBQ-er, we burnt quite a few batches. It would be a plus if waiters came over and helped us out a bit when they see that the meat is starting to burn, just like they do in Seoul, Korea. Nonetheless, the meat itself was marinated nicely, definitely full of flavor, and very moist. It tasted great when dipped into the soy sauce with sesame seeds.Yakiku Set with Oolong tea$ 1180Yakiku Set with Oolong tea$ 118The set comes with drink options. I chose an iced Oolong tea to combat the fattiness of the whole meal, and my friend decided to go all out and got a coke.Yakiku Set$ 1180Yakiku Set$ 118Overall the entire lunch experience was great. The restaurant was comfortable, it wasn't too noisy, and it was clean. What made it even more clean was the fact that we were given aprons; that way we would leave without any significant BBQ odor and oil stains. We left the restaurant at approximately 2:00pm, which totaled our dining time to around 45 minutes.

The chain offers quality meat for an inexpensive price.As we were there for lunch, they offer lunch sets featuring one type of meat for grilling. Good for individuals. They also offer non grilling sets as well. But, honestly, why are you here at a yakiniku restaurant and order non grilling items? WHY? They do offer a la carte as well. Menu is in English, Japanese and Chinese.1Each lunch set comes with a soft drink, BIG bowl of rice (that you can ask for free refills), salad, tofu with sesame sauce, pickled appetizers, nori and miso soup. The soup had a strong pork taste. The food that came with the sets were ok. Nothing really worth mentioning. Just ok.0Harami Set ($128). The beef quality was excellent with a good balance of fat to meat ratio. It was marinated in a savory sauce.0Assorted Three Kinds Set ($85). The other set we shared consisted of three different kinds of meat. Two were beef (short rib and loin) and one was pork. Again the meat quality was good especially for this price. The pork was really good as it was tender and moist.0A photo of some grilling action.0For this price, you do get good quality meat. But it wasn't very filling. I was still hungry afterwards and I'm definitely not a big eater. But it does give you a cheaper option for yakiniku as opposed to the other places in Causeway Bay where they do cost a whole lot more.

848,Yakitori Bar,Central,Japanese,4.1,137.5,0.0,"This is a casual little basement restaurant. Community table, bar with high chairs, manga drawings on the wall.Came for lunch on a Sunday and the restaurant was relatively empty.Went for the spicy beef rice bowl (HKD 128 plus service) which consists of the rice bowl, a small salat, a miso soup m, the choice of three skewers and a drink.Salad came first - small bowl of mixed greens, sweet corn with a light dressing. okThen the rest of the set. The rice bowl is similar to a Yoshinoya-bowl, but freshly made, the beef is quite lean and tasty and the onions still have a bit of bite, lots of sauce that is by no means spicy (so the name is a bit misleading), overall quite good. The miso soup is pretty standard and a bit on the salty side. For the skewers I went for sweet potato, mushrooms and green peppers. The sweet potato was in deed quite sweet and had an interesting mushy texture, the shiitake mushrooms had a good taste and texture, but was unfortunately almost cold, the peppers where three little slightly spicy peppers (similar to Spanish padrons) topped with bonito flakes- the best of the three skewers.Overall a satisfying and good value meal in an realized environment - will be back.Spicy beef rice bowl set$ 1280Spicy beef rice bowl set$ 128', 'Having moved to Hong Kong recently, I had a great time exploring new food places. I work in Central and lunch is the perfect time to try out new places around the charming neighborhood off Soho. Me and a coworker checked out Torimen on Elgin Street. Its a 15-minute-walk from where I work but I wouldnt mind doing some walking. It is also a good way to stay active during the day. Torimen is a chic Japanese restaurant slash sake bar. I like its black and white street art design a lot, it gives it a modern urban touch. We sat down and ordered two set lunches right away. I have been starving myself the whole morning and I was happy to see what I have ordered - a grilled mackerel with rice and 3 yakitoris! It also came with a salad and a miso soup! 0The mackerel and yakitoris were grilled to perfection  juicy, flavorful and succulent! It is always great to enjoy a variety of food for lunch. Makes my tummy happy! My friend at work ordered a deep-fried Pork Cutlet with Egg Rice Bowl and its looked absolutely scrumptious! 0There was a lunch deal going on so we enjoyed a 5% off! We asked our server about their happy hour deal and was offered a sake sample too! How sweet of them! It was a great dining experience and we are definitely coming back for some quality sake and more yakitoris after work!                Supplementary InformationFriendly bartenders and a welcoming atmosphere.', ""Apparently this place specialises in both ramen and yakitori skewers. For lunch they offer sets with both (plus a side salad). The salad was small but had a good mix of variety. The signature prawn miso ramen had a rich and slightly spicy soup base, which was quite tasty and unusual. The ramen noodles were quite chewy. There was an additional charge for the onsen egg (which I didn't actually order but decided to have it anyway), which was soft and tasty. The skewers plate, which arrived a bit later, was not particularly memorable (didn't finish) and I found everything a bit dry - some real grilled meat instead of sausage and dried mushroom (and/or some sauce) would have been better.  0Spicy Prawn Miso Ramen0Spicy Prawn Miso Ramen0"", 'Late sunday lunch at 2pm.Unagi Set: $128Fried Chicken +Red seabream ramen set: $108Asahi: $580Boring Salad0Cold Asahi. must be cold.0Layout.

But since it is having a crossover with Panda-a-Panda, I visited with my friend, who is also a fan of this cute panda cartoon character.00Located on the second floor of Wan Chai Pier, the seafood market doesnt really have a convenient location, as you have to walk some nice distance from MTR station. It would only be convenient when you take a ferry here. However, you get to have an awesome harbour view when you dine in, which I enjoyed thoroughly.Mini Burgers0Mini BurgersWe ordered two dishes to share for lunch. These bite size mini burgers were petite, but very delicious indeed. We were stunned when told that the wrapping paper is edible, as its made of rice paper. Interesting taste and texture I would say, not what I expect or would go for again, haha!The burgers were not bad. They were made with freshly toasted crunchy bun. Beef patty of the front burger was juicy; scallop of the back burger was so fresh and meaty. They were both very enjoyable. The salad tasted great with mayo and crab roes, even veggie haters like me ate quite a bit of the salad.Mini Udon0Mini UdonThis mini udon did not disappoint either. The soup base was so rich in flavour yet it wouldnt leave you craving for water afterwards. The udon was al dente, crab sticks were fresh, barbecue pork pieces were cooked right to the point. Onsen egg was made even more awesome with the grumpy Panda-a-Panda print on top!Even though the portion was quite small, it made a reasonably filling lunch for two girls at an affordable price.', 'Im a tourist on holiday and was recommended this restaurant by a friend. However, without a doubt, this has been my worst dining experience in Hong Kong thus far. My parents and I arrived at the restaurant at 12.15, early and excited. However, we did not receive our food until 1 oclock  a long 45-minute wait; the slowness of the service was greatly disappointing. The member of staff, who looked like the manager, explained to us that this lateness was normal, that some days people would normally take a few hours before being served. This was a blatant excuse as a family who arrived after us finished all their food before we were even served, and the restaurant wasnt particularly busy. Even so, Id be surprised why anyone would go to a restaurant where food would only appear a few hours after ordering. I found the service frustrating, and even laughable, especially after it was confirmed to us by another staff that our order was only registered at 12.50. In addition, I am personally outraged by the attitude of the staff. The lack of respect shown by the lack of apologies to my parents when they complained is not only insulting, but, unacceptable. We left the restaurant disappointed, my parents upset expressions clearly visible. A restaurant that doesnt acknowledge its mistakes deserves no praise. If I could give service a minus score, I would not hesitate.', ""I really liked the environment of this while place. Really spacious and a pretty good view looking over to Kowloon. I don't have much to say about the food but I think with the price I pay, this isn't a bad deal. I tried the sushi for this place today and I can't say I was impressed but I guess the value was there. 00000"", 'I was so looking forward to trying out this restaurant to see what all the fuss was about. Upon arrival, I was left wondering around confused at how/what I am supposed to do. I found a member of staff, who explained this over complicated seating/purchase arrangement. Come on - I came to relax and eat some nice food, not work out a compatibility matrix in my head! I was confused and ended up sitting in the wrong area, I really wanted to try the Don so I had to move again to the Don area.I ordered the $265 Premium Don, what a disappointment. I wouldnt rate it as a $100 Don, the only thing I like about it was the rice and that was done by a machine. The minced Tuna Don was also disappointing but at least that was a less waste of money. I actually really wanted to try the Uni, but they didnt even do that anymore because they cannot source enough supply. Also when you spend $500 on a lunch, I expect to have some tea/water included but they charge for this!If you take away the fancy decor, it is just a below average and expensive Japanese restaurant. Even the supermarket section was total disappointment, my local Fusion/Aeon has much better selection and is cheaper. Maybe it was good when it first opened, but it certainly is not good now. It is a shame, could had been really great/special but totally let down by the food and price.'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/wan-chai-yamataka-seafood-market/505807?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

Honestly though, I didn't feel like this place was anything special from other unknown places which serve roast meats. Guess the michelin star standards are somewhat lax these days?However, this place should be commended for the fact that they've managed to stay in business all this time. Central has obviously been the center of financial activity in Hong Kong, and so obviously the attractions and business in the area have changed to become a slightly more 'international' flavor- still, I feel like this trend has picked up a little bit in the past couple of years.

Our friends were from Singapore and US and one of them does not eat pork. We managed to order enough dishes without any pork. One dim sum I wanted to try was traditional shark fin's soup dumpling but we can wait till next time since it has pork inside. The famous pi pa duck. It wasn't as nice as I remembered it to be when Yixin was in Causeway Bay. The whole duck used to be flattened and the inside marinated very nicely. Now it is just like a roast duck and a little too fatty too Fried milk is a dish of fried egg white, milk, crab meat and mushrooms. I didn't use to like it as it tasted too much of milk but this time I did as they added a lot of crab meat which diluted the taste of milk.  Fried beef with yau teo. This is an old fashion Cantonese dish and as I am a yau teo fan, I try to pick out more yau teo pieces and as they slice the dough and deep fry it, it's very crispy and it soaks up the beef sauce making it tasty Fried broccoli was my daughter's choice and I asked them to put less oil. I only had one piece as my daughter took too many pieces. Fried ho fan with beef in black bean sauce. I ordered this as I saw the next table had a dish which looked good. It turned out to be just average. Fried lotus root with lily bulb and sugar snaps. Again my daughter's choice as she loves vegetarian dishes. I saw our US friend didn't like the lily bulb pieces and I agree it has a taste and texture that takes getting used to.  Prawns baked in vermicelli in clay dish was not as nice as I had hoped and as this dish came late, we didn't finish it. Plain rice and congee at Yixin is a good quality, much nicer than most other restaurants, so we ordered some to go with the dishes. Their congee has bean sheets melted inside and so it's smooth and smells distinct. The meal was a gathering of old and new friends, our new friend liked the duck and most of the dishes. We didn't finish some of the dishes and had to pack them to take home. 000000""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-yixin-restaurant/17332?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

858,Yoppi,Central,American,4.4,50.3,0.0,"I bought a $40 worth of cash coupon at $20 from a groupon website months ago, but have always lacked the opportunity to actually redeem the coupon and enjoy the discount of 50%. after the 'small' lunch at Mak's noodles plus some walk up and down soho and central, we stopped at the Yoppi (at last) for a quick (and cheap) fix.the store was filled with foreigners when we arrived. i had to kinda 'compete' for space in front of the self-help yogurt outlets as two teenage girls moved around to squeeze hell lots of froyo into their already-too-full paper cups. i sampled with a little original (really tarty which is nice), rasberry (little sweeter than the original) and some strawberry (artificially pinkish and tastes awful) before i squeezed swirls of original and rasberry yogurt into my small cup.Then came step 2: the toppings. there was quite a large variety to choose from, but many of the dry toppings were not appealing to me - there were a large choice of breakfast cereals but many i dislike, and all you have for dried fruits are only raisins. the granola did not look appealing to me too, and there was nothing between oreo powder and coarsely crushed oreo wedges - if only there were less fine oreo crumbs!  luckily there were the sesame powder and peanut crunches which i really like. The choice of fruits was also wide - they look promisingly fresh and sweet - and we had some blueberries, mango and banana slices (the bananas look freshly cut as they had not been darkened by oxidation). I also spotted the mochis which (i guess) came in original, green apple, orange and strawberry, and i picked the first three flavours. If you were a fan of fruity syrups, there were also a few syrups which you can garnish your hearty cup with.Step 3 - weight and pay. We had a little more than 9 oz and only had to pay $1 extra - that means the heap of froyo with toppings in front of us cost only $21! a bargain indeed. the tarty yogurt and chewy mochis0the tarty yogurt and chewy mochis A short comment on the froyo- i really love how the original flavour is sour here cus what's being served at Milky Cow, the #1 store i ALWAYS go to, is way too sweet. I have told the lady there for numerous times about the sweetness of their base but it seems that nothing has been changed since day 1 of its opening. Afterall, its yogurt they are serving, and yogurt are supposed to be sour, at least. it has to be refreshing and light, and i see no point in having something as milky and heavy as ice creams for snacks or a reducing lunch.The fruits were juicy, sweet and fresh. Really nice. The skin of the blueberries were a little tough however, but they were already good enough, being big and fleshy.Sesame powder and peanut crunches varied the soft and smooth texture of the froyo, bringing in an oriental aroma and taste to the snack from the west. And i really love the mochi - they were chewy but not too tough, and were really tasty, since most mochis are as tasteless as plastic cubes.  this is something different - and the mochis of different flavours actually DID have different tastes. yum yum. the environment was also quite comfortable with all the sofas and chairs and stuff. But one little thing that worth commenting is that i notice the yogurt were melting and dripping from the machines, and the rasperry yogurt was halfway melted when i squeezed..quite scary and unhygienic indeed. but apart from this minor issue everything is cool and nice - sour froyo, fresh toppings, and really lovely sesame powder. i will come again for sure-even if i no longer have the 50% off coupon and have to pay the full fare!"", 'This is my first time to go Yoppi in CentralSince I addict to froyo recently, I search Openrice everyday for the nearest place selling good froyo with low calories or non fat.Finally, I got this place!0Such a large froyo I got here!!!There are many kinds of fruits, candies, poppies etc.I love it exactly!!!Woo, I certainly will come again soon!!!', 'We all planned to have a froyo as a lunch here todaySince we tried it before, thus, we have good impression of the shopWe can try every flavors before choosing your own cupThis is really nice that you can control how much you wanna trymaybe you forgot what original tastes, then you can try again, the service is very goodthe gals wont say much, but they answered your questions on time when you raised any to themI really love the chocolate and original flavors, both are very good, one is very sour, one is not too sweetThe toppings are quite much for us to choose, fruits, chocos, jelly poppers, cereals, candies, etcI really love the blueberries, strawberries, mangoes, jelly poppers and lotte bear biscuits!!!Finally, it weighted as HKD 90!!!OMG, though it was treated by my good friend, however, i also think that it was quite expensive.Main point is, I added much mangoes and blueberries inside my cup... therefore, it is worht actuallyHahahahahahahahahahaNice shop, I certainly will come every week.PLEASE add coupons collection as a bonus for those frequent visitors~000'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-yoppi/48737?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

I think the truffle paste really threw me as I think it was not needed at all. It just covered the true taste of the seafood. The sashimi was ok but the toro tasted really odd. It tasted a bit plastic-like. It also looked artificial. There wasn't a lot of rice so I can see light eaters being able to finish this. Heavy eaters may leave starving.0While eating the uni, I bit into something. It appeared to be bits of shell. I had never come across this before and I wondered if it was cleaned properly?0For this price, I can get a much better quality donburi. The only thing is this place doesn't charge 10% service charge. Otherwise, there are far better places for this in Causeway Bay. Service was a bit scattered. The table next to us waited for their order for quite a while and they had come before me, yet I was served everything.

Their menu is larger, especially for dinner, than most noodle joints or the chain Sad Noodle. I wouldnt say Yu makes the best noodles or soup bases, but it does the job of satisfying your occasional craving of spicy food. In terms of spiciness, you can ask for anywhere from non-spicy all the way to extra spicy. Seating is very limited but waiting staff are fairly helpful.

When I was wondering where I should go to for lunch alone, I suddenly remembered there was a restaurant famous for chicken in the vicinity. My mom brought me there a couple of times when I was a kid (20+ years ago) and my impression was that it was very crowded and the chicken was delicious.  There we go.It was 12:15pm when i walked in, quite empty, and I told the wait staff ""table for one please"". This wait staff pointed me (not led me) to the far end and I sat down. It is the table right outside the washroom but anyway, I would not stay long I thought.  Then I was left at the empty table just like this, without setting up cups and plates for almost 5 minutes while this wait staff did nothing and stood in the middle of the hall. I then waved and asked for his attention loudly and finally he came. Below was the conversation..? wor!?9090OK.He walked away without any achknowledgement.  Then the rice came. There were just two ""items"" on the plate - rice and chicken leg - not even !  The rice was quite hard, similar to the below average fast food shop standard, and the chicken leg is ok, just ok in terms of taste and portion, definitely not worth $90! I ate quickly and asked for the check. The same guy threw a piece of paper (my order) on the table and asked me to bring the paper to the cashier to pay.  Total bill = 90 + 10 (tea) + 10 (service charge - how dare he chraged me as there was absolutely no service at all) = $110.  They charged me $10 for tea and I have no choice of the tea leaf and obviously it was just a pot of tea being reused again and again.I immediately compare this to . I usually go to  for . The rice and food are good (great sometimes), I can choose the tea leaf that I like, the tea is newly made, the wait staffs are attentive, and the bill comes to less than $100 including service chrage - and it is in Central!If the owner of this restaurant is reading this, here is my message to you: Please close the door and don\'t ruin the reputation of HK service industry - the quality in all aspects I experienced in your restaurant is awful!!

865,Yukitei Ramen,Wan Chai,Japanese,2.8,72.3,0.0,"Thickest Tonkotsu Ramen in Wan Chai.  Other than the typical handover cures, i.e. English Breakfast and a ""counter-beer"", I find spicy food helps a lot too. It was quite a while ago since I visited Yukitei. I decided to try out Yukitei and it\'s interesting noodles again.Contrary to the popular book ""Why Men can\'t listen and Women can\'t read maps"", I can\'t read maps. This time it took me quite a while to find the place. It\'s located in one of the smaller alleys along Queens Road, between Pacific Place 3 and Hopewell center (those are the only landmarks I am able to use for orientation  ).It took me 30 minutes walk around the vicinity - twice - to find it.  I didn\'t mind the walk too much as it was a good walk. I saw a strange looking structure along the way.  I initially attributed that to my hangover.  I was so intrigued by that structure that I stood in the middle of Queens Road, zoomed in with my phone and took a photo of it: 0The 30 minutes walk was pretty satisfying (and detoxifying). It\'s helped my hangover significantly so I didn\'t have such a strong urge to have the spicy ramen now. I finally found the place and got a seat outside without queuing. They had a number of electric fans installed so the temperature was fine. The seats were reasonably spaced apart so it was comfortable.This time, I figure I\'ll try their collagen-laden original pork bone soup. But after a second look at the rather extensive menu (they had original, shoyu, miso, curry and gigoku (hell), all of those are pork bone based and further split into two more options: Char Siu or Kakuni), I figure I""ll try their pork bone soup with shoyu.  This was because I had been trying different ramens with shoyu as their soup base, like ""Hinsho Yokohama Ramen"", ""Ryo Tei"" and ""Shugetsu"" and I\'d like to do a bit of comparison.  So I placed my order and asked for Shoyu Ramen with Kakuni (grilled pork belly). I noticed that this time, there wasn\'t a ramen application form to fill in like they used to have.  ...... Actually I think it\'s a relief. I\'m here for a relax lunch, not for another multiple choice test. Just trust the chef and let the chef do his/her thing. I was told that they ran out of Kakuni, which was a real pity as those were delicious.  Those were cut and roasted. It reminded me of Chinese style roast pork. I\'d say it\'s even better than those provided at ""Menya Musashi"" in Kwun Tong, which were pretty good too.This was how it looked like:Kakuni 25.3.20120Kakuni 25.3.2012This is recommended.  After a short wait, my shoyu tonkotsu ramen arrived:0 Broth:The size was pretty substantial, definitely bigger than Hachiban nearby. The tonkotsu (pork bone) broth was thick as always. It was quite filling.It had a lot of collagen in the broth, which is supposed to be very good for skin - no wonder most of the regulars were all ladies!  The texture of the broth was thicker than ""Ippudo"" or ""David Ramen"".  But the taste was not as condensed as Ippudo or ""Kureha"" (that\'s almost like drinking condensed pork essence directly ) The most similar comparison I could think of is ""Daruma"". Nevertheless, the pork bone taste was not as pronounced as Daruma\'s. All in all, more satisfying for your skin than for your taste buds   Though the pork bone taste was not very pronounced, they boosted the taste with some thick shoyu. I think the taste was remotely similar to dark soy sauce used in Chinese cuisine with a fairly strong sake aftertaste. I have to say, I didn\'t know what to expect from this combination. With hindsight, I\'d probably just order the original pork bone ramen instead of the shoyu version. The texture of the broth was already fairly heavy. Mixing in more thick soy sauce made the whole combination even more heavy.I prefer the shoyu ramen at ""Ryo Tei"" at Sheung Wan or ""Hin Shou"" at Jordan a lot more. They use a less overpowering but aromatic shoyu and combined it with a light broth - chicken broth in Ryo Tei and light Tonkotsu broth in Hin Shou.I placed some konbu vinegar halfway through my noodle to text the combination. Interestingly, the vinegar really diluted the collagen quite significantly! However, this is not recommended for the shoyu borth as you could imagine how soy sauce and vinegar would taste like when mixed together.  Haining said that, I note from another ramen shop (the tsukemen shop at Sham Shui Po) that adding konbu vinegar to tonkotsu is a standard way to bring out more taste in the broth. It would be nice for the spicy broth (which I might have used) and I suspect the original tonkotsu broth as well. Noodles:This time I was plesantly surprised by the noodles!  The noodles were significantly ""improved"". They used to have a fairly chewy, slippery type of egg noodle with extra protein added to it.  Somewhat similar to a ""Kurumi"" ramen from Kyushu. The only ramen shop which still provides this type of ramen seemed to be ""Fukuoka Noodle"" at Sai Wan Ho.  This was how the noodles used to look like:Old version0Old versionThe noodles now were a bit thinner and less slippery. Basically, it\'s a lot more similar to a ""normal"" ramen in Tokyo. The texture of the noodles became a lot harder. Perhaps they were still using a similar noodle but cooked it differently. I suppose this is a very significant improvement for customers as many previous reviewers disliked this type of noodle, which I found it a bit odd as well. On the other hand, it\'s a big sacrifice by the shop as they specifically custom-made their ramen to contain extra protein. It\'s idea vs. market demand. Can your idea change the market?  I digress.  The point is that these ramen, while not the best in town, was definitely acceptable. It\'s quite crisp (as opposed to chewy) and had quite a distinct egg taste to it too. Fans of the harder type of Kyushu ramen might like this a lot. No complaints.The egg was quite good. It was well marinated and the center was still a bit runny. Above average. Adding sesame  and spring onions to the thick broth is a very good idea. I believe the seasme might have been fried beforehand, thus bringing out the aroma.The three pieces of char siu were quite good. Not as good at the Kakuni but it had a nice meat taste to it. Those weren\'t too fat but were tender still. Above average as well. No complaints.  The nori (sea weed) was fine too. Good quality nori don\'t get soggy as fast as the normal one and should be grilled first. This was not bad. The big piece of grilled nori at ""Tamashii"" is still the best. The shredded nori at ""Hachiban"" nearby were also a bit better for being more flavourful. The good service is definitely worth highlighting. The staff were very attentive and constantly adds water, politely and with a smile. Very Friendly and made all my dining experiences here pleasant. In conclusion:General F. Igjam  says: The pork bone soup definitely has a lot of collagen and should be good for skin. Taste-wise, the pork taste isn\'t as pronounced as Buta O or even Daruma. But I\'d still recommend the Spicy Ramen with Kakuni. The original tonkotsu ramen might be better than the shoyu version. I believe to enhance the complexity of the broth, the shop might consider adding some chicken carcass when making the broth. However, it\'s still better than those provided by ""Mutekiya"" (yakitori is better) and ""Hachiban"" (Wan Chai branch - Yasai Ramen is better).You will receive a 10% discount if you sit outside during lunch time. Pretty good value.That comes down to HK$54 for a substantial bowl of thick collagen tonkotsu ramen with decent char siu and nice egg. No queue. Good service. All in all, not a bad option for skin care and to quell your urge for sticky tonkotsu ramen! Worth a try   :  Supplementary Information(1) I noticed that they now provide ""tsuke men"" as well, which is a good idea for the hot weather. A lady next to me seemed to be one of the regulars. She was having tsukemen. The chef asked her what she thought of the sauce. She said it was good but she didn\'t mind a stronger taste as well. The chef appeared receptive of comments. The staff were also asking two other customers, who also seemed to be regulars (  ), what they thought about the noodles and generally asked for comments on how they could improve. That\'s a great attitude!  (2) 1st comment of ""Yukitei"":  25th March 2012', 'Yukitei seemed to be the only ramen shop in the Wan Chai area and looked interesting. So I tried it over lunch. Fortunately, there was no queue at 1:30 p.m. and I chose an outdoor counter seat. It\'s quite clean and tidy.  Since it was early spring, it was quite comfortable sitting outside. Eating outside is more casual and spacious. I\'d consider that an authentic ramen experience. As I sat down, the lady stationed outside handed me a piece of paper with customizable ramen. You could choose to fill it in or just place your order with her. As always, I ordered the spicy ramen. I ordered the ""Yukitei Ramen in Spicy Soup"", somewhat modestly named when compared to """" . It had Char Siu, Braised Pork (Kakuni ) and 1/2 an egg. I ""customized"" my noodle as follows:Noodle: SoftSpiciness: Category IIIStock: NormalSpring Onions: NormalAs I was waiting for the noodle, I noticed that there were quite a lot of condiments on the table, including the all important garlic crusher and sesame. That\'s a good start. You\'re provided with a glass of warm water and a packet of green tea. 00After a 6-7 minutes wait, the ramen arrived:(?)-0(?)-The soup was spicy and a bit sweet. It had some chilli powder and strong pork bone base. The pork bone base was somewhat between Daruma (quite light) and Ippudo/ ButaO (stronge). But the broth here was a lot sweeter and thicker than those shops. It\'s quite good. The category III spice should be suitable for those under 18 as well.  The ""hot"" level was similar to a kimchee tofu broth you get at most Korean restaurants but sweeter. As you could see, the presentation of the egg was aesthetically a disaster. I don\'t mind it but some will. Anyway it was nothing special but not bad either. The char siu was a bit fat and substantial. I think it\'s quite good. The kakuni was heavy stuff. It\'s similar to the roast pork you get at Chinese restaurants but without the crispy skin. 0The noodle was apparently Kyushu type (straight type) with extra protein added to it. As a result, it was very very smooth (slippery) and a bit like glass noodles with an eggy taste. The noodle here is similar to those provided in ""Fukuoka Noodle"". It\'s apparently a different style from Kurumi, Kyushu. I think this is an acquired taste. I\'m not a fan of this type of noodle - not with this type of broth anyway - and I\'d suggest you order the hardest noodle type to reduce the culture shock.If you haven\'t tried this type of ramen before, you might be a bit surprised by the texture and you\'ll either love it or hate it. Anyway, there is no need to think you\'ve been cheated. It\'s still authentic Japanese, just very different from the more commonly available ramen in Hong Kong.The service was good. All the staff were friendly. I asked why 7 dollars was knocked off my bill. I was informed that you\'ll receive a 10% discount if you sit outside, during lunchtime.  That was nice. There were many more seats outside anyway, about 10 ( I only saw about 6 seats inside). All in all, the broth was quite good. The noodle is an acquired taste. Worth a try.!0! 0', ""This has got to be hands down the WORST ramen experience I have had EVER   I had it for lunch today and I've had 4 glasses of water and am STILL thirsty.I chose the BBQ Pork ramen with the pork bone soup.  Although they let you choose how you want your ramen cooked, it still came soft and soggy.  The soup was the worst thing I've tasted in a long time, it came with 2 cms of oil floating and there is no taste apart from the oil.  I ordered a side of the corn which they put in the ramen and the corn was still COLD when it arrived.  I tried to use the seasoning powder to drown the taste but it was so awful that I left after 3 mouthfuls.  I don't want to waste my food quota on GARBAGE.The best thing about this whole dining experience was the staff, very polite and courteous.""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/wan-chai-yukitei-ramen/50883?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

The shrimps in the dumplings were so fresh and crisp; the spicy ones were indeed very spicy yet we stilled finished them all. The piggy buns looks super cute and we didnt even want to eat them... even the simple stir-fry kale with garlic was delicious! They were a little bit rough to eat but its just the texture of kale.

There are some food you must not miss.  the molten custard steamed bun),  pineapple pastry in a bird cage), fried spicy  turnip cake. I would highly recommend their exquisite dim sum. Each of the dim sum has its own characters with good taste. But please be reminded that most of dim sum are just available before 6:00. 0000', ""looks good, some are very cute, but tastes really bad. perfect for tourist to Instagram but paying double the price for some really awful food. either you steam the turnip cake, or fired it. not steam it then fired it to save time and make it so sticky. the carrot thingy looks great as the photos show but it was virtually hollow with so much oil inside. all the buns are ok ish but I wouldn't say is amazing tho. love the fact that it was msg free, only comes with tons of oil. service virtually doesn't exist, they just don't come to clean up the table or refill the tea pot...when we first sat down we needed to ask the waiter to change the choicksticks as there was some dirt on it...she wasn't pleased but well...ok on the credit side....dessert looks great and taste pretty good.

This is our first time to this restaurant but we've always wanted to try it out. We were able to be seated earlier than my original booking at 11:45. We were warmly welcomed firstly by Ms Kalpana who was kind enough to answer all my questions relating to Asia Miles. She was very nice, patient and knowledgeable.Then we met another friendly face, Ms Bing. She was happy to serve our table throughout our time there. She was also informative as she shared a bit of background information of the restaurant as well as some tips on our choices. We could tell that she was proud and happy to be part of the team.The food did not disappoint us at all. It looked and tasted delicious. You could opt for the lunch set or even just the dessert set. However, since it wasn't our first 'yum cha' experience in Hong Kong and we're not tourists either, we made up our own set of dishes from the main menus, including another set involving 2 appetizers and 1 main dish for $119. Best to read through the whole menu because we almost missed that option!The atmosphere was bright and relaxing overall. Although we weren't pleased that despite the restaurant being fairly 'empty' at the time, the next pair of customers just happened to be our neighbours. They were quite noisy, which ruined the mood a bit. Nonetheless, the food was great. The dishes came out hot and were delivered at a good pace. If you're particular about which dishes you'd like to eat first, you probably have to inform the staff as the first 2 dish that we had were the florette buns with a hint of red bean (condensed milk for dipping) and the custard-filled buns (the one and only, as marketed everywhere in Hong Kong). Though we did not mind, however when we do come for the next round, we'd prefer to have the dishes in order (hot apps > main > dessert).Overall, we had a great lunch and we enjoyed taking photos right after. Many thanks to the Yum Cha staff in Central for giving us, especially my mom, another happy and brand new version of a yumcha experience. We'll be back again soon 0000000"", ""We went earlier to lunch because we know it's hard to find a seat during the period.

Nevertheless, fate brought the restaurant and I together after obtaining an internship opportunity in Central. So yes, I did become a copycat at the end.Back to the main point, the restaurant. The setting is adorable there; many good spots for pics especially the open kitchen where you can see the chefs kneading the dough. They have a lot of options on the menu, starting from starters to dim sum to 'big dishes'.Being hard-working employees like ourselves, we decided to order several dishes to satisfy our poor empty tummies, as the waiters warned us that the buns would take a while to prepare. And they weren't kidding, not just the buns but ALL OF THEIR DISHES TOOK FOREVER TO GET TO OUR TABLE.Anyway, we ordered BBQ piggy buns, hot custard molten buns, steamed shrimp rice roll, a chicken dish I can't remember the name now but not worth ordering and the truffle e-fu noodles.0Out of all these dishes, I highly recommend the truffle e-fu noodles - super flavourful and not as oily as normal e-fu noodles are from Cha Chaan Teng. It was the best dish out of all! For the buns, let's be honest, they were just for the instagram Bloomerang - nothing special at all.0So to conclude, I think it is totally worth going, but just be prepared that your wallet won't be as satisfied as your tummy. That's all for now, have fun!"", ""Fancied this place with very bright interiors and cute alien buns so it has been on my to-try list of restaurants. Ordered 5 dishes for 2 pax and we couldn't finish them all. I ordered the truffle ee-noodles () and 2 different types of alien buns: the matcha () and the molten custard yolk (), along with some prawn dumplings (), carrot cake () and white egg-yolk w lobster and crab meat. The truffle e-noodles had a great truffle taste to it and I feel like it tasted more like a pasta to me rather than e-noodle although it was a great twist. I loved the alien buns as they looked super cute with those eyes (edible too) and the fillings are not solidified, and aren't too sweet and it's a really good snack to have if you aren't looking to eat a whole meal like we did. I've gotta say the names are pretty amusing as my bf and I had a great laugh at them for quite some time. We thoroughly enjoyed the food, I loved the truffle noodles and the matcha buns most.0 Molten Custard Buns0 Molten Custard BunsTruffle Ee-noodles0Truffle Ee-noodles Matcha green tea buns0 Matcha green tea buns"", 'This is my second visit to the restaurant as I wanted to take my family to try something different from the average dim sum restaurant. We ordered 5 types of dimsum and 3 dishes, which was enough for 4 adults.My fave was the steamed vegetable dumpling with truffle (), we ordered 2 of these. Allow thedumpling to just cool slightly before consuming as the skin then tends to have a little more bite (like glutinous rice).Do notexpect to really taste thechopped vegetable filling as the truffle taste was quite strong, though not considered overpowering.0The presentation of the pineapple pastry ()was nice, coming to the table in a little birdcage, but it looked better than it tasted. The pastry was nice and crumbly, but the pineapple jam filling was overly sweet and tastedas if pineapple essence or flavoring was used. This is not something I will order again.1Buns in this restaurant come in cute little designs. The barbequed pork bun () came in the shape ofa white piggy face whilst the molten custard bun ()were little orange bunswith eyes. Both had nice soft buns and the custard cream was not overly sweet with a slightly saltiness to it.00The shrimp dumplings () had a generous portion of prawns and tasted fine, but was unspectacular. I willprefer if theyhad left out the coloring and gold leafwhich added nothing to the flavor of the dumplings.1I did not taste thespicy turnip cake (), but it was one ofa handful of turnip cakes from dimsum restaurants that my momfound acceptable. One of the pluses is that it did not come to the table doused in oil.0The fried squid tentacles () was thankfully not overcooked, but the batter was unfortunately more oily than crispy during consumption.0Their version of the fried french beans () came with a little twist - it was coated in salted egg yolk. This was another favorite, as the beans were not softbut just cooked enough to lose the raw taste. The only fault may be that it was just asmidge over-salted, but that was to be expected with salted egg.0Service was friendly and fairly attentive. Making a reservation is recommended as they seemed quite packed on the weekends. This is a place I will consider bringing visiting friends, to experience the fun of dimsum.', ""1Be sure to book the table before picking this dim sum place. But this is a place perfect for gathering and introduce the Chinese culture to foreigners. Once inside, you will be attracted by the classy interior design. Yet, there are contemporary decorative items, like Chinese serving utensils.

But I guess my friend has helped to piked the general ones of Chinese dim sums.

Overall a family friendly, modern yum cha expirience.', ""0I love that Hong Kong is a central hub for many flights coming from Europe to Australia (or vice versa). It means that we often have friends stopping by, sometimes for a few days and other times for just 24 hours. One of the girl's great friends and her family were coming back from a family holiday and managed to spend a fun filled day in our new city.We're no strangers to having meals with Fi and Kev, with the girl and Fi having regular get togethers in the Indian restaurants of Brisbane. I'd even bumped into Kev in the UK one time and we shared an interesting dinner at Two Michelin starred Hibiscus (see post here). For this short trip, we'd arranged two dining extravaganzas, the first of which was at one of Hong Kong's most interesting and fun Chinese restaurants, Yum Cha.Now, yum cha is both the name of a restaurant and also a style of cuisine, which roughly translates to 'drink tea' and/or 'going for dim sum' - small, bite sized portions of Cantonese cuisine. What makes Yum Cha the restaurant so incredible is the fun and unique manner in which they present their dim sum. In fact, some of the dim sum is so interesting to look at, it's almost a shame to eat!Covering a massive 6,000 square feet on the fringes of Central, Yum Cha distinguishes itself with it's high ceilings that are reminiscent of a New York style loft. With it's high ceilings and large windows, there is a bright and airy feel to the dining area. What I loved as I wandered up the escalators to the entrance of Yum Cha was the full scale truck that dominated the entrance and was used for displaying the restaurant's opening times (of course, seems legit!)0Chef Winson Yip is the head chef of Yum Cha and has been responsible for creating some of the most Instagram worthy food seen on the net. The philosophy at Yum Cha is to serve traditional Chinese dishes and dim sum but with a very modern twist. The team proudly pronounce that their food is infused with a playfulness that maintains traditional flavours and most importantly, is free of MSG.We'd made a booking for lunch and arrived right on our allotted time, but were disappointed to note that our table had been given away already. So much for a booking system. Thankfully, the team were able to find a table, albeit a little small for our groups number of six - ahhh, what are you gonna do - this is Hong Kong. Everything's cramped, so why not our table for lunch.With an eclectic group at the table that included pescatarians and vegetarians, along with fully fledged meat eaters and with Fi recovering from a bout of food poisoning, we took to the the comprehensive Yum Cha menu with gusto, ordering a raft of dim sum and other Chinese delicacies with a view to keeping everyone happy. Before too long, we had round after round of food delivered to our table and I got busy taking photos of some of the cute looking food.I'm gonna talk about our food quite out of order for this post, mainly because I was so enamoured with some of the dishes, that were indeed crying out for posting to Instagram.With a degree of cuteness that was almost overpowering, we loved the BBQ piggy pork buns that when presented to the table looked like three little pigs trying to escape from a future that they knew all too well. Like the fates of the three little pigs in Red Riding Hood, the fate of our cute shaped pork buns was pre determined! Munch and crunch, our little piggies were devoured and the sweet pork filling tasting as delicious on our palates as they had been visually.1Just as cute were the hot custard buns that resembled a cross between the heads of minions and a Sesame Street character. With beady little eyes that gave the appearance of staring off vacantly into space, our little custard buns obviously knew that their fate was to be aligned with the little piggy pork buns. The hot custard inside the buns was bright orange and oh-so-sweet. Very much the dessert option from our meal, the table was completely enamoured with the treats; but no so much that we didn't devour them in seconds.1While the piggy pork buns and the hot custard buns were the most visually appealing dim sum from our meal, there was also a serious side to chef Winson's menu and I particularly loved the translucent shrimp dumpling, which were lovely and sweet; as well as the very traditional crab roe and pork dumplings, which were covered in vibrant orange roe. The sweet pork contrasting nicely with the salty roe.00I wasn't a huge fan of the sticky rice dumplings, but I had to admit that the looked quite lovely. Luckily, it wasn't all about me and the sticky dumplings were quickly devoured by the non meat eaters at the table! The naked vegetable dumplings were also a hit for the vegetarians at the table, although I admit to not trying the dish because -well, they were vegetables!00There were some other traditional Chinese dishes that we tried as well, oh, when I say we, I mean Fi, Kev and the girls. Broiled cabbage and crab roe sesame spinach are not really food substances that I'm going to eat too readily, but it was fair to say that they were appreciated by our weary travelling friends who'd not been long off their flight.000It was my first visit to Yum Cha and I found the dim sum to be tasty and very entertaining. The girl had been a number of times with her workmates, with the location perfectly located for office workers to get their lunchtime dim sum hit.It's probably not a restaurant that I'd add to my regular roster for dining out, firstly, it's a little far out of my way and secondly, while I did quite like the novelty factor, my favourite spot to eat Chinese remains Din Tai Fung.However, this is a place that you have to try out, for the kitsch factor alone - those BBQ piggy pork buns have to be the best thing I've seen in food for a long time - so cute. I'm positive that Yum Cha will be incredibly popular with local Hong Kongers and is definitely a spot that if you're in HK for only a short time is worth checking out.@FoodMeUpScotty0Ahhh, nothing like a local beer after a long flight!0Even our bowls were cute with little goldfish baked inThe Dim Sum at Yum Cha - so pretty and cute010Yum Cha is light and airy - like a NYC Loft000Supplementary InformationGet your camera ready - you need to post to Instagram"", ""Yum Cha on weekend after the sending off pompompurin for its birthday party!

Its tucked in the end of a secret food street, Chiu Lung Street, in the hub of Central district.  No super long queues because it is not cheap in price for the portion in comparison to what other restaurants offered along that street.  0Ox tongue soup rice noodle was never disappointing, I loved how it was thickly cut and texture was always super soft and moist.  Together with the  spicy sour preserved vegetables topping (+HK$6), it got me addicted.  The soup base is always a very clear and delicate beef broth which has so much flavour, this alone, in my opinion is worth the money.0Recently I tried this drunken chicken wings, I was lucky because by 1:40pm, this was the last order left.  I loved how it tasted very home made, because this small old restaurant did not make huge batches.  The drunken sauce was done just right - sweetness, tanginess of alcohol was very gentle yet enough to make it thoroughly absorbed.  Texture of meat was bouncy, and so was the skin. Size of the wings were also excellent!I can recommend more and more.... beef tendon soup rice noodles (), beef brisket soup rice noodles ()...deep fried fish balls () and ginger scallion noodles ()...', ""I'm a frequent Yummy Noodles customer at lunch time (not to confuse with the one 2 stores away with the same name but without the word 'Noodle' at the end), the food is consistently good - I might be biased here as I always have the same food.I was reluctant to try this place before just because it isn't a traditional (historical) noodle shop you can find elsewhere in Central. After my first visit, it has definitely changed my naive mindset and become a regular customer.Recommended Food: Signature Beef Brisket Noodle - can be served in either soup or as lo mein (stirred noodle)It is one of the best beef brisket I had, not only it's soft in texture, it has also brought out the original taste from the beef well. Thin egg noodle cooked really well too and most importantly -it's 'al dente'. If you are hungry, lo mein is probably a better choice as the portion is huge with an extra $6. Otherwise, noodle in soup with additional veggie should have satisfied most office workers appetite.I am not sure what other food's like. But my food buddies were also impressed with the food there except for the rice noodle.

870,Yummy,Central,Chinese,3.5,38.0,2.0,"Was told about this takeaway outlet so asked someone to buy for me.Apparently, this chain does nomt use MSG or so they say. The beef brisket on noodles is very good. Unlike the usual chunky variety, this brisket is cut in slices, like pastrami (but a bit thicker). The texture is very enjoyable, not too chewy and certainly not rubbery. It is not overly fatty and there is very little grease. The noodles are firm which is what I like. Soup is packed separately, to protect the noodles from getting soggy. Makes for a great (light) lunch!000'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-yummy/34424?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
871,Yun Yan,Causeway Bay,Chinese,4.3,150.0,0.0,"So my friend whos visiting wanted to have Szechuan food while shes in town and lucky for her, Im always craving for spicy food  We decided to try out Yun Yan at Times Square which had been on my wishlist for a while. The restaurant moved here from their old location at TST and serves more modern, fusion-esque Szechuan cuisine.Although we went on a Sunday afternoon (not to mention it was the Rugby 7 weekend), the restaurant was rather empty compared to the dimsum restaurants next door. The interior is bright, spacious and very modern looking.0Its hard to tell from the panorama but the tables are huge! We had a hard time hearing each other haha.Instead of the usual peanuts each table is served with a small bowl of glazed spicy popcorn to start. That made me super super happy because Im a sucker for sweet popcorn plus anything with peppercorn in it ^_^Spicy Popcorn0Spicy PopcornIt was light and not overly spicy  if I had this at home I could demolish a whole bag of this by myself heheheAt the long table where we were sitting there were mini condiment bars wedged between every 4 seats. While I like the variety of the sauces it felt weird to have to reach across the customers sitting next to us for it.Spicy Condiments0Spicy CondimentsSince there were only two of us that day we didnt order a lot. After looking through the menu for 10 minutes we decided to order a main dish and a side dish to share.The side came first  Lampshade Beef  which is one of their specialties.0-It is so-named because the beef is so translucent that it resembles lampshades, and light is able to pass through it. Google tells me that the preparation process is quite complicated, which involves marinating, drying, baking, steaming, deep frying & stir frying. This is definitely something you would want to eat outside ;)-Ive never had this dish before so I cant tell if theyve done it well or not. The taste is unusual  it is very sweet but still had a very strong beefy taste. It also wasnt too spicy-Instead of being crunchy as Id imagined, it actually turned chewy in my mouth and got both of our jaws tired from chewing too much haha-I think this is an interesting dish worth trying  though Id recommend sharing it with more people so that you dont tire your jaws outFor our main we ordered Rice Cake with Marinated Pork 0-We actually found more veggies than meat in this dish, but thats okay because we both love munching on the crunchy spring onion-The star of this dish is really the rice cake. They are pan fried before being stir fried with the other ingredients, which gave each piece a light crust. It was slightly crunch on the outside the inside remains soft and chewy. I loved it! My friend didnt though as she prefers the more traditional, wet kind of stir fried rice cake-The dish itself wasnt spicy but thats fine since it gave us a chance to try the different condiments.To finish off our meal I ordered what I came here for  their peppercorn ice cream!Peppercorn Ice Cream0Peppercorn Ice CreamThis is just as good as I imagined  sweet, only slightly spicy but there is no lack of numbing sensation from the peppercorn! If only they made the ice cream less icy in texture then it would have been perfect! Our bill totalled to around $280 so its rather pricy.

The fish neither tasted particularly fresh nor unfresh; in other words, very mediocre. Tuna was not much better than Sen-ryo type quality- Second course: My dining partner had the roasted lamb while I had the noodles. He said the lamb was a bit dry and tough, while my noodles were downright awful. It tasted like the instant noodles or cold ramen you could get in chain restaurants bathed in a tasteless sauce (not even spicy per the description, or maybe watered down for non-Asian tastebuds).

We went there after our yoga class on Saturday and we didn't wait too long even without any reservation, i.e., approximately 12 minutes.I am pleasantly surprised by the tidy and avant garde decor of the venue; especially when I wasn't expecting much in the first place (we just happened to be in the Wanchai Queens Road area and was in the proximity of the QRE building).  The tables, the chairs, and the menus were also much higher than one would expect of a restaurant in this neighborhood.  The ambience of af a restaurant is tres important to me; if you are the same, then this restaurant is definitely your cup of tea.The food was once again, excellent, especially if one takes its price range into consideration ($300-400 per person without alcoholic drinks).  The set lunch included a choice of a soup or a salad (I chose a tomato soup and it was delicious; moderately salted and the sourness was about right), I gave my Soba (Main Course) to my daughter and she loved it. Soba was slightly tasteless in my opinion, more sesame sauce would be needed to make it more palatable.  For dessert, my daughter chose Chocolate Trio which was artfully arranged.  I had a spoonful of that and decided that the taste was above average, but not exemplary.  I also ordered two scallop carpaccios--my favorite amongst all the food I've ordered hence two portions.  The scallops were superbly seasoned and their freshness did not fall short of those tasted in five-star hotels or two-Michelin-Star restaurants.  My mother had a Crab Salad. She said the crab meats were quite fresh but she thought there weren't enough dressings for the salad so it tasted quite bland.  I am not particularly fond of the services there.  I brought my daughter who is an extremely well-behaved six-year-old, and though they were very nice and friendly to me, they did not show much likeness for her presence there. So it's definitely not a kids-friendly place."", ""Naturally attracted to this place because of its convenient location and decor. And of course for the novelty.

Classic Caesar saladClassic Caesar - average 0Classic Caesar - average Mediocre caesar salad. The plate used was long and rectangular...not particularly convenient I'd say but novel. Portion kind of small for me, would've preferred more greens! Black pepper overload. Croutons were under-baked (not enough coloring). Cherry tomatoes were juicy, but not very sweet. Anchovies were incorporated into the dressing. Norwegian pan-fried salmonPan-seared Norwegian salmon0Pan-seared Norwegian salmonMy pick. The salmon was yummy and fatty with a nice creamy mushroom sauce and CHEESE on the side. (see below for the origins of the cheese). I used to cook salmon for myself in CA but salmon steaks are really too pricey in HK. Would rather go out for a nicely prepared steak than have to cook at home - sloth. I liked my steak medium well-done. The skin was crisp, not slimy . And the fish itself was quite oily - not dry at all. Well-seasoned. The watercress&fennel added a nice crunch to the fresh leafy salad tossed in OO, lemon juice and sprinkled with black pepper. Could've given me more than 2 sticks of tender, buttery baby asparagus though, I am rather fond of them. Penne bolognaisePenne bolognaise - needs more sauce0Penne bolognaise - needs more saucePenne more slender than usual, cooked al dente beef ragout was yummy and soft but not sticky enough because I guess it was not cooked long enough for the collagen to come out. There wasn't enough sauce to coat the pasta, which was a pity. I'd have imagined a really sticky, intense beefy sauce, clinging onto every piece of penne. Potatoes gnocchi with mixed mushroom and pesto creamPotatoes gnocchi0Potatoes gnocchiNot authentic, according to H (whose taste I do trust). I had a few bites. Personally I think it's too much carb, but for those who like the chewy, semi-glutinous texture of the classic gnocchi, this dish will satisfy. The mushroom sauce had the right consistency - not too thick, not too creamy, but the shrooms lacked flavour. Perhaps using fragrant species (portobello, crimini, chanterelles) would do the trick. Or, simply, seasoning the mushrooms adequately. We skipped dessert.H and I went cookie-tasting instead along QRE - so many botique cookie stores along the way to PP3. Conclusion:Given the reasonable price and pleasant decor, it is likely that I will revisit on a casual occasion. This is not a fancy restaurant. Food quality could be upped though!  looking forward to further improvements and variations in the menu.                 Supplementary InformationI requested 'dressing and cheese on the side' for my salad. I think the waiter misunderstood me to refer to my main dish. I was puzzled when my salad came without alterations, but understood why my salmon came, dutifully, with 'mushroom sauce' and 'kraft cheese sprinkling' on the side. ^^'' Pretty amusing.

To prevent from getting wet, we walked all the way from Pacific Place I&II to Pacific Place III via the underground tunnels, which were really conveinent and took us 10 minutes to go to Wan Chai from Admiralty. This Caffe Habitu is right opposite to the exit of Pacific Place III~The Roman Italian pizza was fair enough, crust was very thin, but the contents are not full enough.

The rice is also tempting as mixed with coconut oil.0This is a real good one for lunch although price is not cheap but still acceptable in Admiralty or Central area.', ""Last Saturday, I received a call from my Office telling me there was some urgent plant management that would require my help. Actually, there are junior plant management consultants available, why do they need to ask me, a senior plant management supervisor to do this!Anyway, after managing plants for a whole morning, I was quite hungry, so I decided to go to the nearby Shopping Centre for lunch. My colleague also came with me. Since, it was our work anniversay, I decided to andbuy his lunch as well (we have worked together for 13 years and he helped me moved house and picked my daughter up from school some times).0I was immediately attracted to Can-Teen, because I htought the price would be similar to a normal canteen, but I was wrong. We ordered the following:1) Tofu, Tomato, Broccoli with Lemon Grass and Rice - I really enjoy this, there were lots of broccoli, the tomato and lemon grass sauce was very tangy. The tofu was also very crispy and full of bean taste.I could smell plant smell, but I don't whether it is the food or my colleague. Anyway, I like the fresh cut grass smell.Tofu, Broccoli, Tomato, Lemon Grass0Tofu, Broccoli, Tomato, Lemon Grass2) Cabbage Soup () - My colleague had the soup, he said it has many ingredients.

He was very grateful for my generosity.Cabbage Soup0Cabbage SoupI was full and because I shared my white rice with my colleague, he was also full. He was very happy that I bought him lunch and he gave me a card to celebrate our anniversay. He said, next time, he has to and invite me to 7-11 for tea.Overall, I think Can-Teen was very good and relaxing place for lunch, however it was quite expensive.

886,da Via,Wan Chai,Italian,3.2,112.5,1.0,"It was I Felt Like Salad Friday. da Via had approx.. 6 pre-mixed choices (half were pastas). The large salad was served pretty much in an iphone 6 Plus box (I like to be right so I measured it!). *Side note: I seriously had an iphone 4, fine, 4C-size salad somewhere else in the same neighborhood, and that was a large. Im glad iphones are getting bigger and bigger.* Hong Kong makes most salad take-out so precious(ly pricey). BUT Mr Nice Server packed the box so it was filling enough to get me through the afternoon, plus the caffeine in my black coffee, of course.A large box could choose 3 salad options. I chose my pasta and was having a hard time deciding on the last 2 veggies. Mr Nice Server saw my oh, so sad face and let me have some of everything, secretly when the boss was not watching. *You see? This is the kind of service that gets you to feel better about paying more for a 128GB upgrade than sticking to the basic.*All the pre-mixed salads at da Via relied on olive oil, a bit of salt, pepper and herbs. The olive oil was smooth and not grassy. I can see people saying the salads being a bit bland in terms of flavor but I like them. Most pre-mixes out there are usually very saucey, creamy, garlicky, sugary, curry curry guarantee to leave your palate hella confused after cramping into ONE box. The last few (drenched) bites are the hardest to endure but I wont dare to throw them away because the price equals to 2 lunchboxes at cha chan tang-s.Back to my salad box - $68; with a coffee - $30Large salad + Americano$ 980Large salad + Americano$ 98Orange & flannels  The flannels were cooked soft but retaining their crunchiness. Well coated with oil dressing and the fresh orange chunks gave off very summer vibe. If you need fibers, this would be the choice. I envisaged it being chilled further and eating it at the beach with a cider.Octopus & potato  Tender baby octopus (no chewing on tires), lightly salted with just the right amount of flavor, some parsley and yellow potatoes with a bit of vinegar. This was my favorite among the choices.Fregula  Little bead-like pasta varied in colors of toasted bread and the texture was a little coarser than regular pasta. The internet said its the cousin of couscous. The raisin, celery and toasted red pepper combination balance out the carb-filled feeling. I had a lot of them in the box so it was like eating rice but definitely more interesting than regular penne or fusilli salad.Grilled vegetables  A mixture of bell pepper, zucchini and peppercorn. I wished they could add eggplants. The peppers were very sweet so I saved the best bites for last to eat with the fregula.da Via is fairly new to the neighborhood and already attracting a well mix of customers (locals and local-foreigners). Its good to see that the kitchen and servicing counters take up a large portion of the place; the owners are willing to let their staff have a comfortable working space vs. lets packed in the tables so we can (hopefully) pay the d*mn rent! Guests have to actually sit closely together among the tables and window seats but can always grab & ciao like da Via says.There is also a mini-mini bar at the back. The place also has a lot more menu options than what you see displaying at the counters. Sometimes the restaurant is slightly under staff but everyone you can see that they are trying their best. Its also great seeing the found duo being hands on with serving and prepping the dishes.', 'I was with three other colleagues, and we arrived at the restaurant around noon. There were plenty of seats available so we had no problem getting a table. The staff were fresh-faced and friendly, greeting us rather enthusiastically. The environment appeared clean and spacious.They had some daily pastas at around HK$65-HK$80 from memory. Two colleagues ordered the tomato-based daily pasta, the other colleague had a lasagna and I had a salad.The way it works is similar to a canteen, where you go up to the till, place your order, pay and wait for your food before bringing it to your seat (I think sometimes they\'ll bring it to you). The pasta and lasagna come served on a paper plate. The salad comes in a paper box. You pick three items for a large salad, and it costs around HK$70. I was slightly appalled at the size of the box - it was very tiny for a $70 salad box (compared to places like Simplylife, Urban Bakery, Great Food Hall, Oliver\'s supermarket where you can get takeaway ""pick-and-mix"" salad). I was even more appalled when the lady serving me didn\'t even fill up the box! I think she gave me one extra piece of broccoli and said, ""just this once"", when I expressed my disappointment.I was pretty annoyed at the small portion, but what annoyed me even more was when I was not quite finished with the already measly salad and put my fork down to chat/rest, the waitress came over to try to take it away!! I was like ""Nooooooo, I\'m not done!!! Don\'t take what little food I have away!"" She basically did the same thing to my colleagues a few minutes later, trying to clear their plates away before they were done. I told her to calm down, and she said that it was the ""Italian"" way of doing this. I\'m no expert on Italian culture, but I\'ve been there on holiday a few times and not once has this happened to me in Italy??The salad was very nice, with fresh ingredients (I think) and flavoured nicely. My colleagues said that their pasta tasted quite good too. But all in all, not very good value and the staff kind of annoy me by being way too keen!

Menu is English and Chinese. Mains are all under $100.00The appetizer was a cream of corn soup. It was ok. Creamy but could have been a bit more sweeter.0The main I chose was the duck ravioli with smoked potato ($98). The potato was actually a puree and really didn't taste smokey. The ravioli was good yet some inconsistent. The duck meat was more of a mince and had a mix of shitake mushrooms mixed in it. Some of the ravioli was a bit underdone as the skin was too thick. But then some of the skin was thin like a wonton and just right.0The dessert was a sponge cake soaked in syrup with a yuzu sorbet and meringue crisp. The meringue crisp was chewy and not crispy at all. The yuzu sorbet was great palate cleanser. The sponge cake was sweet but not too sweet.0The food was quite good with a few problems. But overall was delicious enough. It was also quite filling even if it looked small. The only thing was the service. How bored were the people working there? Did they even care that they are working? No smile. No thank you. Just a plomping down of my food without a word. From ordering to even asking for the bill, I got nothing but a grunt.

But I was hungry and in the mood for a nice lunch. I had visited the place before a few times on working days, and those times were decent. So I figured weekend would be the same. I have never been so wrong before in my life. My main course was the beef short ribs ($228). The menu said slow cooked, but either the beef was extremely old, or their cooking method involves boiling all the moisture out of the meat, slowly and agonizingly. I did try to save it. I asked for more sauce (there were a few desultory drips on the plate) but the waiter said they had no sauce left. Errr okay. They had mustard which didn't help. Hot sauce on tough meat (short rib is supposed to be soft by definition) wasn't any good. I ended up returning most of it to the kitchen. I've almost never done that before. And it made me whip out the phone and write this review, and I haven't written any Openrice reviews in a very long time.

Somehow they have our booking details but did not have a available table for us when we arrived on time. Anyway the manager offered us to wait at the bar table.

The interior arrangement of the tables was nice, as it gave a spacious feel and a much needed respite from the HK lunchtime crowd. From the prix fixe menu, i selected the octopus, potato foam, potato and parsley for the starter; pan seared barramundi fillet, jerusalem artichoke, sour cream and sauteed vegetable for the main; and for dessert i was offered a lemon tart as the two choices on the menu consisted of some alcohol that were not so pregnancy-friendly.There was olive oil and balsamic vinegar on our table, but our bread basket took a long time to arrive, and we thought that perhaps we were not going to get it as we were already getting quite a good deal from the restaurant week prix fixe menu. It did arrive after what seemed like ages (more than 20 minutes), and the waiter expressed his apologies for the delay.The bread basket was a saviour and we noticed that the bread baskets on the other tables were all empty, so we deduced that the other diners had also waited a bit for their food and hence had finished the bread while waiting. Our starters arrived and the octopus, potato foam, potato and parsley was very good.Then we proceeded to wait for a rather long time for the main course to arrive. While waiting, we observed that the waiters were all very busy trying to bring out new dishes from the kitchen to serve to the diners, as well as trying to clear dishes from tables where the diners had finished their food. However, it was a bit disorganized as some papers stuck to the dishes that were freshly brought out from the kitchen started to fly away (presumably, the papers were marked to indicate which tables they were for), and as they were placed in a row on the counter, the waiters had to make a few extra trips to and fro each time to get missing items (such as cutlery, or sauce).Our mains were served 40 minutes past our arrival, and my pan seared barramundi fillet was excellent. However, on the plates of our main course, you could see that there had been a flurry of activity in the kitchen as the sauce that was splattered on the plates were not wiped and cleaned up before being served to us. Our guess was that the kitchen might have been missing one or two staff today, resulting in the haphazardness.Then we waited for our dessert and tea to be served. While waiting, we noticed the blackboard with the daily soup of the day written, as well as some other dishes that were on offer. It seemed that the words too, had been hurriedly written on the blackboard.

894,il Bel Paese,Wan Chai,Italian,3.3,143.0,,"Came here to try out the buffet. Management is defintely serious about how this big ""flagship"" store is doing, as Massimo, the purveyor of all good things from Italy, was there to oversee operations. The head waiter is also an Italian guy I think, plus the chef Massimo (another gentleman by that name) was at the buffet station cooking. So definitely very Italian from the the looks of things.The small space on the second floor of the building was almost full. I am not sure what it was, it could have been the various ""professional-looking"" people who greeted us on entry, the two-flight upward climb on pretty narrow wooden stairs, the low ceiling, brick floors, or cramped tables (I had the leg of my chair kicked/other patrons scraped pass several times). It was just the feel of the place that reminded me of a youth hostel/community hall/boarding school dining room. Light italian music was in the background, but it did almost nothing to lift that uneasy feeling. I sound like a whinger and maybe I am one, but it\'s something that flies in the face of Italianess, the quintessential cheery and homey cuisine.The food, I am relieved to say, provided much more comfort. To sate my craving for proteins, and because the crowd at the salad/cold dishes section was pretty daunting, I made a beeline for the hot dishes. There were three on offer: small rectangles of cut-up lasagne, a roulade, and a cheese frittata with tomato sauce. I especially savoured the fact that they put a generous bowl of shaved parmesan next to the lasagne, very thoughtful indeed. The lasagne was the best of the lot, seasoned well with rosemary, layered with a good amount of meat and even some green peas, plus it was piping hot. The only problem if at all was that the lasagne pasta was a bit too soft for my liking, but of course it\'s difficult to bake and keep lasagne warm and not have to sacrifice the texture of the pasta in the process. The roulade (I suspect it was a braciola?) was the next good thing - tender but without losing it\'s meaty texture, and with an egg filling in the centre. The cheese frittata was the weakest, I couldn\'t discern any cheese in it and the outside was also a bit fried too brown, at least my piece was. For the cold dishes, the leafy salad was the best I\'ve had for a long time. The leaves were extremely fresh and crispy, and the rocket I think was the Italian variety and not the Australian one that has less bite. With a bit of balsamic and oil dressing, this was simple yet nice to eat (I wouldn\'t say delicious, but for just a few leaves it was close lol). Even the presentation of the salad bowl was very inviting - a good job of the person who put it altogether. Another winner was the onion soup - it was laden with onion and some potato cubes, and I was offloading the shaved parmesan into it  I only wished it was hotter and therefore even heartier. I also had two thin slices of garlic bread, one with black olive paste and a meaty paste (I couldn\'t tell what it was). I recall from my Italian classes long ago that this would be known as spuntini eaten in the afternoon, no matter, the taste of the olive paste was pretty decent, so I was not complaining. The seafood potato salad was also ok, with pieces of calamari, mussels and small prawns. The tomato pasta salad (trofie pasta) was the least impressive, although the texture was a perfect al dente. This is however not the place if you are a sweet fiend. They had but only three dessert chioces, and I wouldn\'t count melon as one, so you only have two: a slice of plain cake and mini ramekins of panna cotta with a bit of strawberry. Despite the narrow choice, the panna cotta was probably one of the best I\'ve had in Hong Kong - very creamy, quite some vanilla, and not too wobbly so that it was really a pudding, a fault I find with a lot of local renditions. Consistency was just right, and even the size was justifiable, as the taste was strong and rich. The cake was also not bad, very eggy and a bit retro - it reminded me of local bakeries way back when they used real eggs in their baking lol. Coffee  was a crowd-pleasing ""bimbo"" blend (coffee drinkers would probably know what I mean here hehe), but at least the crema was quite respectable, although there was only a very weak/no after taste. Still, the seriousness of the place was stifling - maybe because the big boss was there? I find this quite difficult to get over. At $130 with 10% service charge, it\'s not unreasonable to expect a few more warm smiles, more types of dessert (perhaps some biscotti?), and no one kicking the leg of your chair.'",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/wan-chai-il-bel-paese/34680?tc=rvw2&con=recRvw

I would say we had tried many items on their menu already.This Fashion Walk restaurant was pretty empty even during lunch on a Sunday. We didn't have to wait at all and not all seats were taken during our visit.This time we also ordered many different items to try.Sashimi PlatterDeluxe Sushi Platter$ 2920Deluxe Sushi Platter$ 292We ordered this Deluxe Sashimi Platter to try. The giant prawns were super fresh and huge! They were so crispy and meaty. But the heads were lack of fresh prawn yellow flavour. The scallops were also fresh and meaty. Other sashimi were not so pleasing: the octopus was not crispy at all; the toro had tendons so didn't melt in my mouth; nothing special with tuna, salmon and  but they were all thick cut. Given the price, it was only ok.SushiSalmon sushi$ 200Salmon sushi$ 20We only ordered 2 types of sushi. This was Salmon sushi which had nothing special. The salmon sashimi were too thin. Not recommended.Deluxe Sea Eel$ 770Deluxe Sea Eel$ 77The other sushi we ordered was Deluxe Sea Eel, which was freshly grilled with eel sauce served on the side. There were loads of small bones but edible even for kids. It was delicious but a bit too thin.RollsWe ordered two types of rolls to share.Dragon Roll$ 310Dragon Roll$ 31Dragon Roll$ 310Dragon Roll$ 31The Dragon Rolls came with eel sauce on the side. They were so huge with loads of raw veggies but just some eel.Seared Wagyu with Sakura Shrimp Roll$ 750Seared Wagyu with Sakura Shrimp Roll$ 75Seared Wagyu with Sakura Shrimp Roll seemed pretty appealing. However, there was nothing special with the seared Wagyu on top, which was claimed to be from Japan. The crispy texture of loads of sakura shrimp stuffings was interesting though. But given the so-so seared Wagyu on top, it was not really worth the price.Hand RollSoft Shell Crab Hand Roll$ 310Soft Shell Crab Hand Roll$ 31We just orderedSoft Shell Crab Hand Roll which had crispy seaweed and soft shell crab with avocado and salad dressing. It was ok.AppetisersTempura Shrimp Ricepaper Spring Roll with Mango Sauce...$ 640Tempura Shrimp Ricepaper Spring Roll with Mango Sauce...$ 64It was so interesting to see these spring rolls at a Japanese restaurant. TheseTempura Shrimp Ricepaper Spring Roll with Mango Saucewas pretty good. There were freshly deep fried and crispy tempura shrimps which were meaty too. There were loads of veggies and the ricepaper was very thin. The mango sauce was very appetising. Highly recommended indeed.GrilledGrilled Chicken Thigh in Charcoal Style Sauce$ 750Grilled Chicken Thigh in Charcoal Style Sauce$ 75This Grilled Chicken Thigh in Charcoal Style Sauce was the best dish of the meal! They claimed that the chicken was from Japan which should be true as the chicken was so tender and juicy. They were cooked so well, obviously charcoal grilled which made them smell so good. I felt that my throat started to get sore after eating. The skin was so crispy that even I who never eat chicken skin finished all. There were 6 pieces altogether. Good dish indeed. Some yuzu pepper on the side to eat with the chicken. By the way, it could have been even better if they were less salty.CookedWe ordered 2 cooked items which were both pots. However, they were so disappointing.Beef Pot with Tofu$ 970Beef Pot with Tofu$ 97TheBeef Pot with Tofu was alot worse than last time we first tried it at Hysan Place. The quality of the beef was just so so. The soup was very plain just with beef fat. The quality of the tofu was good though, even me who never liked tofu ate a few pieces. There was no big yummy mushrooms like last time. The transparent noodles were nice though.Hiroshima Oyster and Veggies Hot Pot with Miso$ 860Hiroshima Oyster and Veggies Hot Pot with Miso$ 86ThisHiroshima Oyster & Veggies Hot Pot with Miso was even worse. There werejust three oysters with 2 big and 1 small. The quality was just so so. The miso soup was ok but not particularly good, seemingly free of MSG though. The veggies were just average.Overall I would say that the quality of the food varied quite a lot, with some really good items like the appetiser and grilled dish but some were really disappointing like the hot pots. The sushi and sashimi seemed to be standard but the good thing was that there were quite a number of creative dishes and rolls not easily found elsewhere. That said, prices were of course not cheap. Service was pretty good though from all the servers I had come across. An ok place to go but not somewhere I would go back from time to time."", 'There were so many choices of different restaurants @ Hysan Place. We chose Sen-ryo as the queue was not long on a Saturday afternoon. Just waited for a short while before we got our seats. It was a very small restaurant with not many seats. Most seats were at the circulation belt.Daily Specials0Daily SpecialsWe decided to try some new items rather than typical sushi. The Daily Specials Menu was a good start!Kuro soi & Mejina$ 1230Kuro soi & Mejina$ 123Kuro soi & MejinaThese two fishes were pretty similar. The radish on top was so strong to have somewhat masked the freshness of the sashimi. They were ok but not particularly outstanding. That said, the fishes were fresh although tasted just like other normal white fishes.Hirame$ 620Hirame$ 62Same for the Hirame which was the other item on the Daily Specials Menu. Also very strong radish with nothing particularly outstanding. Tasted just like other normal white fishes.Sen-ryo Handroll$ 750Sen-ryo Handroll$ 75ThisSen-ryo Handroll was quite good. Seaweed was super crispy. Ingredients were fresh with quite a lot of minced tuna and fresh uni as well as salmon roes and spring onion. Could find some minced tuna even at the tip of the handroll.Beef pot with tofu$ 970Beef pot with tofu$ 97Beef pot with tofu was served super hot. There were 3 big whole tofu cubes, 3 Chinese mushrooms and quite some fatty beef slices (all cut into small slices). The veggie ingredients were very fresh and delicious! Could tell that they were of good quality. The beef slices were so-so. The soup was tasty and seemed to be free of MSG. Just a bit too oily given the fatty beef. There were quite a lot of transparent noodles which were smooth and absorbed the soup pretty well. Overall, quite a good pot of good value for money.Cold udon$ 460Cold udon$ 46The quality of the cold udon was also quite good with super thin udon served on ice cubes to keep them cool. There were some accompanying minced ginger and spring onions for serving with the udon. The soy sauce was ok too.Brownie with Vanilla Ice-cream$ 530Brownie with Vanilla Ice-cream$ 53It took us ages to wait for the Brownie with Vanilla Ice-cream but it was pretty good. The brownie was so crunchy although not of those typical thick texture. It went great with the vanilla ice-cream although it was just slightly warm. It was decorated very well with the chocolate sauce.Seating was quite comfortable as we managed to occupy cart seats by the circulation belt. Service was a bit slow as our orders generally took ages to arrive and our used utensils were not collected for a long long time after they were finished. However, the quality of food was quite good given the price, despite the relatively disappointing Daily Specials sushi. Could come back again!', ""Sen-ryo is one of the better fast food sushi restaurants in Hong Kong. Sashimi is mostly quite fresh, and if you order separately from the kitchen you'll get fresh, crispy nori. The temakis are also tasty and fresh. I especially like the soft shell crab temaki. They serve a big range of food, from shabu-shabu beef hot pots to grilled miso cod to raw beef sashimi. Everything tastes decent and satisfying for the price (expect to pay around $200 per person if you're not very hungry, and up to $300 if you are).A big fan of sea urchin, I am often disappointed by senryo as they almost always don't have any in stock! But the good side of that is that when they do stock uni, it'll be quite fresh. My guess is that when uni of a certain grade is short in supply, they'd rather go without than lower the grade. But sometimes they can still smell a bit fishy, so I am not sure if the stock shortage has to do with poor management. Just make sure you check with the sushi chefs.Seating is comfortable if you can secure the sofa seats. It's possible to sit on the cozy sofas and chat for hours. Food at this price range is roughly the same everywhere, so the dining environment is important and makes a big difference.00""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/causeway-bay-sen-ryo/453124?tc=rvw2&con=rvw

Although not so thick, it was ok and delicious but with nothing special.Seared Eel$ 840Seared Eel$ 84Seared Eel were delicious but again with nothing special.Then we turned to those disappointing items.Seared Beef, Jumbo Red Shrimp & Japanese Jumbo Scallop...0Seared Beef, Jumbo Red Shrimp & Japanese Jumbo Scallop...Seared Beef, Jumbo Red Shrimp & Japanese Jumbo ScallopSeared Beef Sushi $32 + 10% for 2: how come the 2 leftmost looked so bad while the 2 rightmost looked so much better? The seared beef was so dry and rough. I had expected that they were more cooked and juicy. It was really not recommended.Jumbo Red Shrimp ($28+10% for 1) was really quite huge but the quality was not so much better than that at Genki Sushi! Value for money seemed not so good.Japanese Jumbo Scallop ($22+10% for 1) looked so not jumbo but were actually quite thick. It was fresh indeed. It seemed to be a better value for money than the jumbo red shrimp.Menu0MenuCherry Blossom Sea Bream Sushi Platter (with pickled sakura, with ponzu jelly, seared)...$ 1500Cherry Blossom Sea Bream Sushi Platter (with pickled sakura, with ponzu jelly, seared)...$ 150Cherry Blossom Sea Bream Sushi Platter (with pickled sakura, with ponzu jelly, seared)...$ 1500Cherry Blossom Sea Bream Sushi Platter (with pickled sakura, with ponzu jelly, seared)...$ 150Cherry Blossom Sea Bream Sushi Platter (with pickled sakura, with ponzu jelly, seared)These were seasonal items. The one with pickled sakura (leftmost) was too dry and thin. The one in the middle with ponzu jelly was better as it was less dry. The seared one on the rightmost was the best, so thick and smelt pretty good. Overall, quite disappointing.Sea Urchin Hand Roll$ 640Sea Urchin Hand Roll$ 64This sea urchin hand roll was so disappointing too as there was so little sea urchin.By the way, I was quite surprised that there was no wasabi in the rice. I recalled that wasabi was present in the sushi during our last visit at the Hysan branch. The pickled sliced gingers sucked as they were so watery and too sweet.In short, the quality of food was uneven among different food items. It was really not cheap and I really don't understand why people could spend the time and money for a lunch like this. Given the long waiting time, there were definitely better choices nearby."", 'After two months I finally have a friend from Vancouver in town!  Long before I came back Ive already heard her talk about how she loves going to Sen-yro whenever shes back in HK so naturally this is where we decided to meet for our first lunch.We were at the IFC location on Saturday afternoon and there were 38 tables ahead of us!!! =0= Good thing they have those ticket machines where you can enter your phone number and theyll call you when youre 10 tables away. We got something to drink and walked around the mall for around half an hour before we were called back.The place is fairly small so I can see why we had to wait that long for a table.On each table you can find the standard pickled ginger and matcha powder (although on the non-conveyer belt tables youd have to ask the waiters to refill your cup with hot water anyway which kind of defeats the purpose, but anyway) and the best of all, freshly grated wasabi!!Wasabi0WasabiSince I eat cheap sushi most of the time (lol) and I dont always encounter fresh wasabi so this got me really excited! It tasted saltier than regular wasabi and there were some nut-like pieces in it too. Actually, my friend said it probably wasnt wasabi since it was too pungent  probably some sort of horseradish. Nevertheless I thought it was really good and I couldnt stop eating it To start I ordered tamagoTamago0Tamago-It was served warm but since this was the first dish served, and being the polite & courteous friend that I am ;) I waited for my friend to return from the bathroom before eating it so it was cold by thentoo bad!-Anyhow I thought it looked a bit dry at first it actually wasnt too bad. The texture is kind of bean-curd-like, similar to the one at The Mon but the taste is so much better. It was eggy and not too sweet.Next came the nigiri that I ordered  Hamachi, Otoro, Extra Large Scallop and Ika Noodles with Yuzu PepperHamachi, Otoro, Scallop, Ika with Yuzu Pepper1Hamachi, Otoro, Scallop, Ika with Yuzu PepperHamachi, Otoro, Scallop, Ika with Yuzu Pepper0Hamachi, Otoro, Scallop, Ika with Yuzu Pepper-Hamachi & Otoro  both of these were disappointing espeically the otoro. They werent fresh and tasted metallic & fishy. I saved the otoro for last so that it could reach room temperature but even then there was no oily surface that Id hoped to see.-The Extra Large Scallop was nice! Actually, this was the reason why my friend even wanted to come in the first place. They give you a fairly large piece of scallop, sliced in half and fanned out over the rice. The taste is decent as its fairly sweet, but really, we only ordered this so that we could sink our teeth into a huge piece of scallop which is one of the most satisfying feelings you can ever get omnomnom-The sliced ika noodles was interesting, mostly because of the yuzu pepper. Both were tasty on its own but Im not sure if they necessarily compliment each otherOur second platter was less interesting  Aburi Salmon, another piece of the scallop and red clam sashimi (thats what I think it is).Aburi Salmon, Scallop, Red Clam0Aburi Salmon, Scallop, Red Clam-Aburi Sashimi  Im glad I ordered this rather than the regular one. I saw the regular ones on other tables and it looked like low-quality farm salmon. Granted, it was the cheapest thing on the menu but I would have expected a teensy bit more from Sen-ryo. Anyhow, aburi-ing the salmon did help make it taste better texture wise and I loved eating it with lots of yummy wasabi ^_^-Red Clam Scallop  nothing too special about this. It was like a slimier geoduck sashimi but not as sweet. I wouldnt order this next time.One thing to note is that the service here was good. The dishes were served fairly quickly and the staff was polite and helpful.Our total turned out to be around $280 which is rather expensive considering we didnt actually order that much food. Id definitely come back though if given the chance.', ""Salmon sushi - Favourite!0Salmon sushi - Favourite!This salmon sushi is one of my favourite dishes ever! The rice is delicious and the salmon is so soft and amazing! I particularly like this branch at IFC, as I feel their salmon sushi is superior than at their other branches.The dragon and california rolls are delicious as well. And I personally love fois gras, but the one we ordered at this branch was just average.I could do lunch and dinner with just the above dishes and I would be over the moon!Service is decent but is never great, so don't expect much. Go for the food!""",www.openrice.com/en/hongkong/restaurant/central-sen-ryo/13939?tc=rvw2&con=rvw
